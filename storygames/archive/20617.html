It might work, it's colorful, it opens up new possibilities for consequences.<br/><br/>Or, suppose I attempt a multi-step solution: <i>I race up the stairs, then once he's pursuing me, I turn on a dime and jump down at him, using gravity to aid my blow.</i>  I like this even better!  It's colorful and consequence-abetting, and also a bit clever, and there's some suspense as we see whether the steps unfold as intended.<br/><br/>But now we get to system.  "It might work" and "it's clever" need to be supported there, or I'll be disappointed.  If our system is freeform and the GM buys what I'm selling, great!  If it's a difficulties &amp; bonuses system, and the GM and I can agree on a target number and which situational rules apply ("higher ground +1", "bull rush +2", etc.), also great!  But if we haven't enjoyed those systems and we're trying FATE or Marvel Heroic or some other modern game with mechanics for creating an Asset or Advantage or positive Condition or whatever -- well, to date I haven't loved those.<br/><br/>In my experience, "create an asset" gets rules-first really quick, and winds up divorced from the fictional particulars.  Great ideas and barely sufficient ideas all get lumped into the same "you performed that game action so now you have the +2 available for use" bag.  Also, spending the action to create the asset is often not worth it if we take actions in turns, because I'm losing time or hit points or whatever while trying to tackle a problem in a greater number of steps.  And, finally, once there's a system in place for creating assets, we run into trouble trying to match fictional positioning to that concept.  If my forward momentum from charging an "asset"?  If it isn't, does that mean it's worthless, because I thought fictionally instead of mechanically?<br/><br/>Has anyone played a "create an asset" system which didn't produce these downsides?  The rules concept actually appeals to me quite a bit, so I'm curious!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452321/#Comment_452321" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T22:06:02+00:00" title="April 19, 2016 10:06PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if I would go so far as to say that it manages to completely eliminate the downsides, but one thing I thought interesting about Shinobigami was that this kind of "asset" system can only be used by other players for your character, rather than you using it for yourself. This feels more like a response to the game's structure, which often has characters acting alone or in small groups, so it gives the other players a chance to contribute to scenes in which their characters aren't the primary subject.<br/><br/>While it does relegate a player's own description of their character's actions to being simply atmospheric, it also means that you don't ever risk losing something for trying to undertake too complicated an action (though that probably has as much to do with the game's "one resolution per scene" ethos). Because of the sometimes-PvP nature of the game and the limitations on when the rule can be invoked by another player, it's not something you can always rely on happening, so it's less likely to "get rules-first." And because it's a genre-emulation game (inspired by classic ninja fiction tropes, for what that's worth) and takes a very "you are directing scenes like a movie director" approach,  there is a pretty big bag of tropes and cliches that you can readily reach into and slip into a scene that will fit with the fiction.<br/><br/>Like I said, I don't think that it's necessarily a good answer to your question. But I do think that the choice to off-load the decision as to how and when you get bonuses to the other players makes it feel, I don't know, slightly less problematic in general. Of course, it also can make you feel robbed of a particularly creative description of your own action, or possibly make you feel discouraged from doing it at all, so it could also be introducing its own new problem in the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452323/#Comment_452323" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T22:41:08+00:00" title="April 19, 2016 10:41PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your example would not involve the creation of an Asset in Marvel Heroic or an Aspect in Fate so it doesn't surprise me that doing either of those things in that situation would work out in a dissatisfying way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452333/#Comment_452333" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T04:19:01+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  4:19AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that this is solid gold RPG development territory, and to me it seems like one we could easily solve. (Well, maybe not, like, *easily* easily, but it's feasible.)<br/><br/>One key method I can think of is placing human judgement of the fiction first, and then constructing a framework of mechanical options which get applied accordingly. Your example of "+1 for high ground" is an example of this, but there could be other ways to do it.<br/><br/>Here's an example: <br/><br/>You're doing something, and suddenly a danger looms into view. Something is happening which threatens you, and you're in trouble. How do you deal with it?<br/><br/>Let's say the game is Apocalypse World-like: we have moves.<br/><br/>In this hypothetical* game, we have three available moves:<br/><br/>* <i>When you act to avoid a threat's immediate effects...</i><br/>* <i>When you make a last-ditch effort to mitigate the damage from a threat...</i><br/>* <i>When you act to eliminate a threat for good...</i><br/><br/>And each has appropriate outcomes, like getting ready of the threat entirely, slowing it down for a moment, or reducing its effects.<br/><br/>When you go to do something about the threat, we must consider: <br/><br/>The actions you're taking, could they eliminate the threat altogether? No? Then it's not the third move... Would they help you avoid it? Yes, ok, it's the first move.<br/><br/>Something like that could work, I think.<br/><br/>*: Yeah, right...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452334/#Comment_452334" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T04:24:44+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  4:24AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On another topic, I don't know if I agree with you on the "freeform" example. It has the bonus of human judgement but the drawback of not knowing how to proceed afterwards.<br/><br/>For instance, imagine you make an attempt at something difficult. My enemy is running across the courtyard, and I throw a dart at him. The GM considers this for a moment, and describes that you didn't notice the wind and therefore your dart misses by a hand's breadth.<br/><br/>You might have time for a second throw. Do you go for it? What are your odds?<br/><br/>Sometimes it seems like you have a guaranteed success on your hands: "Ok, I adjust for the wind and throw again!"<br/><br/>But it could also be totally hopeless: The GM has decided that this shot is too difficult for you.<br/><br/>And it's almost impossible to tell the difference without asking outright. (And what can the GM really say, if you ask outright, without giving away the outcome of the potential action?)<br/><br/>This sort of thing can be really tricky to handle. I'd love to hear any tips for doing so; I've seen many such awkward situations in play.<br/><br/>(My own approach is to try to work a choice into the matter, with clear consequences: "Ok, you can try that again, but it will cost you X. Do you want to?" Maybe in this case I'd say, "If you threw all your darts - including the poisoned ones - you'd probably have a good chance of getting lucky and hitting her. But you won't have time to check which dart you're throwing or aim carefully, so anything could happen. What do you do?")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452348/#Comment_452348" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T07:47:44+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  7:47AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I do think that the choice to off-load the decision as to how and when you get bonuses to the other players makes it feel, I don't know, slightly less problematic in general.

I'll call them Approaches.<br/><br/>So, yeah, a fictional situation arises, my character responds, and when we want to see how that response works out, we:<br/><br/>- classify the situation so as to pick the right Approaches list<br/>- classify the Approach so as to pick the right outcomes list<br/>- roll for which outcome actually happens<br/><br/>I think that has potential!  I only see readings of type, not quality, though.  I don't want a system that's entirely mute on whether my idea was genius or useless.<br/><br/>I also think we need outcomes with specific mechanical teeth.  Going from <i>intent: kick guy down stairs</i> to <i>outcome: put opponent in vulnerable position</i> to <i>narration: "you kick him down the stairs"</i> adds nothing.  We ultimately need to parse my idea in terms of hit point loss or whatever the key currencies of combat are.<br/><br/>I guess if each outcome nicely matches mechanics (e.g. opponent loses 2 HP and will defend at -2 next round and misses their next attack) with the fictional particulars that allow that outcome to occur (can't get the Brutal Knockdown benefits without narrating a thing which could then, upon success, be classified as a brutal knockdown), then maybe we're in a happy place, but now I'm starting to sound like Pathfinder...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452349/#Comment_452349" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T07:49:18+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  7:49AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I attacked this problem from a different perspective. I created a rule system that formed itself around what the players wanted to achieve rules-wise.<br/><br/>In combat, you had a couple of combat maneuvers that was combined with the attack: Lower you chance to hit to do more damage; delay your action to increase your chance to hit; lower your chance to hit to do a quick attack; lower both your own and the opponent's chances to succeed.<br/><br/>The rules stated that if the players wanted to use these maneuvers, then they had to describe how it looked like after the roll, but it happened that they described before the roll. The game master then interpreted what they wanted and declared a combat maneuver that affected the combat roll. Did they sneak up behind their back? Seems like a delayed maneuver. Did they jump down on someone? Seems like they wanted to do more damage. Did they throw something in someone's face? That will decrease both combatants' values.<br/><br/>Sometimes I asked them what they wanted to achieve when I wasn't sure what they intended to achieve when it came to the numbers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452350/#Comment_452350" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T07:53:18+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  7:53AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 7:55AM by David_Berg.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you threw all your darts . . . you'd probably have a good chance of getting lucky and hitting her.</blockquote>That is the essential part.

Maybe the GM decides, a la AW, or the opponent gets some of these options, or whatever.<br/>* On a not-so-great roll, the GM picks some applicable options, but only up to a certain limit. (And maybe gives one to the opposition, as well.)<br/>* On a good roll, the GM picks all the options which seem applicable. ("Ok, you're attacking with additional momentum, so let's say you pierce the armour - that's "get past defenses", and you "damage the enemy".)<br/>* On a really unusually good roll, the GM does the same, and/or the player gets to choose an additional one. (Or the GM is called to choose an additional option which is surprising or unexpected, on top of the ones which seem fitting to the action.)<br/><br/>I've been thinking about this kind of thing for a while, and I think some nice middle ground between "rules and effects-based" and "freeform player judgement" could be found. I haven't taken the time to develop something in detail, but, as you can see, I've been pondering.<br/><br/>As for communicating the odds, that's great when there are dice in play. You're right that getting that in the open solves a lot of these issues. When it becomes really tricky is in freeform play, which is what I thought we were talking about (you said in your original post that "if our system is freeform, then great!"). If you can't communicate odds because there's no random element, and the player knows that ultimately you're just deciding anyway, how do you do THAT?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452408/#Comment_452408" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T20:28:24+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  8:28PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Like, okay, it doesn't do what you're ~inspired~ by.

Assets in Marvel Heroic and Aspects in Fate Core don't actually express anything about your (or your character's) cleverness/effectiveness/coolness (more on this division below.)  That is, they might, but don't necessarily.  They have a mechanical/fictional weight all their own.<br/><br/>Your core problem is instead that you want to be able to do something that you feel should give you a leg up on the bad guys, more than the dull-eyed player lazing next to you who just describes an attack - perhaps you're clever, cool, or effective, or perhaps your character is. And there are many times and contexts in which you are disappointed to find that you thought you were doing something really great and nobody else cared, or worse, thought you were doing something stupid, and you couldn't call on mechanics to demonstrate you were right and they were wrong (and they couldn't either.)<br/><br/>What you have in this situation is an <i>aesthetic mismatch</i>. not a mechanical hole that can be fixed.  A guy who grew up watching 1950s Westerns is going to think of cinematic gunfights a lot differently from a lady who grew up watching 1990s Hong Kong gangster movies. Both can be playing in a cinematic gunfight, even with the same broad concept of genre and mechanics to accomplish it, but they'll hate, hate, haaaaate each other's contributions. <br/><br/>So I do think the correct answer is not in mechanics but in social level agreements and discussions about how to use the mechanics of whatever game you're playing to accomplish this.  Famously, aesthetic conflicts are not resolvable in any way other than mutual agreement.  I suspect that there are ways to use even Aspects and Assets in a way that would accomplish what you want in certain contexts! But honestly, I don't give out a lot of bonuses for advantages or disadvantages in my games; the other player characters and the logistics of system normally provides far more of an advantage than "the high ground" ever could - in the end being a little higher for one stab of one sword is a drop in the bucket compared to just "being a PC."  I would definitely change my practice if you and the other players asked me to, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452458/#Comment_452458" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-21T09:28:46+00:00" title="April 21, 2016  9:28AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2016 9:41AM by David_Berg.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And there are many times and contexts in which you are disappointed to find that you thought you were doing something really great and nobody else cared, or worse, thought you were doing something stupid, and you couldn't call on mechanics to demonstrate you were right and they were wrong (and they couldn't either.)</blockquote>\nNope!  That's not it at all.  I agree that that's <i>a</i> problem in play -- it just doesn't happen to be mine.  I tend not to over-inflate my ideas, and I tend to play with pretty agreeable people, so, "I think I was awesome but no one else does," is super rare.<br/><br/>My problem is when my cool idea doesn't smoothly fit into the mechanics <i>even when everyone else at the table is down with it</i>.  I mean, sure, my FATE GM could ad lib any old thing, like a +2 bonus, or discarding my worst rolled die, or even "it just works".  But that guy wanted to play FATE instead of freeform in part because he wanted answers to scenarios like these.  And, speaking just for one dude I know, he thought Aspects were those answers!  "Dave comes up with a creative situational action, and tags in an Aspect!"  I'm not blaming FATE for the fact that it didn't work out the way we would have liked.  I'm just wondering about alternatives, and I find the Asset or Aspect level of category-based abstraction more appealing than (e.g.) the "endless list of micro-specific moves" approach, where we flip a bunch of pages until we find "downward jumping slash" on page 245 or something.<br/><br/>I also think there's some virtue in covering bases other than "total clear agreement between me and the GM that what I did was awesome".  There's also agreement that what I did was entertaining but non-optimal, or agreement that what I did was high-risk high-reward, or agreement that what I did is kinda hard to gauge... or even occasionally maybe I did something for roleplay reasons that we both agree is totally stupid!  And then there's also "close enough", agree-to-not-100%-agree scenarios.  I don't expect any ruleset to fix <i>true</i> disagreement, but for all these <i>other</i> cases, I can at least imagine possibilities.<br/><br/>Maybe the best possibilities don't overlap much with assets and advantages and the like, but I dunno, I haven't played those to death the way I have with some other approaches, so perhaps there's cool options there that I haven't encountered yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452459/#Comment_452459" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-21T09:38:50+00:00" title="April 21, 2016  9:38AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, as for freeform, there's all different kinds of freeform.

Doing away with most abstractions in representing an action situation (not <i>all</i> abstractions - f'rex, AW includes abstract Harm) and especially with boardgamey <i>turns</i>. Only retaining the rules of conversation and aesthetic conventions of the game fiction as our ordering structure. Emphasizing fictional positioning and leverage - i.e. what we describe, both general descriptions and minute details, matters more than the game's existing abstractions for most (but not all) concerns.<br/>Of course, the specific agenda &amp; principles of AW are key to making this work. Specifically, when I'm MCing AW I'm not invested in the <i>outcome</i> of a fight, like, at all (because I'm looking at my NPCs through crosshair and playing to find out what happens, and also because I've disclaimed any decision-making regarding survival of the PCs, which is the other players' and the abstract harm rules' concern, not mine). Thus my role in a fight scene is strictly that of <i>choreographer</i> and stage director, and I find that entertaining, not at all overwhelming. Notably, when I tried something similar back when I didn't have access to those agenda, principles and tools (and man, have I tried!) it <i>did</i> often feel overwhelming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452598/#Comment_452598" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-24T02:20:06+00:00" title="April 24, 2016  2:20AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2016 2:22AM by David_Berg.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Catching up to various comments here:\n<blockquote>Wait, so you want a system to mediate something that you both actually agree on? If everyone agrees on the range of appropriate rewards, what will any system ever add to that interaction except suffering?</blockquote>\nAgreeing that an action is cool and might help a fictional endeavor while entailing new risks is one thing.  Translating "might help" and "entails new risks" into system terms is another.  It's that second step for which I'm seeking new alternatives.  (Well, and maybe also the part where you're reminded or required to think about whether it entails new risks.)\n<blockquote>When a character attempts something, you have a list of possible effects. <br/><br/>In combat, perhaps they are things like "damage the enemy", "create an advantage", "overwhelm or get past defenses", "move to a better position".<br/><br/>Then your system's output does something like this:<br/><br/>* On a good roll, the GM picks all the options which seem applicable. ("Ok, you're attacking with additional momentum, so let's say you pierce the armour - that's "get past defenses", and you "damage the enemy".)</blockquote>Yeah, I think pre-made categories have some potential.  I guess the goal would be to have broad enough categories that you don't wind up with a Pathfinder-like list, but narrow enough categories that the specifics of character action don't matter.  I mean, I'm fine if my jumping slash invokes the same rules as all other "surprise moves" and "momentum assists"; I just don't want it to invoke the same rules as all other "combat improv".  Actually, hmm, maybe multiple categories is a good way to have emergent complexity without exhaustive lists.  If my jumping slash is TWO action types, then maybe we can define action types more simply.<br/><br/>I wonder if there's any virtue in defining types of set-up approaches.  Similar to Blades in the Dark's mission approaches and your proposed Moves above which I wanted to call Approaches, but attempting to divvy up and categorize the space of advantage-seeking.  Too broad?  Haven't thought this through, just wanted to type it out before forgetting.\n<blockquote>As for communicating the odds, that's great when there are dice in play. You're right that getting that in the open solves a lot of these issues. When it becomes really tricky is in freeform play, which is what I thought we were talking about (you said in your original post that "if our system is freeform, then great!"). </blockquote>No no no, my opening post was intended to convey "we already know how to do freeform, we already know how to stack +1s, now let's talk about a <i>different</i> solution that maybe we <i>don't</i> know how to apply to this sort of play yet."<br/><br/>So, back to play that <i>isn't</i> freeform, I'm still pondering the best way to distinguish dumb ideas from great ideas from risky ideas etc.  Maybe there are negative categories like "leaves you vulnerable" and "is a longshot" which the GM can invoke?<br/><br/>(You know, with a good enough matching of actions to outcomes, I guess dice aren't <i>necessarily</i> required... but I think "likelihood of working" is a frequent fictional concern, and dice odds are certainly handy for representing that.)\n<blockquote>I use the dice . . . as a way to . . . determine if a ruling made on the go applies</blockquote>Yeah, I've done this too.  Once a group is good at inventing/applying "if success, X happens; if failure, Y happens" then it's kinda hard to go wrong.  Right now, though, I'm wondering if I can get contributions I like from rules systems in there.\n<blockquote>Apocalypse World, the way I play it . . .

With something like "I want to create a fire attack!" where we already know what the mechanical results of success will be, it seems fine to let the GM slap a difficulty (plus whatever conditions fictionally apply) on the attempt and roll for it.  The difference between "clever idea" and "dumb idea" is manifest in two ways: the utility of the achievement, and the attainability of the achievement.<br/><br/>I wonder, though, what happens in my stair-jump example?  Do we need to flip through the book until we find a category like "fire-based attack" that fits my action, so that we know what its effects will be?<br/><br/>Also, even if I do use a rules-defined action or quantity, do we need to look up how it interfaces with different fictional particulars?  Suppose I try a fire-based attack on a tar monster.  Does it do more damage?  Less?<br/><br/>Maybe these details are beside the point, though, and the relevant bit for this thread is "name what advantage you'd like to achieve and then roll for that".  My stair-jumping guy wants to achieve enough extra force to penetrate his foe's armor.  So we could roll for whether I'm able to successfully get the force of my fall into a slash aimed at him, with the GM doing their best to arbitrate how tough that'd be.  Succeed in that roll, and boom, the extra force is there.<br/><br/>At some point (probably before the roll, so I can confirm that it's worth bothering), we also have to label that armor-penetrating extra force mechanically (+5 damage, e.g.). <br/><br/>I'm not sure what I think of this.  I think a lot comes down to the particulars.  If it's "figure out the odds and effects on your own" or "find them in an exhaustive reference book", I might be a little underwhelmed.  I do like the process, though, of defining your hopes and rolling to see if you achieve them, on this particular scale.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452602/#Comment_452602" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-24T02:42:28+00:00" title="April 24, 2016  2:42AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sounds to me like you handle clever advantage-seeking with your group's freeform skills and AW doesn't stop you.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nCould be read that way, sure.

That, and having clear Agendas and Principles, as I said. \n<blockquote>Ah!  Good to know.  I've actually been thinking about that -- carving out a niche for "is there anything you're doing here to try to maximize your efforts beyond the basic effort itself?"</blockquote>\nJust to be clear, in Anima Prime there's no dice for "basic effort": you <i>have to</i> Maneuver. Specifically, you start a battle scene with a number of dice in your Action pool, but (usually) no dice in your Strike pool. When you choose to Maneuver, you describe what awesome things you do and roll some dice from your Action pool, plus some bonus dice from your skill ratings and possibly traits. Other players can give you dice from their own Action pools as well, to compliment on your choice of maneuver, and the GM can grant you an Awesome token (but if they don't, you still get an Awesome token if you roll awesomely). You roll those and, depending on the number showing, dice go into your Strike pool or your Power pool (used to fuel your magical/psychic/whatever tricks) or back into your Action pool or are discarded. If there are dice in your Strike pool you can now spend an Awesome token to take a Strike action, rolling those dice vs. an opponent's defensive rating (successes turn into wounds and # wounds, typically four, take an opponent out of the fight); or you can save those Strike dice and take your Strike action at a later turn, in place of a Maneuver. Crucially, Strikes unlike Maneuvers are only described after rolling, or even kept an abstraction; whereas narrating Maneuvers is the focus of battle scenes.\n<blockquote>Making that one of the three sources of dice for a three-die pool, or something like that.  If it's constantly a factor, then hopefully whatever rules and judgments govern it will be mastered faster by the group.  </blockquote>\nOh, yes, on paper at least I always like the idea of "building up" a pool of dice from a list of factors. Like: one die if you're trained/skilled into the thing, one die if you're making use of your environment, one die if you've got the perfect equipment for it, and one die if you're changing your approach from one which didn't work last time\u2026 and no "default" die, of course: start from zero.\n<blockquote>Unfortunately, the first thing that comes to mind -- if GM thinks it's dumb; no die, if GM thinks it's sufficient, 1 die; if GM thinks it's brilliant, 2 dice -- isn't very interesting.</blockquote>\nThat's actually pretty close to how Sorcerer works, RAW. It's also the one thing I struggle with when GMing Sorcerer - having to make to many judgment calls about bonus dice - and I ended up trying to house-rule it away (sharing this responsibility with all players like fanmail, creating a short checklist of factors like the above to make it feel "objective"\u2026) but that's still a work-in-progress.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452625/#Comment_452625" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-25T15:47:13+00:00" title="April 25, 2016  3:47PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2016 3:58PM by WarriorMonk.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I'm not saying you shouldn't do what you think is fun, I'm just saying maybe be cautious about getting TOO involved in that kind of finicky pixel-hunting thing, if it's going to make you lose sight of the rest of the game.</blockquote>\nI'm with AccountingForTaste on this, you see, I tried something similar with a tag mechanic on a recent design I'm working on. At first I was excited at how I could convert everything to tags and let players combine them as they see fit, I even tried a table so players could clearly see which tags couldn't be combined at all and on top of that had an overview of what kind of things they could do. Then I noticed that I should add there a list of negative tags as some things can't be done without some specific risk, like you can't use a <i>heavy</i> weapon to make <i>quick</i>, <i>multiple</i> attacks.<br/><br/>So far so good, I was proud of this list, so I made a few more lists to get a more specific atmosphere for every major type of special abilities in the game, like "martial arts" "armed attacks", "magic", etc. It ended up filling half a page, but it was the equivalent of the whole rulebook on the character sheet.<br/><br/>A player complained about the character sheet looking too cramped and complex, so I reduced the tag lists to two generic ones of ten tags each, one positive and one negative, and left space for player to write only the tags their characters used, while I kept the large lists for GM use only. It was still good and left the Character sheet almost clean.<br/><br/>Testing time comes and then it hit me what was going wrong with this design. Players got analysis paralysis trying to decide the right combination of tags for each of their turns, increasing gameplay time twofold. And while this might not be an actual problem for some players, for me it meant that a task we usually do intuitivally in no time at all, was now being slowed down by a mechanic that didn't actually add too much of any other kind of fun to the game. Well, maybe added more layers to the tactical part, but then again, that wasn't something we actually didn't had before.<br/><br/>Tags, at least in the way I used them, won't work so well. In fact, anything that doesn't resemble usual human communication or adds extra layers over it will have this result. I mean, our brains actually use Tags unconsciously: both GMs and players quiclky identify specific words or phrases in the game conversation and engage with different game rules as a response. <br/><br/>Adding tags in this fashion is like adding an implied rule that says "Ok, now each time someone says <i>Quick Attack</i> you have to think both in the mental image of the PC making a quick attack  <i>and</i> the fact that she's talking about a tag, that implies that her character can do an additional attack" which, if you notice, it's just thinking the same thing twice.<br/><br/>That's where AW's "to do something, do it" shines, simplifying rules back to the conversation and negotiation. Maybe that's where your answer could be, in a mechanic to make negotiation less GM-dependable, maybe using a resource exchange to support a player's argument that then the GM can use later in another negotiation. Maybe everyone rolls to see who arbitrates that this time, maybe there's a vote or well, maybe just another way of using tags.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452630/#Comment_452630" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-25T16:39:20+00:00" title="April 25, 2016  4:39PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Adding tags in this fashion is like adding an implied rule that says "Ok, now each time someone says <i>Quick Attack</i> you have to think both in the mental image of the PC making a quick attack  <i>and</i> the fact that she's talking about a tag, that implies that her character can do an additional attack" which, if you notice, it's just thinking the same thing twice.<br/></blockquote>\n(I've never quite understood the point of AW-style Tags, and I haven't been able to explain why to other people.

I agree that lots of "extra" narration or rules-consultation for a +1 is a poor trade-off.  If the resolution system is "always roll; sometimes at -1, sometimes at +1, sometimes unmodified", then there's absolutely no point in spin-jump-slashes off stairs.<br/><br/>But, to me, that's kind of the problem.<br/><br/>I <i>like</i> spin-jump-slashes off stairs.  I like the orientation to the game and fiction whereby we consider whether such a move is brilliant or terrible or irrelevant.  And, for the sake of fostering that orientation, I'm happy to have the "extra" narration be <i>extremely</i> relevant.  Forget +1.  How about, "if this is a brilliant move, <i>your enemy is <b>dead</b></i>"?<br/><br/>The key, though, is something we haven't solved in this thread -- how to distinguish between Brilliant and Neat and Okay and Weak and how to match those to outcomes.  Maybe Corley's right that "brilliant" (etc.) is only determinable by inter-player agreement, so maybe we could take those 4 categories I just spat out and write outcome ranges for those, to be parsed back into fictional particulars in play?  <br/><br/>But then, sometimes brilliance is less about glorious success and more about staving off sure defeat, so a one-size-fits-all list wouldn't serve that.<br/><br/>That's an angle we could pursue, or not.  Without shoehorning this discussion into one particular direction system-wise, hopefully this clarifies what I'm pursuing here.  I want to reward concrete, clever, creative, detailed in-fiction problem-solving as strongly as I can.  Maybe that can include some sort of "useful entity" mechanical bit like an Asset, or maybe not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452686/#Comment_452686" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T05:59:28+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  5:59AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I want to reward concrete, clever, creative, detailed in-fiction problem-solving as strongly as I can.</blockquote>\nTorchbearer has the "Good Idea". Everything you do (roll) takes a turn except spellcasting or actions that fit in your character's Instinct. But if it's a concrete, clever, creative, not-necessarily-detailed, in-fiction solution, GM can say "Good Idea" and it doesn't take a turn.<br/><br/>Maybe the only way is inter-player agreement plus system-specific significant mechanical benefit... if so that goes on a checklist for game design that's good for you.

So we can decide if a move deserves an advantage because it matches up with some notion we have of, typically, tactics and combat: Attacking from the high-ground? Ok, advantage. Several backflips? Maybe not. (This is how <i>Torchbearer's</i> Good Idea works, but also D&amp;D DC adjudications since the dawn of time.)<br/><br/>If we shift the criteria to something else we can alter the genre of the game. So if my criteria is "being <i>awesome</i>" then perhaps describing all the backflippin' kung-fu gets you that advantage but merely attacking from the high-ground doesn't. How pedestrian. (This is how Whitewolf's <i>Exalted</i> plays out with stunts.) <br/><br/>So it's not about the description, or the advantage given, but what merits we're looking for. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452712/#Comment_452712" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T17:23:47+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  5:23PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2016 5:24PM by WarriorMonk.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok then, I started googling out "Deterministic combat system". First idea that hit me is <i>States</i>; a hit happens when your character is in a state like "ready" or "attacking" and your opponent is in another or a combination of others, like "blinded", "Guard down", "off balance", "distracted". You would definitely need to impose more than one state in you opponent to kill him and you will need to be in more than one state to be able to hit properly at a vital point, so that's where brilliant tactics come in play. The rest of the space between the attacker state and the defender state and how you switch from attacking to defending should be more or less left to negotiating in the fiction, perhaps with a resource like "stamina" to back up the negotiation.<br/><br/>With that you will have a more deterministic system, but still light enough so it doesn't overwhelm players and open enough so all kind of situations can be considered.

Say, hand axe attacks are always str+3. Momentum adds a fixed +3, leather armor only offers a protection of 1. But then reach comes into play. If you maneuvered right and your opponent is 5 feet away from you, you do full damage. If you were a bit too far or too close because the opponent moved, it's -2 to the damage. So, weapons have an optimal range and you need to take this in account before hitting, or you may rist doing less damage or even missing totally.<br/><br/>Before applying damage there's armor to be considered. Again, a fixed number is reduced from the attack and the rest is either enough to pierce through (depending on the armor material and the type of damage applied, of course) or just bound or get stuck on the defenses (if it's a wooden shield, for example)<br/><br/>Effects this may cause: players will try to maximize their chances by using ther weapon's reach and PCs with higher reach would strike first.

I often struggle with the whole Asset/Advantage thing, primarily because I'm looking to use it as a way to bribe my players to give me more than just, "I attack." I don't think that's why you're into it, but I'm hoping this might help with the whole "judging the quality of an asset" conundrum.\n<blockquote>If you take the default action, roll the standard die roll. <br/>If you flavor it up with something clever but risky, here's an extra die. <br/>The greater the risk inherent in the idea, the larger the extra die type (d4 to d20 for example). However, it's up to the player to decide the level of risk their character is willing to take in service of this maneuver. Think an idea is worth only a minor risk? Take a d4 or d6.<br/>The extra die adds to your total roll result, but carries a threat range. If it lands on that threat range, the inherent danger manifests along with the bonus granted from the roll.</blockquote>\nSo, my idea is this: Let the players define how clever they think an idea really is. The point of coupling it to danger is to keep them honest and have a player think twice before granting themselves a massive bonus for a half-baked idea. You're pretty sure that maneuver you came up with is incredibly clever and creative? Great, give it a larger die size, but do so knowing that it carries a greater risk. It's no longer just a 1 or 2 HP loss, now it can be stuff like hobbling your character, maybe as far as tearing a hole in the fabric of reality. Rather than do all the grunt work yourself, you could perhaps give players a guideline of what kind of danger a die type is worth: <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>d6s are minor injuries and setbacks </li><li>d8s are serious threats, but not life-threatening</li> <li>d10s are critical threats with the possibility of death</li> <li>d20s are assuredly life ending or horribly devastating threats</li></ul> Last but not least, each die type could have a scale of terrible that comes through. Ex: on a d6, 1 = Minimal Threat, 2 = Moderate threat, 3 = Full Threat. In any event, the players can use that guide to gauge the level of risk they take with any given die. It's really asking the player, how clever do you feel the idea is? So clever as to take a much higher risk seeing it come through? Admittedly, the flat percentage of threat manifesting is not ideal, but hopefully it's a starting point to work with. To return to your example:<br/><br/>Player decides to pull the old spin-jump stair attack. Excellent! They think its a clever idea and thus worth some mechanical advantage. It's up to them what extra die they pick up. Is this maneuver clever enough that it's worth taking on more danger? Theoretically, jumping from stairs can end in a horrible fall resulting in death or paralysis. Is the spin attack worth that outcome? If so, pick up a d10 and get cracking. If not, they'll pick up something smaller like a d6 or d8. The die the player chooses informs the GM what kind of risk they're willing to take. If that threat range comes true, the GM then imposes something fictionally appropriate and congruent with the threat level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452761/#Comment_452761" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-28T20:29:26+00:00" title="April 28, 2016  8:29PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, taking Luzelli's input and building over it to make it more deterministic: <br/><br/>-The player or the GM has the option of leaving things to chance, rolling the dice. No bonuses. GM may estimate the chances as he sees fit, but if player has a different estimate and reasons for it, we're back into the deterministic system.<br/><br/>-Character stats indicate what kind of things he may do, like amount of damage, max load  , speed of his attack, range, amount of times he can dodge or the speed of his dodge, etc without considering putting an effort to it. Whenever he does that, he spents stamina to increase his output.<br/><br/>-The thing is that the DC isn't known and even changes depending on the states the characters are into, so this part of the combat is a bet. You might not be putting enough effort and thus fail, or put too much and overdo it, wasting stamina without need. So, skills that allow you to estimate the DC in any given time are crucial, but when used still give just an estimation, not an exact number.<br/><br/>-On top of that, tactics aren't revealed until acted, which doesn't prevent a tactic from being a feint behind which another tactic hides. It can be done in several layers for added complexity. <br/><br/>Now imagine the next example with the players revealing or switching cards each time you see a word or phrase in <i>italics</i>. These cards have been chosen from each layer's deck before the round. Statuses inflicted are written in <b>bold</b>.<br/><br/>Player A: I lower my <i>guard</i> and look to the right.<br/>GM: Hmm, I was going to <i>charge</i> with my axe but I cancel it and put up my <i>guard</i> instead.<br/>Player B: Ok, since you didn't look you're <b>distracted</b> and I can shoot an arrow from your <i>left flank</i>, right behind the line of trees<br/>GM: That bypasses my guard. Great! Do you use just your strength or put some effort?.<br/>Player B: I'll add 1 point of stamina.<br/>GM: Ok, you strike but the arrow just gets stuck on the opponent's soulder pad.<br/>Player A: Hmm, let me try. Since he's <b>distracted</b> by the arrow attack I charge and hit his weapon to lower his guard. I'll add four stamina points.<br/>GM ok, you hit and disarm him.<br/>Player B: I think you used too much, but at least this is going to end quick. I shoot again, he's distracted by that new attack and has no guard. I'll take time enough to <i>aim</i> at his head.<br/>GM: The oponent goes to player's A <i>left flank</i> to get<b> cover</b><br/>Player A: But he's still unguarded and has no cover against me, so I <i>aim</i> to strike his leg<br/>GM: ok, he<b> falls down</b> and rolls to put some space between you two. He still has cover.<br/>Player B: I change my <i>aim</i> to his other leg or whatever I can see through the cover<br/>GM: you can see his other leg, he's trying to pull a knife from his boot. You shoot him on the leg.<br/>Player A: That went too close, does that distract me?<br/>GM: yes, he's got a knife now, but can't stand properly with his two legs wounded<br/>Player A: I step aside for player B to shoot<br/>Player B: He can't move too fast and has no cover, I take my time to aim at his head and shoot.<br/>GM: your arrow strikes through his eye as he screams in pain, then he falls on his back.<br/>Player A: Ok, I check he's dead and then I loot him.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453372/#Comment_453372" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-19T06:43:04+00:00" title="May 19, 2016  6:43AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Catching up!\n<blockquote>I think it's crucial that we recognise that it's the GM having some criteria of judgement that's important here.</blockquote>I'm actually not sold at all that the judgment must be in the GM's hands, but yes, whoever is judging needs some solid criteria.  <br/><br/>For my particular example in this thread, the criteria is probably "how would that work out in the fiction?" with a lot of particular factors feeding into that analysis like surprise, gravity, awkwardness, difficulty, etc.  I think it's probably okay to admit fallibility on this front (does anyone at the table <i>really</i> know what'd work here?) and fill in the blanks with a bit of extra love for neat or colorful ideas.<br/><br/>Within "how would that work out?", I think we have tons of room for diverse implementations, including, perhaps, how we apportion judgment between rules, GM, acting player, audience, and full group.\n<blockquote>First idea that hit me is <i>States</i>; a hit happens when your character is in a state like "ready" or "attacking" and your opponent is in another or a combination of others, like "blinded", "Guard down", "off balance", "distracted". You would definitely need to impose more than one state in you opponent to kill him and you will need to be in more than one state to be able to hit properly at a vital point, so that's where brilliant tactics come in play. The rest of the space between the attacker state and the defender state and how you switch from attacking to defending should be more or less left to negotiating in the fiction, perhaps with a resource like "stamina" to back up the negotiation.</blockquote>Yeah, that strikes me as a useful re-framing of advantages like "high ground" or whatnot.  Rather than modifying an action that's fundamentally about attributes or weapon skills or whatnot, positioning could really be the whole deal.  Perhaps there could be different intersections of states which confer different options going forward.  For example, let's say I render an opponent "dazed".  If "dazed" plus "trapped" equals "dead" on the States Matrix, then I have an incentive to push my enemy into a corner before he recovers.  But if he's too far from a corner, that's a risky play, as he may come un-dazed first.  So I may take the safer, but less rewarding option, and go for "lined up" (i.e. for a good skewering), because "dazed" plus "lined up" on the States Matrix equals "badly injured", and "badly injured" imposes severe penalties on my foe going forward.<br/><br/>Wait, crap, am I designing a board game?  Is the narration of how I trap my foe or line him up for a hit going to feel clever, or is it just going to feel like reading the rules, picking the best option, and making it so?  Probably the latter.  Gehn.<br/><br/>Maybe your less elaborate suggestion was better.  Maybe it's just "more good States is better" and then you try to narrate in such a way as to maximize the rules-noted categories that fit.  Or maybe not, because in <i>that</i> case, you get that awkward moment where the player does something in the fiction, and no one sees its utility, and then the players says, "I'm going for Distracted!" and then the other players kinda grudgingly see it, but it comes off as begging, not cleverness.<br/><br/>Hey, wait, maybe the acting player isn't allowed to invoke any mechanics?  Maybe they just narrate, and then stop, and when they stop, the other players go over it and judge (based on solid criteria like "how would that work out?") what categories of advantage it comprises?  Oh, and also, what categories of disadvantage!<br/><br/>That might be the key, right there.  There's no penalty to failed attempts to rope in Dogs Traits or BW Wises that don't really apply; worst that can happen is someone at the table says, "I don't buy it, stop begging."  But if a narration simply <i>stands</i>, for good <i>and</i> for bad, then the acting player probably has to use the same criteria as the judging players (e.g. "how would that work out?").<br/><br/>Maybe there could be multiple axes of resolution, so an idea isn't simply good, mediocre, or bad.  There could be, for example, Risk and Reward.  So the best idea is low-Risk, high-Reward... but high-Risk, high-Reward might be okay too, depending on what the acting player prioritizes.<br/><br/>I can see myself, as another player at the table, asking myself, "How risky was that?" and "How rewarding would that be if it worked?" and "How likely is it to work?" and maybe spitting out a number from 1 to 3 (or 0 to 3, or 1 to 5) for each.  Or, I could see going over some criteria like States, and ticking off all that apply, for example:<br/><br/>- Requires exact timing: -2 Likely<br/>- Completely un-practiced: -1 Likely, +1 Risky<br/>- Awkward: +1 Risky<br/>- Exposing vulnerable targets: +1 Risky<br/>- Unexpected by target: +1 Likely, +1 Rewarding<br/>- Extra powerful: +2 Rewarding<br/><br/>The group might ponder my spinning stair jump, deem it all of the above, and determine that my action is extremely Risky (+3), fairly difficult to pull off (-2 Likely), but very Rewarding if I make it (+3).<br/><br/>That sounds like it might get a little slow and tedious to do the ratings, but otherwise I like it.<br/><br/>Thanks for bearing with the brainstorming!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453373/#Comment_453373" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-19T07:02:04+00:00" title="May 19, 2016  7:02AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2016 7:28AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>precise weapon range/reach . . . miss only if the enemy dodges (which would, say, reduce stamina) but otherwise the opponent has to block (which can only be done with the proper weapon, right footing and right amount of str) . . . damage is somewhat fixed, but influenced by the states the character are in</blockquote>Yeah, now we're <i>really</i> thinking in board game terms.  Unlike my States Matrix example, though, it's a challenging enough board game that success genuinely does require cleverness!  I like it... but I don't think checking off the right rules boxes to get the optimal result is what I'm looking for here.\n<blockquote>you may also be interested in Beast Hunters . . .

So the GM is judging subjectively, but also performing calculations?  Can you describe that further?  Is it simply a matter of "given that the character is X good at this sort of thing, success is Y likely"?  Is that determined across multiple bases at once?  Is "awesome" an alternative criteria to "likely" or an additional one?<br/><br/>I seem to recall the Finnish FLOW system functioning somewhat similarly, but that was described to me as being quick.  I think there are two categories representing two components of "would that work?" and the GM subjectively rates both (with no reference to character stats) and then multiplies them together for an outcome.\n<blockquote>there should be some sort of bet: you may or may not have guessed correctly your opponent's tactic, so it should be defined, but remain hidden until acted</blockquote>With predetermined action categories and category interactions, we basically have the Fight! system from Burning Wheel.  In a more freeform setting, though, I do like factoring in some guessing at what the opponent will do, so as to reward unexpected moves.<br/><br/>So maybe as I'm just starting to cook up my spinning stair-jump, the GM secretly writes down the NPC's expectation.  It'll probably be something mundane and irrelevant, so no impact... but if I've been doing this move before, or have made a habit of doing crazy acrobatic attacks, the GM might just guess "spinning stair jump", and if so, give me a massive penalty.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>. . . putting an effort to it.

How about this:<br/><br/>The gm frames the challenge and prepares his bet in secret. Then the player states his action. All the rest are trying to spot anything that the player says that can be turned into an advantage, whenever they do, they move a token from a communal pile to the player's side. The GM and the players are also trying to spot anything that could be considered an additional risk, when they do, one token is moved from the communal pile to the GM's side. This will add to the GM bet.<br/><br/>Next the player guesses if that's enough to beat the GM's bet and can add tokens from his personal pile of Stamina (recharged after a rest). <br/><br/>Then, the GM reveals his bet, higher one wins narrative rights or just things get done. If the player took any risks and won, the pool of tokens in front of the GM go back to the communal pile, if not the player gets as much consequences/fallout as tokens are in that pile.<br/><br/>This way you can still overdo and waste resources or not make enough and still don't suffer immediate consequences; or risk immediate consequences and gain an advantage from it. Clever ideas can be rewarded better (The GM can add more tokens to the player's pile for a particularily clever one, and maybe players themselves can share another token from their personal pile too)<br/><br/>You can also have players make their bet in secret too and have the GM on edge about resources. The main thing is that this way it wouldn't be just about the resources, but about doing anything smart to preserve them or take risks to earn more.<br/><br/>Oh, and you could take out states or pre-written advantages from the mechanics, this way the boardgamey feel can be greatly reduced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Problems with Assets/Advantages - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20617/problems-with-assets-advantages/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Problems with Assets/Advantages - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20617/problems-with-assets-advantages/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content='@WarriorMonk, that sounds cool!

Or, I could see going over some criteria like States, and ticking off all that apply, for example:<br/><br/>- Requires exact timing: -2 Likely<br/>- Completely un-practiced: -1 Likely, +1 Risky<br/>- Awkward: +1 Risky<br/>- Exposing vulnerable targets: +1 Risky<br/>- Unexpected by target: +1 Likely, +1 Rewarding<br/>- Extra powerful: +2 Rewarding<br/><br/>The group might ponder my spinning stair jump, deem it all of the above, and determine that my action is extremely Risky (+3), fairly difficult to pull off (-2 Likely), but very Rewarding if I make it (+3).<br/><br/>That sounds like it might get a little slow and tedious to do the ratings, but otherwise I like it.</blockquote>\nI like it too. It moves the judgment from "how likely" to much more concrete questions. Now just apportion responsibility for each category to different people to parallelize? You could even add some randomness to head off the gamey...<br/><br/>Begin each session by each player pulling a couple of cards from a deck. Keep the cards secret. Players are responsible for judging the aspects they pulled. Not all aspects will be pulled. You draw "be precise to hit a weak point" and "extra powerful". I draw "completely unpracticed" and "unexpected by target".<br/><br/>Your action is "I spend the next 15 minutes judging the exact shot necessary to hit the mechanism holding up the grate so it lands amidst the guards and we can attack with complete surprise."<br/><br/>Thinking to yourself, you judge "be precise" -1 Likely, +1 Rewarding. I judge "completely unpracticed" -1 Likely, +1 Risky because we all know you bought that crossbow a couple weeks ago and "unexpected by target" +1 Likely, +1 Rewarding.<br/><br/>In parallel we decide this then you're ready to roll and ask "Likely?" and hold up -1 finger and I hold up 0. You roll. On failure, "Risky?" and hold up 0 fingers and I hold up 1 and you take +1 Risky damage. On success, "Rewarding?" and hold up 1 finger and I hold up 1 finger and you gain +2 Rewarding meeples.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453409/#Comment_453409" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-20T16:23:54+00:00" title="May 20, 2016  4:23PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>, that sounds cool!

Mostly the GM's bet should be assembled considering the scenario (up to some limits) and adding a personal bet of probably up to 3 tokens. There should be a few more guidelines here so it shouldn't be like we're again leaving everything to GM fiat, that would be a step back. Yet it's in secret because players don't know everything. <br/><br/>Now that I think more in this, perhaps this could help a lot to model some of the actions the players could take to gain more information to better asess risks and challenges. Like, sucessfully scouting could make the GM to either show how much tokens he will invest into the whole scene, or make him made more and more of his bet into the open (though not completely). The GM could say "ok, you know now that there's an ogre behind the door ready to attack anybody who crosses it", and then put four tokens in front of him, so players know now that they will need at least 4 tokens if they want to kick the door and attack, perhaps one or three more depending on how invested is the GM on this or how many resources he wants to make them burn.However players can still plan carefully and try to smoke out the ogre, taunt him to come out, etc. All this will increase their bet. with tokens from the common pool.<br/><br/>Personally I like to have and handle physical tokens instead of adding and resting numbers in my head or on paper, but perhaps that's just a personal preference; space abstraction and visual inputs never interfere with my immersion anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453421/#Comment_453421" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-20T22:20:46+00:00" title="May 20, 2016 10:20PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, when the characters uncover info about difficulty or obstacle, plopping down tokens that represent the discovered truth is great!<br/><br/>I don't really like a knowable GM budget, though.  Like, if the players know the GM gets 7 for the scene, and they've used 5 already, then the next encounter is easy.  An unknowable budget might work, though, where the amount of tokens the GM has to work with gets adjusted by stuff the characters do or other developments in the fiction.  Start with 7, but take more each time the players opt against the safest path or something.\n<blockquote>Mostly the GM's bet should be assembled considering the scenario (up to some limits) and adding a personal bet of probably up to 3 tokens.

With the stair jump, is it mostly about the capability of the NPC enemy?  Lots of tokens for a boss, few for a mook?  Or is it more about the specific moment the PC is responding to -- "the NPC chases you up the stairs", for example?<br/><br/>The thing that seems most obvious to me is to use GM tokens mainly to represent difficulty, either:<br/>A) insofar as difficulty can be assessed <i>before</i> the player announces an action (after it's announced, people might push tokens toward the GM if the announced action sounds hard), or<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> after the player has announced their action, judged secretly by the GM (with any tokens passed relating only to risk, not difficulty)<br/><br/>And then the GM has a "because I feel like it!" budget, representing beyond-normal resistance to the PCs, in the form of determined NPC opposition or environmental obstacles etc.<br/><br/>But there are plenty of downsides in there, so I'm wondering if you have any better ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453423/#Comment_453423" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-20T23:24:08+00:00" title="May 20, 2016 11:24PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2016 11:28PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Now just apportion responsibility for each category to different people to parallelize?

A judgment task for everyone might help keep everyone actively attending to the fiction, hopefully without handing any one player enough specific foci to drown out the overall experience.  A bit of a balancing act -- some players might still find it too GMly for their taste -- but I'm optimistic!<br/><br/>Randomized factors is clever, and I love the way it counters checkbox predictability.  I'm not sure, though, if giving people whatever responsibilities they drew from a deck is as much fun as giving them whatever responsibilities they're eager to perform.<br/><br/>I'm also not sure whether factor uncertainty is worth it -- I'd consider it a shame if a character did something totally unexpected by the enemy, but a card not drawn determined "nope, we don't care about surprise today".<br/><br/>Diminishing returns and "not important enough to bother with" are certainly issues in favor of omitting some factors, but I might prefer to try to find the optimal factors list and just stick with it.<br/><br/>Or maybe something in between?  Maybe certain factors are fixed concerns, and certain duties are wedded to certain participants, but then there's a customizable layer beyond that?  More minute concerns that everyone agrees are relevant in a specific scenario, or someone's in the mood to attend to them, or whatnot.<br/><br/>As for each player doing the math on each variable and calling out "+1" or whatever when needed, that's beautifully efficient, but I think a <i>little</i> more communication is required for acting players to match consequences to actions.  "+1 -- precise, but unpracticed!" is probably better.<br/><br/>As for the order of <i>(1) Likely? (2) Roll (3) resolve Risk (4) on success, resolve Reward</i>, that's exactly what I was thinking!  Not sure about resolving Risk only on failed rolls, though.  You can successfully skewer a dude while jumping down some stairs <i>and</i> sprain your ankle.  Maybe roll a d6, result \u2264 Risk level means trouble?  So with 0 Risk there's no roll, but otherwise there is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453537/#Comment_453537" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-24T19:50:10+00:00" title="May 24, 2016  7:50PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, what about this:<br/><br/>-The players have a limited budget made up of their personal resources, the GM doesn't have a budget, but a fixed, per-session pool of his personal investment tokens; and also has guidelines about how much he can normally bet per conflict.<br/><br/>-So, in game, you all reach a point where you need to negotiate something. The player can offer to buy out a favorable resolution with resources, the GM can take it or not. If he doesn't we come to the bet part.<br/><br/>-The GM secretly states his bet, defined by the amount of advantages on his behalf. If players are aware of any of these advantages he has to show that amount of tokens from his bet. <br/><br/>-Now the player states her bet. Whoever is giving any kind of support to that player can add up to three tokens fro their personal pool. The rest of the players pull each a card to asess an specific risk and the the GM pulls one or more cards until the amount of cards pulled are equal to the amount of players.  The player bet is modified.<br/><br/>-Finally, the GM and the player get to add tokens from their personal investment pools in secret, if they want, and both reveal at the same time to compare.<br/><br/>Well, it's still kinda crude and there are lots of things missing but I think that's more or less how it could be done. Perhaps the bet part still needs more sim plification. There should also be the chance for players taking <i>fallout</i> tokens instead of making the bet, like admitting the GM got them this time so they take a wound, instead of wating resources in a bet that they don't consider too important.<br/><br/>Also, the idea of having players assess the risk is good, limiting it by cards sounds better, but still players will be tempted to be partial to the player whenever stakes are high. I think that's okey and that's why I introduced that part about the GM drawing cards for each player who isn't assessing the risk already, so he will have at least one saying on the matter to balance things.<br/><br/>I also thought of a different approach, using a d6. Player proposes his action and will get it done if he rolls a six. But each advantage reduces the difficulty by one, as well as risking things. However, whenever he adds a risk, this happens if he rolls a one. The GM can negotiate to add risks too. You could have a top of 3 risks to reduce the difficulty to 3+ (meaning that if you roll a 3 you get what you want but you still get one unfavorable consequence related to one of the risks. The player could also chose to take fallout to reduce the difficulty, like, accepting to take damage to deal damage to his opponent. <br/><br/>The thing is, pile up enough advantages and you don't need to roll the dice. Negotiate or take fallout and you don't need to roll the dice. You can even do more than one thing: take a risk and some fallout and you get what you want. Or even try doing things by sheer luck, it's up to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy" title="chaiboy"><img alt="chaiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/368/nWWEJX1TT1UNK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy">chaiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453540/#Comment_453540" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-25T01:33:20+00:00" title="May 25, 2016  1:33AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the system would need to use moves instead of turns so that you can have a run up the stairs and spin to knock them down the stairs. You want a system that lets players do multiple things and make a single roll for the entire event instead of roll to create aspect "stairs" then roll to kick the guy down the stairs etc...<br/><br/>I could see a system that uses some kind of aspect for various items in the game. So attacker's armor has the aspect: Heavy armor resistant to weapon quality 4 or less. So the defender's dagger with quality 2 isn't going to work. The player decides his character races up the stairs and at the last moment spins and tackles the attacker. <br/><br/>So you could have a type of action/move that lets the player use a different stat or aspect and if it succeeds it bypasses a single aspect that the opponent has. So, in this case, he uses his agility to beat the strength based armor aspect. On a success it ignores the armor and the attacker falls down the stairs with the dagger in a gap between the plates.<br/><br/>I wrote a system for a game that lets characters use any stat to beat their opponent. It is the same kind of idea. Someone draws a pistol and The Doctor talks his way out of it.

There was no reason to balance stats. What I was describing was the idea of a character taking an action and then applying the rules to it. Rules were secondary. I always error on the side of the player. I think there was a GM that had the rule of cool, I always played by that idea. If the player came up with something they wanted to try and it wasn't ridiculous then they roll and let the dice decide.<br/><br/><br/>Now in relation to the original question, I don't think it needs a whole new system. I play D&amp;D now and we ask to do some ridiculous things in it. The GM just lets us roll and works out the results on the fly. <br/><br/>To code that kind of interaction into the rules would just require add moves the embrace taking advantage automatically into the rules so the rogue can do a flying tackle, throw dirt or toss his hot tea into the knight's face. It should all work the same.<br/><br/>So for Fate just make a new action called Surprise! and if it succeeds it bypasses the defense aspect they were trying to use. Maybe it does less damage but puts an aspect on the target such as fallen and can't get up or face is boiling.<br/><br/>But the act of being chased and reacting is more of how the turn flows more than anything.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World might work much better for this kind of system since both parties act together. So same situation and then the player rolls on a 10+ he rides the knight down the stairs into the wall. On 7-9 he lands on him and they both tumble down the stairs. On 6- the knight ducks and the rogue flys over the knight's head to tumble down the stairs. That kind of resolution is already built into Apocalypse world so not sure if it really requires a whole new move. I haven't dug into the system enough to know more.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453548/#Comment_453548" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-25T16:44:37+00:00" title="May 25, 2016  4:44PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree about the turns, though I think we discussed that part before... and yes, initiative would go to the first who has an idea/is closer/makes sense, then you can proceed with the next person clockwise unless the previous action puts another player on the spotlight or someone else has an idea. <br/><br/>However that works because the GM only does any move at all when the players fail their roll, which is when he gets to present new threats or apply the consequences of previous ones. Having the GM act once everyone has acted may work, though it could breake immersion a bit until the players are used to it.<br/><br/>I agree that one skill games can perfectly work, as they act more like limiting the character to a theme, lika a class. However, it makes more sense that instead of having bonuses that stack and rise as you level up, you should get new specializations and other abilities related (like D&amp;D class abilities)<br/><br/>What I'm trying right now is to give players specializations that transform how other of his skills work. For example, you could have a skill on "armor use" that limits the amount of protection you can use. Normally the monk wouldn't level up that skill at all and instead put all his points to martial arts, but at certain level of martial arts he can acquire "ki armor", which enables him to use his ki to protect him like an armour. So, instead of using the bonus in "martial arts" to define the amount of protection or generate another skill, the monk can put bonuses on "armor use" which now has the specialization "ki armor". <br/><br/>Mechanically this solution works in the same way, doesn't require more space in the character sheet, doesn't create a potential problem where normal armor could stack with ki armor and now the player isn't actually breaking the game using the same skill to do everything; he just gets access to new ways to solve problems by using different versions of the same skills.<br/><br/>Another example could be the illusionist magician using an invisibility spell, which is now an specialization of his stealth, or every pc rolling for a different version of intimidate, more in tune with his personal skillset... but I'm derrailing the thread so I'll stop there.<br/><br/>Btw, what David is trying to do is mostly a system that doesn't require rolls nor other randomization or at least rarely uses them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453609/#Comment_453609" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-28T20:13:36+00:00" title="May 28, 2016  8:13PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not against random rolls or whatnot popping up somewhere in the process, but I definitely don't want them subbing in for the tactical weight of choices.

Perhaps the bet part still needs more simplification.</blockquote>I really like the part where risk elements that are known and unknown to the players manifest as public and secret GM token plays.  I could see secret GM tokens simply being dictated by the fiction as the GM envisions it, but perhaps that could be codified in prep/planning, which would enable some balancing (hard vs easy, obvious vs hidden) if desired.<br/><br/>So, as a player, I narrate my action that I think is clever, and then we as a group establish some stuff that everyone agrees on, covering known risks and advantages and disadvantages, with either fixed (lists) or variable (cards) directing us where to look for such things.  This gives us the known factors.  Then the GM secretly adds tokens for unknown factors, based either on their previous prep or on their momentary inspiration (possibly constrained by some sort of budget or cap), and I secretly add tokens for how much of my finite effort/energy pool I'm using on this action.  Then we reveal, and compare totals, and this comparison somehow tells us yes/no, degree of success or degree of failure, and consequences independent of success/failure (e.g. certain risks).<br/><br/>I think this sounds fun!  As pertains to my goal with this thread, I think the "agree on factors" part is the key, but it's definitely nice to imagine that functioning inside this fuller system you're coming up with.<br/><br/>I'd definitely ditch all balancing concerns from that system, though, beyond perhaps "GM, don't make <i>everything</i> hard, or easy, or obvious, or secret."  Every piece of "well I have tokens so I'll add them" or "I don't have tokens so I can't do what I want" or "that card didn't come up so this factor doesn't matter now" or "I don't want you to get maimed so I'll pretend to like your idea more than I do" or "I want to defeat the players" just gets in the way of a clear connection between my choice of action and my fate.  I want my decision to be judged on its own merits as much as possible, and for those merits to determine my fate as much as possible.  Otherwise, there's no such thing as a clever idea, just more or less popular ones.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to bash other approaches!  I think a game with totally player-level (as opposed to fiction-level) bonus/penalty/risk judgment criteria could also be super fun!  We could even go so far as to replace criteria like "powerful" or "risky" with criteria like "funny" or "inventive" or "repeating motif" or "perfect for the situation" or maybe even desired impacts like "creepy" or "heartfelt" or "gross"!  It's just not what I'm looking for right now.  Right now I'd like the most objective take we can get on whether my clever idea was risky and powerful (etc.) or it wasn't, and for me to prosper or suffer accordingly.\n<blockquote>I also thought of a different approach, using a d6.

Putting myself more and more out there renders failure more catastrophic, while allowing odds of success to be adjusted independently.  I like it!\n<blockquote>The player could also chose to take fallout to reduce the difficulty, like, accepting to take damage to deal damage to his opponent.</blockquote>If this can be mapped to a character action, I like it!  Otherwise, I don't.  My first thought would be to cover it before any judging of my action begins.  Either, "I am trying to stay on-balance so I don't face-plant; if that means that I miss the best moment to skewer him, then so be it," or "I am going to press for the perfect opening for as long as it takes, and if that ends with me face-planting as I skewer him, then so be it."  And then whoever's judging me would find that represented in relevant categories like "cautious" or "fanatical" or something.<br/><br/>Huh, interesting, now that I've given those examples, I realize that I do that a lot when I play -- spelling out which of two poles I'm prioritizing in an action.  Maybe this system could offer some efficient ritual phrase for that, for players who don't want to have to remember or re-conceive it each time.  "Caution over success" and "success over caution" or something like that?\n<blockquote>The thing is, pile up enough advantages and you don't need to roll the dice. Negotiate or take fallout and you don't need to roll the dice. You can even do more than one thing: take a risk and some fallout and you get what you want. Or even try doing things by sheer luck, it's up to you.</blockquote>Again, I wouldn't want to do this via rules decisions, but if the result of my fictional choices is that I will clearly succeed and clearly get hurt, then yeah, why roll dice about it?<br/><br/>Here's a thought: regardless of whether we use a token compare or adjustments to a die roll, there's a threshold at which it's randomized, above and below which it's deterministic.  So, like, if the player out-tokens the GM by 3, success; if the GM out-tokens the player by 3, failure; in between, modified roll.  Or, with the d6: penalties of -3 or worse, fail with no roll; bonuses of +3 or better, succeed with no roll; otherwise, roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453708/#Comment_453708" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-01T19:59:35+00:00" title="June  1, 2016  7:59PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If this can be mapped to a character action, I like it!  Otherwise, I don't.  My first thought would be to cover it before any judging of my action begins.  Either, "I am trying to stay on-balance so I don't face-plant; if that means that I miss the best moment to skewer him, then so be it," or "I am going to press for the perfect opening for as long as it takes, and if that ends with me face-planting as I skewer him, then so be it."  And then whoever's judging me would find that represented in relevant categories like "cautious" or "fanatical" or something.<br/><br/>Huh, interesting, now that I've given those examples, I realize that I do that a lot when I play -- spelling out which of two poles I'm prioritizing in an action.  Maybe this system could offer some efficient ritual phrase for that, for players who don't want to have to remember or re-conceive it each time.  "Caution over success" and "success over caution" or something like that?<br/></blockquote>\nExactly! When I thought of the dice approach I purposely kept it simple so it could be easily mapped to the fictional situation. And yes, most of the time tactical decisions will go along the Caution vs. Success axis. trying to spend less resources to get something done will be cautious, while going all out will probably guarantee success but only in the short term. Taking your time now may mean later you will be in a rush. Fighting defensively may help you stay in one piece and tire your adversary, but it may force him to try other approaches or call reinforcements. <br/><br/>You can make tactical choices to introduce facts to the fiction that will help you negotiate an specific outcome or reduce the chances of losing. If those facts point at your character incurring on a risk or spending resources like health, stamina, time, ammunition, etc then it's okey, the caution vs sucess die still covers it and no additional rules are needed. <br/><br/>For example, the GM presents a minotaur as a challenge. I've been able to find a survivor from one of his attacks and now I know some things about the minotaur. I've found a good place to fight it, tracked it sucessfully and taunted him to approach our group's ambush. Not everything could go as expected of course: The GM tells us now that it seems the Minotaur has an armor and a great axe, which didn't seem to had when he attacked the witness group.<br/><br/>So, everyone masks their smell and stay still and silent at the place. It's the ruins of an inn, there's no roof and there are lots of rubble around, enough so the minotaur won't charge easily. We've got a few stone walls and pillars to hide, and the remains of the stairs which give our ranger a vantage point to snipe the monster. I lure the monster to follow me to the ruins and somehow signal everyone that it's armed and armored now.<br/><br/>The minotaur enters the ruins and we go around the table. Everyone can attack from range with impunity, but there's still the armour. It's Surprise against Armour so I'd say everyone hits on a 4-6. The sniper chooses to take his time to hit the next round, on a 3-6. It's the turn for the barbarian and me to lock him in combat and keep him there. I attack right after the volley so I get to keep the 4-6 to hit, but I chose to be cautious and not risk giving him the chance to counter, which he would definitely get if I roll a 1. I take a 5-6 and roll. It's a 3 so no effective hit but no counter neither, the GM narrates how his armour deflects it and now is facing me. The barbarian goes next gambling a risky attack now that it's distracted. On a 1-2 he gets countered but on 3-6 he hits. I yell at the monster to keep him distracted so the GM chooses to reduce the risk by one. The barbarian rolls a 4 and hits and next it's the minotaur's turn.<br/><br/>It has sustained enough damage to make him see all red so instead of looking for cover it swings his axe at both the barbarian and me. I stand in the way with my shield so the barbarian can get out of it easier and state that the hit would definitely break my shoulder armour and wound me but I can still give the barbarian a good chance for a counter. Mechanically that means that I'm taking fallout (part of the armour and some HP) to rise the chances. The GM states that I risk dropping the shield too, so on a 1-2 that happens and the barbarian still has to dodge, while on a 4-6 I give the barbarian a chance to counter.<br/><br/>I roll a 6 so the barbarian attacks. He chooses to jump to add fome force to his blow risking to get too close to the minotaur. So he manages to get a 4-6 to hit, 1 means he will probably get kicked. The counter would naturally come before the sniper attack so the barbarian jumps... and rolls a 1. He's about to get kicked and now only the sniper can do anything. The sniper chooses to wait right after the kick so the minotaur is unbalanced and has less chances to avoid his shot. The barbarian get's kicked and now he can shoot and hit with a 2-6. He chooses to aim at his throat risking to fail and be spotted, which keeps the difficulty the same. Another party member chooses to stand in the open and yell at the monster to keep him distracted, so the GM offers the sniper an automatic success for severely wounding the minotaur or rolling 4-6 to outright kill it. <br/><br/>The ranger feels lucky and chooses to roll. He rolls a 6. The beast falls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453718/#Comment_453718" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-02T16:30:55+00:00" title="June  2, 2016  4:30PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2016 4:32PM by Adam_Dray.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Sorcerer</i> does this neat thing, where the dice and action economy work out so that you can chain together actions, and it becomes multiple rolls where your successes in the early rolls become more dice in subsequent rolls (really, the very next roll following the successes). <br/><br/>There explicitly isn't a "+1 for higher ground" type rule, though (IIRC).

I'd forgotten that.  Why did I forget?  Hmm.  I think it never came up when I played.  Two possible reasons for this:<br/><br/>1) We were resolving intents on a "what really matters here" scale, not on a "subtle momentary advantage" scale.  My group understood that as the intent of the rules at the time.<br/><br/>2) What you roll for in Sorcerer.  That is, you <i>don't</i> roll unless it's a conflict with another person.  So we never got into the sort of spatial positioning and leveraging of tools and whatnot that might require skill checks in other games.<br/><br/>I think I now see some simple solutions, though!  (1) Zoom in on minute actions and (2) parse all positioning attempts as contests.<br/><br/>So, when I decide I want to run up the stairs to position myself for a spin-jump, my opponent declares their intent to run right up my back and knock me over the second I break stride!  Then we resolve which party wins.  If I win, then my success on that action lends dice to my subsequent spin-jump.  I suppose there are two ways to proceed at that point, both interesting:<br/>A) Roll to hurt my opponent as part of the spin-jump-slash (the obvious move, with fewer chances of failure between me and my ultimate goal)<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> If we can <i>stack</i> successes, I could roll for just the spin-jump itself, positioning to perform the slash with even <i>more</i> bonus dice (more risk of achieving nothing, but also more possibility of landing a truly great slash)<br/><br/>If the rules and various opponents dictate that the choice between A and B is interesting, then we could leave that to the player.  Otherwise, we could define what scale rolls operate on, in whatever fashion works best to reward the desired degree of positioning (so as to avoid the situation where "I just roll once to get what I want, because my odds are better that way than if I encounter multiple chances for failure").<br/><br/>As for the cleverness or other virtues of my actions:<br/><br/>- I see one major virtue to chaining minute conflict resolutions, which is that minute actions can be easier to judge.  Can I outrun a guy up some stairs?  Well, that's a simple matter of who's faster.  Can I surprise him as I spin?  Well, that sounds like an issue of reflexes and expectation.  As my opponents state their intents, my risks also become clearer.<br/><br/>- When time comes to judge anything, I'd probably still prefer something more objective than Sorcerer's "bonus die if the action seems like a particularly good one!"  But maybe enough micro "good idea!" judgments leading into one real outcome (how much I slash the guy or fail to) would suffice in practice.  After all, my choice of the arenas of conflict -- first speed, then reflexes -- is objectively clever or not depending on the match-up.<br/><br/>Do I want to reduce all positioning to "play to my strengths and my opponent's weaknesses"?  No.  But I do think it's a worthy element to include, and perhaps some simple additional procedures could cover other positioning elements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453723/#Comment_453723" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-02T23:18:50+00:00" title="June  2, 2016 11:18PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Encoding these systems mechanically is fully leveraging predicate space.<br/>There's nothing inherent in the underlying idea that require losing out in the action economy.<br/><br/>I think there's a couple of things muddled together here though.

Spending one action to set up a +2 and one for attacking can be better than making two attacks. Depending on the other numbers involved.

I've proposed a variety of things, but I think the main hard rule is "judge by what you objectively think would happen in the fiction", and then I've proposed a whole bunch of different ways of turning that into system bits (bonus for this, risk for that, extra roll for those, etc.).  I'm not sure, there are multiple different interesting-sounding systems on the table in this thread!<br/><br/>Immersion and overall experience is kinda outside the range of this thought experiment.  I don't have a specific game I'm building this for (yet, anyway) -- I wanted to leave myself open to various ways of making positioning matter, without restricting the range of possibilities entirely to my usual play tastes.  For the sake of this thread, if the acting player can think in fictional particulars rather than rules entities, than that's immersive and non-boardgamey enough.<br/><br/>My hope is that, if we went with categories like Unexpected and Awkward (etc.), the player wouldn't simply be able to check them off like boxes, the way they can with "I use X trait, and Y skill, and Z feat" in some games.  The boardgamey games define X, Y, and Z such that you can just choose to do them and they happen.  In the game I'm envisioning here, you can certainly try to do something that meets various criteria, but you're working from the fiction, and that's what everyone else is judging.  So you're not allowed to say, "I go with Unexpected for +1!" and then mumble some justification; instead, you announce what you're doing, hoping your foe won't expect it, and then you see if the group judges that to be the case.<br/><br/>There are plenty of procedural unknowns in here, but I don't think boardgaminess should be hard to avoid.\n<blockquote>Surprise against Armour so I'd say everyone hits on a 4-6. The sniper chooses to take his time to hit the next round, on a 3-6. It's the turn for the barbarian and me to lock him in combat and keep him there. I attack right after the volley so I get to keep the 4-6 to hit, but I chose to be cautious and not risk giving him the chance to counter, which he would definitely get if I roll a 1. I take a 5-6 and roll. It's a 3 so no effective hit but no counter neither, the GM narrates how his armour deflects it and now is facing me. The barbarian goes next gambling a risky attack now that it's distracted. On a 1-2 he gets countered but on 3-6 he hits. I yell at the monster to keep him distracted so the GM chooses to reduce the risk by one. The barbarian rolls a 4 and hits and next it's the minotaur's turn.</blockquote>I like this!  A very elegant system for relating risk to pursuit of success.<br/><br/>I don't think that treating all advantage-seeking as successful and treating all advantages as equal would reward the sort of specifics-from-the-fiction thought I'm pursuing here.  So, something to separate underwhelming efforts from brilliant ones would be nice.  But perhaps the foundation for that is already in place.\n<blockquote>I stand in the way with my shield so the barbarian can get out of it easier and state that the hit would definitely break my shoulder armour and wound me but I can still give the barbarian a good chance for a counter. Mechanically that means that I'm taking fallout (part of the armour and some HP) to rise the chances.</blockquote>With a few different versions of advantage and disadvantage and risk to play with, maybe we have a broad enough set of mechanical options to describe any particular action scenario.  If I execute my stair-jump-spin-slash in convincing fashion, maybe the judgment of the group or GM will give me lots of advantage and only moderate risk, whereas if I try that move with a clumsy character against a slick opponent on a really narrow staircase, I might be judged to earn no advantage and incur lots of risk.<br/><br/>That sounds fun to me!  "You narrated one act of advantage-seeking, so you get +1 on the roll" does not, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453733/#Comment_453733" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-03T23:24:41+00:00" title="June  3, 2016 11:24PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2016 12:08AM by David_Berg.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>my choice of the arenas of conflict -- first speed, then reflexes -- is objectively clever or not depending on the match-up.<br/><br/>Do I want to reduce all positioning to "play to my strengths and my opponent's weaknesses"?

Could there be ad-libbed comparisons?  So rather than an Asset just having a value (+2 or whatever), it could also have a specific interface (+1 against enemy's shield if the group/GM determines that's what makes sense).  This could work even if we don't have rules or stats for shields -- once the shield's been established in the fiction, we figure out what's opposing it and arbitrate that conflict accordingly.  This could be done <i>Sorcerer</i>-style, with the shield as a mod to my opponent's dice pool and my hard attack as a mod to mine, or as a direct shield vs sword thing to see if either breaks, or as something in between.<br/><br/>I also wonder if including some hidden info here might be fun: Do you start a contest against your enemy's agility, which you know is good but not great, or test their strength, which you don't know at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453736/#Comment_453736" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-04T02:38:59+00:00" title="June  4, 2016  2:38AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2016 2:42AM by Paul_T.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second the Sorcerer/Shadow of Yesterday-style linked rolls for success. That's a pretty robust technology, because it's naturally somewhat self-limiting (hard to "break") but also allows us to inject judgement (in the form of bonus dice, or setting difficulty, or whatever other variable) to sway outcomes.<br/><br/>Dave, I mentioned at some point (first page of the thread) a checklist-style list of possible factors, and some limiting factor for "borderline" outcomes.<br/><br/>It could be things like this:<br/><br/>* The opposition is completely unprepared for this action/it catches them by surprise. <br/>* Your action increases your own personal risk.<br/>* Your action has the potential to deliver results beyond the usual expectations.<br/>* Your action may leave you at a disadvantage.<br/>* Your action will take extra time.<br/>* Your action may create an advantage for you (or an ally).<br/><br/>When you try something, we go down the list and see which apply. Your spinning, leaping stab from the stairs certainly increases your personal risk, but also has the potential to deliver results beyond expectation (puncturing the armour). To determine the others, like whether the opposition is surprised and whether it may leave you at a disadvantage, we need to nail down more specifics about the fiction and how you're doing this thing.<br/><br/>These take the place of modifiers, each having some impact on resolution. I'm not sure exactly how those would work, but perhaps for each category the GM could either place a token (this is guaranteed) or a die (you must match this number to get this benefit/avoid this disadvantage). <br/><br/>The idea is that the system is pure fiction-judgement, once we have the categories.<br/><br/>In a simpler version, it could be something like an AW move: on a partial hit, you get one of these factors in your favour (do you puncture the armour but end up at a disadvantage?), but on a dramatic success you get them all (you puncture the armour AND you're not at a disadvantage!).<br/><br/>The idea, though, is that instead of moving a difficulty number up and down, we are talking about possible consequences. Yes, that part could achieve that effect ("You've got both hands on the knife and you're leaping down? Sure, that sounds like it could pierce the armour..."), no, that won't take extra time.<br/><br/>If the list of factors is interesting enough while still being short enough, I could see it being superior to pure freeform (with possible occasional moments of Rule Zero to bend the rules to fit unusual circumstances, or simply a "________ [some other advantage]" entry on the list).<br/><br/>The resolution rules themselves could play with this in different ways, like a bad roll or low bid introducing a new problem, but a good one allowing you to avoid a possible danger/drawback. In our example, you might need to compare stats or roll dice to see if you caught your opponent unawares, for instance. On the other hand, we might agree that the maneuver definitely WILL puncture the armour (e.g. it's thin chain mail), and take that off the table as far as resolution is concerned.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453743/#Comment_453743" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-04T18:33:41+00:00" title="June  4, 2016  6:33PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great ideas!  A good enough and short enough checklist might allow us to go "yes, no, maybe?" for each one.  For each "maybe" we then have a simple resolution.  For each "yes" we then have some sort of simple outcome determination.  Possibly, "GM, pick from this list whichever applies".<br/><br/>Perhaps there could occasionally be a "maybe" which highlights something particularly consequential or dramatic and then the group would be down with a less simple resolution there.  Not sure.  I can imagine that there would be fictional actions which would captivate the whole group as we worked through them in 7 protracted steps, but my spinning stair jump stab is probably more of a "3 quick steps" kind of deal.<br/><br/>Random thought: I like it when a completed action's results are mostly what you would expect, most of the time, but not entirely, all of the time.  So "what makes sense to the GM/group, based on the fiction" can be most of the story, but maybe shouldn't be the whole story.  Maybe one final flip of the d6, with 6 being "and" and 1 being "but" and then the GM can fill those in with random inspiration for unlikely outcomes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453750/#Comment_453750" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-06T15:42:42+00:00" title="June  6, 2016  3:42PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that kind of thing, too.

On an unusually bad roll, we add something bad.<br/><br/>On a "critical" roll, though, we go beyond that to something totally unexpected.<br/><br/>The downside, of course, is that the dice tend to help very little in terms of running the game - used this way, as a minor oracle, you don't get a whole lot of support from the system in terms of pushing play along.

Mostly because hardcoding assets and advantage values and relating them to specific results in specific cases sounds boardgamey to me sometimes, but if the main hard rule is "judge by what you objectively think would happen in the fiction" then that's ok.\n<blockquote><br/>My hope is that, if we went with categories like Unexpected and Awkward (etc.), the player wouldn't simply be able to check them off like boxes, the way they can with "I use X trait, and Y skill, and Z feat" in some games.  The boardgamey games define X, Y, and Z such that you can just choose to do them and they happen.  In the game I'm envisioning here, you can certainly try to do something that meets various criteria, but you're working from the fiction, and that's what everyone else is judging.  So you're not allowed to say, "I go with Unexpected for +1!" and then mumble some justification; instead, you announce what you're doing, hoping your foe won't expect it, and then you see if the group judges that to be the case.<br/><br/>There are plenty of procedural unknowns in here, but I don't think boardgaminess should be hard to avoid.<br/></blockquote>\nExcellent, I like it that you either do enough for the GM and the group considering your action into one category or not, no +1's. It doesn't feel as boardgamey as I thought anyway. Then depending on which category was triggered the GM narrates what would normally happen, though the player still gets to roll a dice to determine if something unexpected happens, either good or bad.<br/><br/>Applying this to my example greatly reduces the waiting time for the sniper: he is hiding and the rest of PCs are distracting the target and keeping it in one place, so definitely he will hit; waiting additional turns adds nothing and on a 6 he gets a headshot, on a 1 he gets a mad wounded minotaur charging against him. II like it better not having a player sitting, waiting the whole battle for nothing but a chance of doing damage.<br/><br/>Also, for the PCs attacking to distract the target, they just do. We assume they are doing it defensively or GM can rule they have to state it or risk a counter. On a 6 they also make some damage, on a 1 they get swept and the minotaur goes for the next target, or they get wounded.<br/><br/>For negotiating around the table what could be considered logical setting wise, I dunno, I would prefer to have the GM vote count as 49% of the total, so if just a single other player agrees with him, they go with the GM's interpretation, though I'm just proposing that to reduce the discussion time. It's not a middle ground between GM fiat and democracy, it's totally unbalanced to the former's side just for the sake of speed, but it still gives players a chance to stop the GM in his tracks if needed. I'm thinking of both of the worst possible cases here instead of the best one, and hoping this doesn't disrupt play for the best cases, but is a wild guess.\n<blockquote><br/>With a few different versions of advantage and disadvantage and risk to play with, maybe we have a broad enough set of mechanical options to describe any particular action scenario.  If I execute my stair-jump-spin-slash in convincing fashion, maybe the judgment of the group or GM will give me lots of advantage and only moderate risk, whereas if I try that move with a clumsy character against a slick opponent on a really narrow staircase, I might be judged to earn no advantage and incur lots of risk.<br/>.</blockquote>\nMapping categories into moves could give us something like this perhaps:<br/><br/><b>Unexpected:</b> situation and/or player's choices allow their character to catch their opponent unprepared. On your judgement (confirmed by the players) give the player one, two or three of the next:<br/>-You can take a moment to aim a more precise attack<br/>-You can make a (noticeable) movement before your opponent has a chance to react<br/>-You can make a (noticeable) action before your opponent has a chance to react<br/><br/><b>Risky:</b> situation or player's choices make their character face a dangerous situation from which they have little chance to come out unscathed. On your judgement (confirmed by the players) present them one, two or three of the next possible consequences:<br/>-You get wounded<br/>-Your equipment is damaged (whatever piece of equipment makes sense)<br/>-You lose time and/or a chance to do something else<br/>-You end up in a disadvantageous position (prone, trapped, flanked, etc)<br/><br/>I'm specifically trying to leave optimal/sub-optimal cases to the critical/fumble die btw. Also, this moves are meant for the GM only, that's why they are phrased like that. Though I've doubts about it since these categories should apply to the NPCs and monster too at some point.

I'll call them Approaches.</blockquote>\nThe current conceptual model I'm using is 'Concerns' because it allows me to define actions, priorities, interpretations, and values in the same semantic 'chunk'. And what's important is like Moves and Approaches they determine the point at which uncertainty enters an action sequence.\n<blockquote>I also think we need outcomes with specific mechanical teeth.</blockquote>\nThe only mechanical teeth I care about are those which constrain/expand the choices available to the players. And I want some of those choices to have a lasting effect on the character.\n<blockquote>So we resolve multiple things at once.</blockquote>\nBut what exactly constitutes 'multiple things'?<br/><br/>Most RPGs demarcate hitting your opponent from damaging your opponent even when they allow one to affect the other. And killing your opponent is not a task you can attempt, but a consequence of damaging them enough.<br/><br/>This is not the only way to divide things however, and the game will change depending on where you draw the line. But divide we must, because otherwise we get toothless skills with ambiguous outcomes, no clear end or beginning, and resolve in a single roll.\n<blockquote>I use the dice both as a way to define if an action resolves positively or negatively</blockquote>\nBut what exactly constitutes 'positive' and 'negative'?<br/><br/>Without knowing the player's priorities there's no way to tell, which is another reason I like the Concerns model. More importantly it allows me to model actions where the choice is what matters. For example, a character might attempt to 'serve the empire' and 'protect the innocent' in the same action, but only be able to achieve one. But is that a positive or negative outcome?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454080/#Comment_454080" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T19:27:35+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  7:27PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2016 7:27PM by WarriorMonk.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, it looks more simple if you step a bit further: positive means the player gets what she wants, negative means their approach is blocked.

And many RPGs don't treat a negative result simply as a failure to achieve an intent, but as something <i>detrimental to the character</i>, which gets very ambiguous in cases where simply taking damage doesn't make sense. Finally, what if they get exactly what they want, <i>but not in the way they intended</i>? So maybe they get away from the mob by accidentally setting an orphanage on fire. But is that a negative result? It all depends on the player and the character they're playing.<br/><br/>Positive and Negative frame things in terms of Good and Bad as opposed to <i>just what makes sense in the fiction</i>, which means you need to know <i>what they want</i> as well as <i>what they expect</i> in order to resolve an action.

Now that you mention it in relation to the thread title, it occurs to me that Assets could be made way more interesting by tagging them with Risks or Conditions or something.  So, like, use this Asset to get a +2, but when you do, spend 3 energy points, or roll on the meltdown table, or choose an Aggressive fighting stance, or sign a pact with a demon, or become Fatigued, or save vs petrifaction, or whatever.  And then the next Asset would have a different bonus and different risks/costs.  So now the choices available to you are meaningfully represented in system terms.  And, hopefully my example with points and stances and pacts and whatnot illustrates how the outcomes of engaging the system create new landscapes of choices.<br/><br/>There could also be more direct ways to optimize for choice, I suppose, like using some options tree a la Spellbound Kingdoms or Kagematsu, or just listing cool choices and having different actions/outcomes invoke different items from that list...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454148/#Comment_454148" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-23T22:43:01+00:00" title="June 23, 2016 10:43PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's actually a pretty simple but potentially fruitful idea:<br/><br/>When you try to create an asset or advantage, you say what benefit you're trying to accrue (e.g. get through the armour) and then we decide what the cost/drawback/complication might be (you could break your knife). <br/><br/>Climbing up onto the table might give you a high ground advantage, but it makes you an easier target for missile fire.<br/><br/>That kind of thing can easily be done on the fly, and pretty rich in possibilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_454154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454154/#Comment_454154" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-24T04:23:50+00:00" title="June 24, 2016  4:23AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So treating Assets more like AW Moves then?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454156/#Comment_454156" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-24T05:06:46+00:00" title="June 24, 2016  5:06AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure what you mean by that?

I'm lost! Perhaps I'll try an example.<br/><br/>My idea is that any Asset you're angling for is defined, in the moment, as an advantage and a disadvantage or price.<br/><br/>For instance, you're in a fight and you want to keep the Black Knight from getting at your friend, who is [doing something important over there]. You decide to charge him from behind and push him up against the wall. The advantage you're going for is that you will be limiting his movement - he won't be able to move without getting you off his back first.<br/><br/>What's the disadvantage? We might say that it's that you're also defenseless while you're doing this. Perhaps this means an AC penalty for anyone else in the fight who wants to attack you, as you're occupied with the Knight. <br/><br/>So, in effect, any Asset has a Price.<br/><br/>If you're in a great position, the Price might be very small (in our example, if there's no one else around, who cares about the AC penalty?). If you're in a bad position (e.g. surrounded by other opponents), it might be really serious.<br/><br/>I don't see how that's AW-like at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_454174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454174/#Comment_454174" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-24T19:15:02+00:00" title="June 24, 2016  7:15PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Asset: Captain America's Shield<br/>Roll: Just\n<ul><li>Gain extra action to defend another.</li><li>+1 to Move</li><li>Lose access to Asset.

In practice I encounter two problems: <i>The proliferation of tags</i> and <i>the additional layer of indirection</i>.<br/><br/>The proliferation of tags is due to players wanting to create new ones and means there's eventually going to be lots of little rules scattered about. The additional layer of abstraction makes it necessary to look up the tag before you know what the effect is which takes extra time and effort. The best solution I've found is to just list the effects directly under the Asset.<br/><br/>What was your original AW thought though?<br/><br/>Going back to the beginning, almost every 'create an asset' system also uses some pool of points or exceptional roll to 'power' an Asset, and if you lack those your Asset won't be of any additional use <i>even if you have it</i>. Fate Aspects ran into this problem hard. It ultimately means such system are, as you suggested, nothing more than a complicated version of getting a bonus on a good roll or by spending a point.<br/><br/>So if we're going to do that, then maybe we should just ditch the bonuses altogether and just make it <i>mandatory</i> for an Asset to be accounted for in the description? So if you use your momentum as an Asset against your opponent, they need to describe <i>how they counter or utilize that Asset in their response</i>. Perhaps this can even be given mechanical significance by having certain conditions make addressing certain classes of Assets in those descriptions impossible, making it a game about discovering which Assets an opponent can't account for.<br/><br/>Or maybe ditch Assets altogether and just go with Complications like (from what I remember) the Firefly RPG did, as it's usually easier to discretely identify the things which make an action more difficult than it is the things which make it easier, I suspect because easier almost always implies simpler.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454199/#Comment_454199" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-25T17:59:48+00:00" title="June 25, 2016  5:59PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have the same concerns.

I like this even better! It's colorful and consequence-abetting, and also a bit clever, and there's some suspense as we see whether the steps unfold as intended.<br/><br/>But now we get to system. "It might work" and "it's clever" need to be supported there, or I'll be disappointed.</blockquote>\nThis is very similar to a situation that came up in our 5e campaign.<br/><br/>We came onto the scene of a werewolf that had freshly killed an NPC who was actually equipped to fight werewolves, having a silver spear and silver arrows. The Druid and Barbarian came up with a cool idea: the Druid would cast Jump on the Barbarian, and then the Barbarian could jump high in the air and land a devastating blow using the NPC's silver spear, with all the momentum of a falling Barbarian behind it.<br/><br/>Obviously, 5e doesn't provide any explicit rules for this sort of thing, but it has <i>so many rules</i> that you feel like you should be able to ground the outcome in those rules somehow. So we spent a few minutes looking up how high you can normally jump (it's complicated and based on Strength), and what exactly the text of the Jump spell says (it says that it triples distance, not height, but logically in order to jump three times as far without moving faster laterally, you'd have to jump higher as well \u2013 nine times as high, in fact, unless the spell alters the effects of gravity on you) but ultimately <i>none of that matters</i> because your ruling is going to be arbitrary, right?<br/><br/>I guess the closest you could get is to say that, well, you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 10 feet you fall, so in this case we'll add the falling damage to the spear attack if you hit, and you'll take the falling damage if you miss. In retrospect that actually sounds pretty solid, but that never occurred to us at the time, and I don't want to have to look up obscure rules, decide how the Jump spell actually works, and solve a kinematics equation to figure out that I'm doing an extra 2d6 damage with my cool magical jump attack.<br/><br/>In the end what we did was the worst of both worlds. We looked up those rules and essentially cast them by the wayside, with the GM requiring some Athletics rolls for variables we didn't understand and which I'm not sure the GM quite understood either. Something to do with advantage/disadvantage, and extra damage? And/or taking damage on failure? I'm pretty sure most of those rolls were made up on the fly, after the decision to do the attack was made, so no one knew what the stakes were, and there was a lot of "oh, what?" from the players. And to this day <i>I still don't know how the magical jump attack affected the outcome</i>.<br/><br/>If I were GM and could do this all over again with the benefit of hindsight, I would probably rule that the attack would require an Athletics roll versus AC in addition to the normal attack roll but would automatically crit, or something along those lines, and I'd vet that ruling with the players and make the stakes fairly explicit.\n<blockquote>In my experience, "create an asset" gets rules-first really quick, and winds up divorced from the fictional particulars.</blockquote>\nYeah, that's been my experience as well. The exact nature of Aspects in FATE is unclear. It's a one-size-fits-all approach that <i>still</i> doesn't fit if you try to do something that isn't obviously modeled by one of the core actions. But I think your initial question, when generalized, is "what happens when I do something creative that isn't modeled by the system?". And no system can model everything unless it paints in very broad, unsatisfying strokes. I think this is where "rulings, not rules" is the right approach, and a ruling can always be codified if you find yourself doing a lot of spin-jump-slash attacks. Maybe if we (the players) knew how a Jump-enhanced attack works in our game, we'd be using that strategy again!<br/><br/><small>(edit: I was quoting the wrong poster the whole time!)</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_455187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455187/#Comment_455187" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-21T20:56:31+00:00" title="July 21, 2016  8:56PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also beginning to suspect part of the problem is one of <i>investment</i>.

It's at the heart of why different systems generate different results, and why rulings and rules are not the antithetical concepts some gamers propose.<br/><br/>I do disagree that a 'generic' system can't model 'everything' without being 'unsatisfying' however, but I intend to prove that latter <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455211/#Comment_455211" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-22T22:00:17+00:00" title="July 22, 2016 10:00PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2016 10:04PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect the ideal here is a sort of middle ground, where creative actions are neither modeled specifically in every detail nor treated as interchangeable by the mechanics.<br/><br/>An example middle ground: Apocalypse World's move outcome list entries.  They don't tell you everything, but they don't tell you completely generic stuff either.  They're in between "you do 7 points of electrical damage to his right leg, knocking him off balance for -1 to all actions for 2 rounds" and "you get what you wanted".  The fictional info that this action was specifically "going aggro" (or whatever) has been acknowledged by the system in some fashion.<br/><br/>I'd just like a creative action system that's a little more specific than that.<br/><br/>(Actually, I wouldn't mind outcomes like "7 dmg, leg injured, -1 for 2 rnds" at all if the process of producing them were fun and fiction-focused.

They make exactly this sort of thing so unnatural.<br/><br/>I guess in some modern D&amp;D edition/variant you could\u2026 take a move action to go up the stairs, then hold your standard action (or something) until the guy follows you up the stairs, and attack then\u2026 but the whole concept of turns completely destroys the tempo that David's initial narration suggests. Like, what if your turn comes immediately after that opponent's turn, so it's a few minutes of other decisions and dice rolls before we even find out how that opponent responds to your action? What if the opponent doesn't follow at all, and you're stuck having moved all the way up the stairs because you didn't get any feedback on how your opponent was reacting?<br/><br/>For my taste, a system would ideally give me the building blocks for a deceptive, acrobatic, and risky attack, but not attempt to tell me specifically how to apply them in a particular case like this. Part of the reason for this is that if Deceptive Attack is in the rules specifically, then the system starts to be a mold for the fiction instead of a medium for it. Players start to think "I want to do a Deceptive Attack", and then maybe they narrate how their character does that, and maybe they don't! It's already in the rules; why should they need to justify it in the fiction?<br/><br/>You can maybe chalk this up to a player attitude thing and not necessarily a system thing, but I think that that would be a "nature versus nurture" sort of argument.<br/><br/>\u2026<br/><br/>I guess a good thing about Aspects and Boosts in FATE is that they're abstract enough that you do have to narrate something in the fiction in order for the aspect to make any sense. If I were running this particular scenario in FATE, then I'd probably have this little exchange be a mini-Challenge. Quoting from the SRD:\n<blockquote>A challenge is a series of overcome actions that you use to resolve an especially complicated or dynamic situation. Each overcome action uses a different skill to deal with one task or part of the situation, and you take the individual results as a whole to figure out how the situation resolves.</blockquote>\nYou're probably not "supposed" to run a Challenge during a Conflict, but if we decide that we want that degree of granularity for an action in a conflict, then the RAW are immaterial as far as I'm concerned. The jump-spin-slash seems like a perfect use case for a Challenge, and it also suits my "building blocks" system wish (note: I'm figuring out this post as I write it). I'd call it a Deceive action to trick the guy into falling for your attack, an Athletics for the "turn on a dime and jump down" part, and of course a Fight action, since you're attacking someone in melee. I'd probably make the Deceive opposed by your opponent's Empathy and the Fight opposed by your opponent's defense of their choice, but the Athletics would be static opposition.<br/><br/>The way this would play out is that at each action, you'd have the opportunity for success or failure that would carry over into the next action (sort of like +1 Forward in AW), but you'd make all the rolls before interpreting the results into the fiction. Mostly. So let's say you roll even on Deceive, so you succeed at a minor cost; you roll +3 on Athletics, so you succeed with style (probably a boost); and you roll -1 on Fight, so you'd ordinarily fail, but you can invoke your boost from Athletics to make your attack a successful 1-shift hit. There's still that minor cost from Deceive, though, so maybe we narrate your attack like this:<br/><br/>You run up the stairs and he falls for it, pursuing you \u2013 right into your expert feat of acrobatics. Your slash wasn't anything special, but your falling momentum is enough to make it count, [doing whatever a 1-shift hit does in this scenario]. The catch is that he's noticed that you set him up for that, so he'll be Wary of you from now on.<br/><br/>\u2026 it's still COMPLICATED though!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455213/#Comment_455213" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-23T01:31:12+00:00" title="July 23, 2016  1:31AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess the weird part of using a Challenge in that scenario is that normally every action in a challenge is an Overcome action, but Fight has to be be an Attack action and the other two would ordinarily be Create an Advantage actions in a Conflict.

Ranging from things like faster or stronger, to wearing armor, to carrying a shield, to having a longer-reach weapon, to being standing on higher ground, etc.<br/><br/>- Your "turns" consist of saying how you (temporarily) negate one of their advantages. TBD: what their "turns" consist of. Could be things like spending a currency to recover negated advantages or create new ones, negating advantages <i>you</i> have over them, as well as other moves impacting other aspects of the larger game.<br/><br/>- When you say how you negate one of their advantages, this can be judged a risky action. When you take a risk you roll, similar to acting under fire in AW. On a fail, the opposition makes a hard move against you.<br/><br/>- The moment <i>all</i> of their advantages are temporarily negated, you get to strike hard against them: one of their negated advantages is now <i>permanently</i> erased.<br/><br/>- Repeat. So far, I'm thinking you win as soon as all their advantages are permanently removed, though I'd consider alternatives.<br/><br/>Notice how, by these rules, if your fictional circumstances justify you negating an opponent's asset without taking any risks, it's an automatic success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455215/#Comment_455215" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-23T14:21:01+00:00" title="July 23, 2016  2:21PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty interesting!

Part of what I half-readed mixed with what I half-remembered about my own game last iteration. What I have in mind right now goes like this:<br/><br/>All PCs and NPCs shate the same basic frame, a list of generic skills everyone can use:<br/><br/><i>Athletics<br/>Combat<br/>Defense<br/>Perception<br/>Stealth<br/>Knowledge<br/>Empathy<br/>Mislead<br/>Persuasion</i><br/>(maybe I'm forgetting a couple more)<br/><br/>To customize their characters, everyone chooses 1 to 3 theme concepts for their character (like race and one or two classes) and then customize the list of generic skills as needed.<br/><br/>For example, an Elf Mage would have "invisibility spell" as stealth, "Detect Magic" and "Darkvision" as perception; while a thief would have stealth as it is and "Trap detecting" in perception. Notice that customizing the skill also changes subtly the logic behind it, which is something that should be addressed at roleplaying level instead of mechanically. <br/><br/>Which takes me to the communication tools levels: these are systems meant to help players solve conflicts in different ways according to player skill and comfort.<br/><br/>-You've got the Roleplaying level, where all we need is enough crystal-clear communication and a shared opinion on how logic and common sense work in the setting (if it's more based on narrative than simulation, and of which kind/genre, etc). You identify the intent on the conversation and in the best case, without much interruptions you go straight into narrating the conflict.<br/><br/>-Then you've got the Game level, where mechanics and rules help you produce specific results, define things with a thinner margin of exactitude, relieve the GM of the responsability of judging what goes and what not, and create or aid the creation of randomized content.<br/><br/>Both levels can be used in parallel, interrupt each other when needed and even have a dynamic value across the game. You could roleplay a conversation instead of just explaining your intent and rolling <i>Persuasion</i>. The GM could ask for both things and the player could ask to do just the last if she's short of ideas or not feeling up to the effort of performing (let's be generous with tolerance, I know every GM expects players to roleplay but some may have such low social skills that it makes that part somewhat painful, or maybe they are just not in the mood right now)<br/><br/>Hmm.

It's this part the one that usually makes games rules cumbersome trying to find a single model or a lot of small ones that force player to roleplay a single variant of the skill.<br/><br/>So, naturally, it's easy for the GM and the players argument that a thief stealth is better than one of a commoner's without relying in rules to explai why, or bonuses to represent that numerically. An invisibility spell would make the mage as hard to find as a hiden thief, but for different reasons. An opponent using magical detection would find the mage on the spot, but not the thief. A creature with blindsense would find them both if they are in range. So unless players customize their skills against specific cases, they would be considered somewhat inferior, and by customizing them they are describing their limits too.<br/><br/>Even when these limits are descibed, the skill still has enough versatility to be used in less common situations, further enriching roleplaying. After all, we're already using something like this in our games and almost every rulebook advices it: <i>if it makes sense despite rules indicate otherwise, you're free to disregard the rules and roll with it.</i><br/><br/>I pair this with a particular way of narrating consequences after the dice roll: whenever the roll fails, it isn't the character who fails but just the intent that isn't completed, mostly due to the opponent being awesome or the challenge not as simple as expected. This way there's less need of assigning numerical values to the skills to differentiate them or to depend on luck to bring interesting results to the game. Yet with enough granularity and some good math you can still include bonuses in the game to give players a sense of advancement.\n<blockquote> In fact this breakdown is exactly what I'm using for my 7th Sea 'fix'. The skills are the core intentions/situations while the themes are the methods they can use to achieve/address them.<br/></blockquote>\nInteresting! I haven't tested this yet.

In some games that's a feature instead of a bug, but in most cases it's just exploiting a weakness of the game, to the point where often designers will clearly tell you in the rules that "using all-encompassing skills in this game is discouraged".<br/><br/>So, by using skill categories, besides helping the GM to identify the player's intent, we're preventing players to abuse the all-encompassing skill exploit.<br/><br/>I'll point out that while I'm okey rolling and adding bonuses, I've had great experiences using a system quite similar to this <i>without using bonuses at all</i>. It's all about negotiating a bit. Even without a rule to define that, any player will understand that an opponent found him despite he being using an invisibility spell, because that opponent didn't used sight to locate him. If a player has "thief" among his concepts, when he hides the description is of course completely different than when a commoner hides, <i>even if the player fails the roll.</i><br/><br/>That's what I meant by "affecting the roleplaying directly" that we don't rely on mechanics to differentiate things, we just talk to explain what makes them different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455269/#Comment_455269" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-25T21:01:21+00:00" title="July 25, 2016  9:01PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I totally read you now. Sounds similar to AW moves \u2013 there are infinite ways to seize something by force, but you roll "seize by force" for all of them, and narrate what your fictional approach is (choosing the move first and narrating after, or narrating first and then choosing the move, either/or). AW has some broad bonuses from a character's stats, but they're predefined, so they don't suffer from the "all-encompassing skill" pitfall you noted. There are also no bonuses for taking one approach to a move over another as long as you can justify it \u2013 Vincent even notes that some groups asked for a custom situational +1/-1 adjustment rule during playtesting, but all abandoned it after one session!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455273/#Comment_455273" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-25T22:06:49+00:00" title="July 25, 2016 10:06PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly!

So AoE attacks or twists that make the situation worse happen whenever anyone rolls a 2 on the 2d6.<br/><br/>I recall a game where a flying PC scout was trying to reach the flying citadel, capital of the kingdom to ask for help. He rolled a 2 and instead of telling him that he <i>failed to see the city</i> I narrated how he sees the city... <i>slowly falling down from the skies.</i> I totally didn't prep for that game and it went awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_455281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455281/#Comment_455281" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T01:54:00+00:00" title="July 26, 2016  1:54AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, naturally, it's easy for the GM and the players argument that <b>a thief stealth is better than one of a commoner's</b> without relying in rules to explai why, or bonuses to represent that numerically.</blockquote>\nBut it isn't <i>better</i>, just <i>different</i>.\n<blockquote>Interesting!

So far, I'm thinking you win as soon as all their advantages are permanently removed, though I'd consider alternatives.</blockquote>The equation of "they have <i>any of these diverse types of advantage</i> over you so you may not strike hard against them" strikes me as a bit contrived.  As does "striking hard against an opponent will always permanently remove <i>any of these diverse types of advantage</i>".<br/><br/>I think this system idea is a great illustration of the fine line being walked by the "advantage" (or "asset") category.  The more you define it as a concrete, unitary thing, the more accessible it is for cool system tricks.  I think the idea of whittling down an opponent by removing their strengths one by one sounds <i>great!</i>  But, at the same time, the more you define "advantage" as a concrete, unitary thing, the less the fictional particulars matter.  Once you remove an opponent's shield, it's removed, great -- but once you remove his high ground advantage, what's the fictional difference between that being temporary vs permanent?  And how would one take fiction-based actions while knowing the cued-up outcomes?  If I can think of a way to permanently remove my opponent's strength advantage, does the fiction tell me why I can't do that until I first temporarily take away his high ground advantage?  I mean, it probably could, but it probably won't, right?  The system provides a list for players to tick off, and they will, regardless of what their character is seeing in front of them.<br/><br/>But here's another part of that fine line -- if it really is fine enough, then with some skill, you <i>can</i> walk it.  I can imagine a hulking opponent, and a plan to neutralize his strength by slicing his core muscles, and a flurry of shield-warded spear-thrusts from high ground that I need to get past before I can deliver that slice.<br/><br/>So I'm not saying that the problems I see are deal-breakers.  I just think maybe this system needs a few more subtle nudges away from rules-derived list-ticking.  Like, it's boring to have to bat away the spear and the shield and resist the strength and high ground <i>every</i> time you try to do something that'll stick.  I wonder if maybe certain NPC advantages could be neutralized Ongoing by certain PC advantages, where Ongoing is neither Temporary (reverses automatically) nor Permanent (never reverses), but rather can be reversed with effort/luck/cost/something.  Or some other way of modeling how different fictional particulars can be countered or neutralized in different ways.<br/><br/>Another random thought: perhaps the win condition could depend on removing all advantages <i>of a certain type</i> (i.e. the type that inherently keeps a guy in a fight), with remaining advantages acting as a penalty to a "win now" attempt that can be made at any time.  You can get gored while still standing on high ground and holding a spear; it's simply much less likely.  But while still Strong (if advantages are absolute) or Stronger than the PC (if advantages are comparative)?  Maybe not.<br/><br/>Maybe all that's needed is to extend the same level of momentary fiction-based judgment from risk assessment to other parts of the procedure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455284/#Comment_455284" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T09:41:33+00:00" title="July 26, 2016  9:41AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>, what does your idea have to do with this thread?

Excellent points, for and against.<br/><br/>I'd be tempted to simply try it like this:<br/><br/>* We define a list of advantages for any given participant. (Ideally, keeping it short! "He is superhumanly strong, he has a reach advantage, and he has the high ground.")<br/>* When some kind of action is taken against that participant, we look through the list and see which advantages apply to *that* action. Each one turns into some kind of mechanical lever (could be as simple as a -1 to the action taken per advantage). ("You're charging him? Roll, but take -3 for his strength, reach, and high ground." "You're throwing a rock at him from a distance? Ok, roll. It doesn't matter that he's strong or has a long spear, so roll at -1 because he's got the high ground and you're down below.")<br/>* Case-by-case, we have options for removing or nullifying advantages. We choose from those moves to be triggered by fictional attempts. (Perhaps AW-style moves like "When you act to nullify an opponent's advantage... on a 7-9, you do so, but only until they act to reverse that." We can easily parse this fictionally - you've pushed their spear off-target, but the moment the ogre has a chance to turn it back on you, it will be just as much of a problem as ever. Similarly, you could have a move for "take an advantage away from an opponent (taking it for yourself)". It's clear how to do that with a spear and with the high ground, but you'd have to have some really unusual abilities to 'trigger' this move for the ogre's superhuman strength.)<br/><br/>There are still some potential issues, and we'd need the right game design to make those calls fairly easy to make, but it sounds like fun to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_455313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455313/#Comment_455313" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T22:56:16+00:00" title="July 26, 2016 10:56PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if assets were another <i>skill check</i> you could make where failure meant you couldn't attempt another action that turn and success meant you could with a bonus?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455314/#Comment_455314" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T23:08:19+00:00" title="July 26, 2016 11:08PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorcerer (and TSoY) do this very well, with "rollover successes".

Maybe they could share a generic quality but also have different individual qualities.<br/><br/>So, imagine a PC Advantage means 2-3 things:<br/>1) +1 to a roll (always)<br/>2) one immediate Risk (always)<br/>3) one immediate Upside (if applicable)<br/><br/>I do my spinning stair jump.  The group asks what I consider my Advantages to be.  I name height, momentum, and surprise, probably mentioning some hoped-for Upsides in the process.  The group judges which of these really count as Advantages or are just trivial.  They figure the only reason height matters is momentum, so they reduce it to 2 Advantages, momentum and surprise.  Then, we pick what I roll for.  Depending on the details of the system, maybe I'm rolling to slice my opponent, or maybe I'm just rolling to knock him into a position where I can slice him next round.  Either way, I prepare to roll at +2 for my 2 Advantages.  At the same time, the GM names a Risk for my momentum (lose my balance, come down in a heap) and a Risk for my surprise (enemy has <i>no</i> idea what's coming and continues with his thrust, which I skewer myself on).<br/><br/>(Risks and upsides could also be divided into "immediate" and "subsequent" if desired.)<br/><br/>I roll and we determine the basic outcome of my intent.  If that outcome obviously makes named Risks and Upsides impossible, we forget them.  If it doesn't, we roll separately for them.  Some of these rolls may cover immediate things like damage, while others will dictate subsequent positioning (perhaps with mechanical relevance, if desired; we do have a die roll to feed into that).<br/><br/>So, let's say I'm rolling to slice the guy hard, with my +2 I succeed, then we ask, could I also come down in a heap?  Could I also get skewered?  Neither seems likely, but neither seems impossible, so the group or GM declares "unlikely" which means 1-2 on a d6 (with "average" meaning 1-3 and "likely" meaning 1-4).  I roll twice and do not get skewered but do land in a heap.<br/><br/>One of the Upsides I had named was that my opponent would end up on his back, which we now determine is pretty likely, and indeed another roll confirms that happens.<br/><br/>The "on his back" die result and "in a heap" die results could be compared to see which has more impact going into the next round/action.  If I'm one integer more "in a heap", maybe my next action is at -1.<br/><br/>Is this a good system?<br/><br/>I think it'd suck to learn, but with fluency, it might be a lot of fun.  There are a lot of fictional judgments in there, but hopefully they're of the kind that's fun, and no individual one of them is so consequential that it needs to be sweated over.  And then there's just enough numbers and dice and ordered procedure to hold all that fiction-work together.\n<blockquote>Your (NPC) opponent is mechanically defined as a list of advantages they hold against you at the beginning of the fight.</blockquote>Coming back to this idea, and combining it with my idea above: opponent Advantages could count as penalties against your roll, and instead of creating your own Advantages, you undertake actions which entail Risks and Upsides in the process of eliminating those penalties.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455350/#Comment_455350" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-27T23:06:55+00:00" title="July 27, 2016 11:06PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, if you're going in this direction the best advice I can give is to try and make it more efficient by using less rolls.

The latter approach felt unnatural to me when I first encountered it \u2013 why should I get to choose which negative consequences by character suffers? \u2013 but then I thought about it some more and realized that you will approach an task certain ways depending on your priorities, and those priorities will (hopefully) be reflected in the outcome if you can't resolve the task perfectly. Cutting corners versus playing it safe, and so on.<br/><br/>I remember Eero wrote something about "stunting" in his OSR campaigns, where each +5 over the DC on a roll usually led to an additional degree of success or an additional favorable outcome. So-called because of the resulting "stunts" that a character could pull off in combat as a result. Maybe a similar approach could work with this direction \u2013 for every +X you roll about some TN, you get to choose one of the favorable consequences or avoid one of the negative ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455355/#Comment_455355" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-28T03:20:58+00:00" title="July 28, 2016  3:20AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2016 3:23AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that making a ton of rolls has its downsides.<br/><br/>I really dislike mechanically entangling multiple fictionally unrelated factors, though.<br/><br/>Either I'm making a roll to slice a guy, in which case using my margin of success to arbitrate landing and injury seems artificial (and, more importantly, over time, creates a boringly predictable <i>pattern</i> of such artificiality), or I'm making a roll to "have this entire thing go well for me", which gets us back to the classic problem where the specifics of my choices don't matter much.<br/><br/>The laborious breakdown in my example isn't there for the purpose of introducing extra rolls; it's there for the purpose of distinguishing <i>this</i> action (and <i>this</i> risk and <i>this</i> upside) from any old action (and/or risk and/or upside).<br/><br/>If you can think of a way to do <i>that</i> with fewer dice, then yes, let's!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455357/#Comment_455357" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-28T04:43:53+00:00" title="July 28, 2016  4:43AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2016 4:44AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a similar but less procedural idea:<br/><br/>Use PbtA-style move triggers.

As for precise and granular, well, what I want is for little details of actions to matter because of their specific nature.  Whether that's better handled by 6 die rolls or by principled freeform or somewhere in between is an open question, I think.\n<blockquote>If you have both Risks and Advantages involved in an action, then the possibilities get more interesting.</blockquote>The color gets more interesting, for sure.  But I'm looking for the meaningful consequences to get more interesting too.  "+1 from A" and "+1 from B" are both just +1, and although I can narrate cool-sounding actions to my heart's content, and maybe be rewarded with cool-sounding descriptions of how the +1 manifests, in the end I feel like my choice between A or B doesn't matter as much as I'd like.  That's the feeling I get from "a Risk is a Risk" and "an Advantage is an Advantage".<br/><br/>"Each Risk simply is what it is in the fiction if it comes to pass" has more potential, I think, but that depends on how you refer to your new position when choosing your next action.  If I was Risking "belly flop", and then I do belly flop, but then next round I just take my next action as if I'd never belly flopped, then who cares?  I'd like either a mechanical impact or a guarantee that the belly flop will impact my subsequent options.  But tracking such chains of consequence can be more work than simply arbitrating stuff that's consequential immediately -- "belly flop, take 2 damage" or "belly flop, lose an action" or whatever.<br/><br/>So perhaps that's where the "precise, granular simulation" thing is coming from.  I'm not sure which of the various cool ideas in this thread have more or less of that, but I'm pretty sure there's some variety.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455361/#Comment_455361" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-28T06:17:10+00:00" title="July 28, 2016  6:17AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2016 6:17AM by jangler.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"Each Risk simply is what it is in the fiction if it comes to pass" has more potential</blockquote>\nThat's been my assumption.

Note how, for example, "nullify advantage" is much less powerful than "take an advantage for yourself".<br/><br/>The combination of fictional triggers ("how do you do that?") and different moves with different outcomes should, if we set it up right, create a landscape of different options.<br/><br/>Some guy's got the high ground? I could rush him to knock him off (seize it for myself), but that's also "risky", so we include a chance of getting run through (like AW's "acting under fire")...<br/><br/>However, riding near on a chariot or floating platform would simply nullify his advantage (but not require you to avoid getting run through, if you did it slowly).<br/><br/>There would definitely be a distinction between a maneuver which nullifies an advantage permanently vs. temporarily. You choose "nullify it temporarily", "nullify it ongoing", or "seize it for yourself", depending on your fictional positioning.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you can't think of a way to nullify the guy's high ground, you don't have the, um, grounds to trigger that move at all.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459257/#Comment_459257" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-13T23:20:17+00:00" title="January 13, 2017 11:20PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2017 11:20PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few months later, returning to the "other players rate an action on whether/how/in what ways it's likely to succeed/fail/other" idea, I just wanted to chime in with this brainstorm:<br/><br/>- Each player is responsible for one dimension of judgment.

This is what I'm interested in because I think it is the biggest challenge. I will read the thread regardless, I'm just wondering. <br/><br/>BTW, this is what I mean by Story Games since we use the term differently:<br/><br/>I think about a Story Game as a game in which the players tell a story together collaboratively in a story-first sort of way, rather than having the main goal be singular-character POV emersion, with no one having too much more control or authority than another. This doesn't mean that there can't be characters and roles in a Story Game, just that the story is shared and is an important part of the game.<br/><br/>Thanks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459301/#Comment_459301" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-15T16:57:48+00:00" title="January 15, 2017  4:57PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread never mentions intrigue specifically, but it does discuss how to make fictional positioning matter mechanically.

On the surface, this thread has nothing to do with intrigue at all. However, the sort of intrigue play you keep talking about has everything to do with a fluid and flexible application of "assets" or "advantages" (e.g. your interest in Fate's Aspects), which is what this thread is about. As you can see, it's not an insignificant design challenge, and great solutions (in my opinion) do not yet exist. However, some good ideas are being thrown about here, and problems worth considering in depth are being discussed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20617/problems-with-assets-advantages/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20617/problems-with-assets-advantages">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20617/problems-with-assets-advantages/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20617/problems-with-assets-advantages/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20617%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20617%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
