I started the design for Game Chef, inspired by both my ingredients and my frustration that the officially licensed Doctor Who RPG didn't seem to capture the heart of what I love about the show. In my first playtest the play procedures worked well enough to convince me that the game has legs, but since I was GMing the game and created the pre-gen characters myself it's hard for me to gauge whether my adventure-prep procedures and character creation rules worked because they're good procedures or whether my vision of how I wanted the game to play was doing most of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>It would be helpful for me if some people would try to run through the adventure creation or companion character creation procedures and report their experiences. Basically, I'd like some usability testing on these parts of the game: people telling me their raw emotional reactions to what they're reading, where they're getting confused or having to backtrack, what tasks are difficult or easy, places where you felt bored or disengaged, etc., and showing me the results so I can see if the game is really doing what I intended it to do. The adventure creation rules are on page 5 and 6 of the <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Getting-There-in-Time-rev02.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF</a>, with an example on pages 12 to 15. The character creation rules are on page 8 and the pre-gen characters on page 9 are examples. You might be able to run through the procedures by reading just those pages, but getting the full context by reading the entire PDF probably wouldn't hurt, although there are places where I think I was overly concise, due to the wordcount realities of Game Chef. (There's also an implicit expectation that the adventure and characters should be tonally appropriate, so the companions shouldn't be terrible people, etc.). The adventure creation rules cover only one style of story in the current draft -- eventually I intend to have multiple procedures that cover a few different styles of story, but I'd like to make sure I'm in the right ballpark with my procedures before replicating them in multiple contexts.<br/><br/>[edit: I posted a new draft of the rules since I started the thread: <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2012/06/28/getting-there-in-time-rev-0-3-1/" rel="nofollow">Getting There in Time rev0.3.1</a>.]<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380468/#Comment_380468" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-01T12:48:26+00:00" title="June  1, 2012 12:48PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2012 12:55PM by thor.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like the perfect game for playing <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorSpacetime" rel="nofollow">Inspector Spacetime</a>!

I just spent an hour creating a character and scenario for this thing and my computer ate it when I tried to post!<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, first: the fact this has a GM is a huge turn-off for me. But as a DWFCA Whovian since 1983, I am obliged to post the ersatz version of my favorite companion:<br/>\n<br/>\nOrgull Shivrot (Also known as "Shiv")<br/>\nd6 Trait: Alien Expatriate, Pos.Trait: Adanced, Neg.Trait: Inhuman<br/>\nd8 Trait: Agent of the Cosmic Beldame, Pos.Trait: Protected, Neg.Trait: Backstabber<br/>\nd10 Trait: Practical Royalty, Pos.Trait: Logistics, Neg.Trait: Arrogant<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen betraying or abandoning the Chronomaster to a boobytrap or ambush (Protected vs. Inhuman)<br/>\nWhen trying to worm out of a deal (Protected vs. Arrogant)<br/>\nWhen assisting hostile aliens to buy some time (Advanced vs. Backstabber)<br/>\nWhen ordering primitives (especially Earth Monkeys) about (Advanced vs. Arrogant)<br/>\nWhen fleeing a danger everyone else is suicidally facing (Logistics vs. Backstabber)<br/>\nWhen advocating a more efficient but ruthless way to do things (Logistics vs. Inhuman)<br/>\n<br/>\nFLOWERS ON THE DOLMEN<br/>\n(I was gonna turn this into a semi-feminist fan fiction with Jenny and Susan, but I'm having trouble finishing Hunger Below right now and this is way too close to the Pandorica Opens, which I didn't really like. So you can have it! Besides, it's lifted whole cloth from the Mabinogion, I think.)<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 1: Ancient Earth, The Salisbury Plain in Celtic Times<br/>\nStep 2: Folklore inspiration: The Flower Maiden, Bloduweth<br/>\nStep 3: Sci-fi twist: Bludaweth is a living component of an ancient "Landmine" left behind during a great conflict involving the Chronomaster's people. She knows she isn't human but she doesn't know her true nature is that of a detonator cap.<br/>\nStep 4: Characters: Bludaweth, Celtic Chieftan, Rival Chieftan, Roman Emmissary, Chieftan's Mother, Bumbling Druid<br/>\nBludaweth is very beautiful but knows she isn't human<br/>\nBludaweth resents being summoned into being as a political offering and the idea of arranged marriage even more<br/>\nCeltic Chieftan, Lew, is a pretty nice guy for a Celt, but he's clearly losing<br/>\nCeltic Chieftan, Lew, listens to his mother a little too often<br/>\nRival Chieftan, Gron, is a brutal warmonger but has far more animal magnetism and raw virility than Lew<br/>\nRival Chieftan, Gron, is also a clever schemer who is making secret deals with Rome<br/>\nThe Roman Emmissary, Lucian, is a bored middleman who just wants to go back home<br/>\nThe Roman Emmissary, Lucian, is a born-and-bred skeptic, secretly doubtful of even his own auguries<br/>\nThe Chieftan's Mother, Arian, is a superstitious fanatic<br/>\nThe Chieftan's Mother, Arian, is the real power behind the throne and a little over-protective of Lew<br/>\nThe Bumbling Druid, Gwydion, is obviously a fraud to time travellers<br/>\nThe Bumbling Druid, Gwydion, has an uncanny knack for accidentally accessing alien devices<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 5: If the Chronomaster and Companions can't defuse Bludaweth (or convince her to sacrifice herself) then Stonehenge will implode History, leaving a huge swath of Empty Time which evil entities, such as, Oh, I dunno, the Cosmic Beldame, can turn into a Garden of Chaos - which would be a Bad Thing<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 6: Add details:<br/>\n1 Bludaweth is clearly more attracted to Gron than Lew<br/>\n1 Gwydion's stupid little ceremony at Stonehenge shouldn't work, but it somehow shifts time<br/>\n1 Lucian of Rome and Gron are clearly plotting something<br/>\n1 Stonehenge contains markings left by the Chronomaster's own people<br/>\n2 Gwydion seems to do the same subtle thing each time he activates a Time Shift<br/>\n2 Bludaweth knows a lot more about her true nature than she lets on<br/>\n2 There's something horribly wrong with the flowers left behind after a Time Shift<br/>\n2 Gron is about ready to help the Romans invade<br/>\n3 The Stonehenge Landmine was left behind on purpose<br/>\n3 Arian actually guided Gwydion to the Bloduweth ceremony, but her knowledge is wrapped up in superstitious and fervor<br/>\n3 Bloduweth really wants to live<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 7: Create Seed List<br/>\nThe Salisbury Plain<br/>\nStonehenge<br/>\nLew's Hill Fort<br/>\nGron's encampment<br/>\nGwydion's pathetic grove<br/>\nThe Garden of Chaos <br/>\nWeird Areas of Empty History<br/>\nSecret Chamber below Stonehenge where the Apple Kid went after returning his book (kidding!)<br/>\n<br/>\n(Okay. That's all I got.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou want feedback:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to clarify how to do the "When something happens, roll trait vs. trait" rules a bit more. I managed to work it out from the example but I have a feeling I still didn't quite get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should point out that I rather like the mechanic, however. It seems like fun.<br/>\nIn order for me to create the character, though, I had to pretty much make a half-list of when statements first, then figure out some negatives and positives that would suggest those, then go back and finish the full six item list.  I do like the way it forces you to think how the aspects of your own personality will conflict with itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a way you could do this between characters? My positive vs. your negative? I dunno. Maybe it's a rule I missed. I was just trying to blaze out a character.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdventure creation is quite a long process and I think it's going to be more dissapointing than fulfilling (at a guess, I'd say the average group will miss a majority of these plot points - the only real shot you'd have at following them is if all the players contributed the plot points in steps 6 &amp; 7 and got some kind of reward for crossing them off. If I was trying to run this, I know I'd miss a lot of them as players took the story all over the place.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you thought about combining the criss-cross thing you do with the When you... roll Pos.Trait vs. Neg.Trait ... bit with having players create their own plot points to pursue?

Personally, I try not to fall in love (or hate) with any mechanical element in isolation. What matters to me is if they're right in the context of the game. I felt that asymmetric player roles were important for this game, and that one of the roles in this game was close enough to what other games call a GM that it was the least-bad choice (the risk of seeming cutesy or pretentious runs pretty high when you name player roles). Personally, I think the GM role in this game is interestingly different from the way other games do it, but not everyone will see it that way.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>Is there a way you could do this between characters?

There's a subtle encouragement to play to each others aspects in the roleplaying, I mention it in the last paragraph on page 4.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>Have you thought about combining the criss-cross thing you do with the When you... roll Pos.Trait vs. Neg.Trait ... bit with having players create their own plot points to pursue?

But players have authority to frame their scenes around what they want, they aren't obligated to follow "the plot" (although they do have to play their characters with integrity, which will often involve them caring about things happening around them). The journey isn't the destination -- the mechanics of the game are intended to be orthogonal to plot, more about the characters' experiences on the way (i.e. "getting there" is the fun). The full game will probably have advice about creating non-human companions (there's only so much room in a Game Chef draft) but I think one main Chronomaster is also part of charm of a Doctor Who story (Romana has a very different role than The Doctor), so I don't foresee that part of the game changing much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380593/#Comment_380593" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-03T09:17:31+00:00" title="June  3, 2012  9:17AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I certain respect your arguments, although, as you can see, I have a very strong GMless agenda and I always prod designers just in case they suddenly get a breakthrough and say "Hey, yeah, my game would be awesome as a peer-driven system" or something like that.

I personally suspect your concerns are misplaced and I could explain why, but generally getting into debates about feedback is a bad idea because it just encourages the designer to entrench their position.

I know you're deeply invested in the concept of GM-less games. I'm not saying this game works because it "fits my style", I'm asserting that this is a good and functional way for many people to play (pending further playtest results, of course). I'm not trying to force you to change your mind, but I'm suggesting to you that viewing every game through such a strong "GM yes/no?" lens may not be the best way to analyze games (I don't mind if you dislike my game, I'm cool with everyone having their own tastes, this is just my philosophy of how to best engage with new games in general -- I'd say something similar if your pet concern was something like dice vs. cards or fantasy vs. sci-fi, i.e. I think it's better to take each game on its own terms rather than to pre-decide what's the best choice for all games). You used the expression "peer-driven system" earlier, as another way to say GM-less, but I don't think there any reason to believe that the GM in this game isn't a peer of the other players -- this GM doesn't have any weird abusive powers or social role, they're just another kind of player that is bound by rules, it's just that the things they do in the game touch different rules than the things the other players tend to. GM-less games can be great (my first game was GM-less) but GMed games can be great, too, and either one can also be bad. But my game won't be everyone's cup of tea, that's to be expected. Hopefully some people will like it, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381687/#Comment_381687" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T03:53:03+00:00" title="June 10, 2012  3:53AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I think they'll like it just fine.

While I tend to prefer the classic incarnation, I'm a fan of both, and I think the game works for both, although it's episodic and doesn't have much support for grand arcs.

Maybe the planet will be the source of some miracle cure in the future, so it needs to stay clean?<br/><br/>I've kind of run out of steam here, so I'll just give the feedback I've got now. <br/><br/>Reading through the Companion creation, I was a bit intimidated by how many elements needed to be created. In practice, it was pretty fun once the process got going. I imagine it would be even easier as a group process, with everyone making characters together, giving feedback and inspiration. I think that the Companion creation process definitely helps build a practical model of how the Companion acts and is perceived, and provides a good starting point for play.<br/><br/>The adventure generation was less smooth: I know there is an effort to assist with the creative burden of "blank page" strain, but for such a structured process and output there is a whole lot to come up with whole cloth. I like the folklore prompt, that is a good choice for this template. Even with all the incremental steps, it just felt like a whole lot of work, with occasional backtracking from conceptual dead-ends, and lots of creative inertia... And there was a bit of shock when I got to step 5, which talks about what the "bad guys" are doing to make the threat worse. Up to that point there had been no mention of bad guys, and I thought I had taken a wrong turn. Looking at the example adventure(which mine seems a bit derivative of), I saw there were no "bad guys" there, just negative effects of failing systems, so that's alright I guess.  Also, trying to make the greater threat impact beyond just the local setting was a stretch. Mostly, having so many list items to invent, even built on incrementally, is pretty discouraging.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's the feedback I've got at the moment. If you have questions or there is more you'd like my to try out, let me know!<br/><br/>ttfn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382491/#Comment_382491" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T19:23:24+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  7:23PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2012 7:24PM by Arpie.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kind of felt the same way about adventure creation.
