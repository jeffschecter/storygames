The remaining 1% are along the lines of "I don't like <i>this</i> particular change so much, but it's not terrible, and I can sort of see why it was made." Reception of the rule changes has been essentially uniformly positive.<br/><br/>The book is nowhere as majestic as the 2nd edition. It's more focused on whimsy -- but the majesty is there too, just not so much at the forefront.<br/><br/>I know the word on the street is that the book contains all you need for True Happiness, but that's not actually the case.

I perused the thread on RPG net and people have these character diagrams up that look pretty neat. That must be the lifepaths? Seems kinda burning wheel too when people are creating motivation type things for their characters, they've got a touch of the BIT's in there. Does look like there's more system than the last book though, which is good.<br/><br/>So sad about the art. The white book is so beautifully inspiring. I wish I could jury rpg book art, and slap them in the face with their book when they publish crappy shit.

I see so many indie games published on a shoestring budget that nonetheless have a distinctive and powerful aesthetic - I feel like Nobilis 3e is stuck with the dregs of deviantart.<br/><br/>My friends and I have played a lot of nobilis, though I'm by far the least versed.  Their thoughts after first reading seem to be that there are a lot of cool, new, and innovative things that have been added, but that important or helpful things have also fallen by the wayside, so it's kind of a lateral move from 2e.

What I have a problem with is your extremist view on art. Making a generalization that "all gaming art is bad" and that people should "never" look at game art is frankly narrow-minded. As an artist I can't help myself from taking offense, but maybe I'm just giving into your trolling methods. I don't believe such extreme answers are really answers at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'll take a more gray-area approach and encourage everyone that you SHOULD let game art influence your review and ratings of a game. Maybe the rules are good, but how much can an author really care about his game to let it suffer horrible layout and illustrations? <br/>\n<br/>\nI won't assume all you folks are going to snub a game just by looking at the cover and then, on top of that insult, imply that you're being illogical.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as Nobilis specifically is concerned, edomaur I think you're very objective to admit that you dislike something you've worked on and have been close to. That's a sign of someone willing to change and grow. I encourage you to push for that restoration "to its former glory" as I think that Nobilis deserves it. Great post, and if you do more layout in the future, consider "The Elements of Typographic Style". It's a classic and has been a strong influence to me personally in graphic design.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Mr. Teapot, calling Nobilis' art horrendous is ... exact. :) I'm glad you can look past it and enjoy the game. If I had that book sitting before me as I tried to convince my friends that what we're about to play is going to be awesome, maybe they would trust me and go thru with a session, but they certainly wouldn't be encouraged by what they saw; of that I'm certain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to thank you guys for being so open-minded (well almost all of you) and allowing me to reopen a year-old post to constructively discuss the impact of art in rpg game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349682/#Comment_349682" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-25T13:35:55+00:00" title="November 25, 2011  1:35PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>All things should be logical and void of beauty.</blockquote>\nLogic is highly beautiful, like sculpture.  Anyway, plenty of good art out there, if I want to look at it, I would go and look at it.  Normally when I look into a game I'd rather prepare for play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JosephKnight</cite>Saying that "looking at gaming art can lead to you missing..." is assuming that we all prejudge games based on visual appearance.</blockquote>\nIsn't this what you just posted that you did?  "Nobilis may be a wonderful game, it may provide 1,000,000 hours of pleasure to me and my friends, but the picture on page 18 is not to my taste, it doesn't excite me the exact way I want to be excited, I renounce it THUS." and you snap your fingers, I assume?<br/><br/>In games like Nobilis, with a GM and highly individuated play groups, the visual style/language of the game should be set 100 percent by the group and 0 percent by the game designer or publisher.  Actually, it will, no matter what you do, so.<br/><br/>I can envision a game where the art style does matter - say, a game where creation of art in a certain style is part of the system and "draw a picture of your character in this style" or "color this picture" is part of play.  In such a game, the art would be highly relevant and part of play and bad art would be relevant to deciding something about the game.<br/><br/>But Nobilis is not that game. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JosephKnight</cite>Maybe the rules are good, but how much can an author really care about his game to let it suffer horrible layout and illustrations?</blockquote>\nAgreed, they should eliminate all the art and have good layout, like a decent reference book or book about writing or the theater.  Diagrams are good, flowcharts are good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349686/#Comment_349686" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-25T17:13:34+00:00" title="November 25, 2011  5:13PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>I'll resist going on the rant where I think art enriches most everything.</blockquote>\n*raises hand*<br/><br/>While not the telos of a role-playing manual, if there's a game that has a setting quite removed from our own, art does in fact enrich the game, makes it understandable and even playable to (like myself) visually-oriented learners (over audial learners, who can get everything from reading). More than just "here's the faces of a few NPCs", I'm thinking games like Blue Planet, Planescape or L5R where the art really helped shape the feel of the game in some places moreso than the text.

I could rant on that topic for quite a while, but it wouldn't accomplish anything.</blockquote>\nA thousand times this.  The art is far less of a problem than the huge loss of procedural clarity from 2nd ed.  I would have NO idea what to do with this game if I hadn't already read the Great White Book, and while there are so many great new rules, many are unclear or not immediately obvious in application: the Will and Treasure rules operate on a completely different philosophy of task resolution than the rest of the system (one I would have had NO luck grasping if I hadn't read and played WTF), and I've already had one game break down into a days-long argument over whether or not you can or should use both Treasure and Domain miracles on an Anchor that also falls under your Estate.  <br/><br/>Jenna Moran hangs out at RPG.net and responds very thoroughly to questions, but that doesn't make the actual published book any better.  The absolute last thing Nobilis needed was MORE things that require immediate judgement calls by the GM.  N3 desperately needs some kind of Adventure Burner or Dungeon Master's Guide.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JosephKnight</cite><br/>What's anyone's favorite addition to the 3E rule-set since 2E?</blockquote>\nBonds and Afflictions, hands down.  So simple, so elegant, so useful.  They open up so much space for temporary and permanent effects that aren't worth statting up as a Gift.  Definitely an evolution of the awesome Secret Arts stuff from Weapons of the Gods, with a dash of FATE Aspects.  Combined with Persona miracles, they can be extremely dangerous in the wrong hands: I played with a Power of the Moon who was very much looking forward to using Estate Properties like "The Moon moves at a speed of thousands of miles per hour" and "The Moon is frequently struck by asteroids".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JosephKnight" title="JosephKnight"><img alt="JosephKnight" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/yoYMY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JosephKnight">JosephKnight</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350042/#Comment_350042" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-30T11:23:56+00:00" title="November 30, 2011 11:23AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jon and Joe.

Does it produce MP (a.k.a. Mana Mine)? So I took those two and offered players a choice: Do you want a chancel with many portals or one with a lot of mana? I found it makes sense, too: Humans go to remote places because of natural resources. Gods might too.<br/><br/>I never much cared about imperator properties, but you might give players some extra points for bonds and afflictions to represent traits they have inherited from their imperator. Or you might require players to use a certain number of their standard repertoire in this manner.<br/><br/><br/>Treasure gives me a head-ache, too. At least level 8. The others I find clear enough, but I didn't get Jennas explanations for this level - or at least I couldn't get meaningful information from them.

And for that matter, I still have no idea if Domain's Motion miracles are just renamed versions of the previous editions' Change miracles, or if it's actually meant to be a meaningfully different thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350156/#Comment_350156" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T12:26:19+00:00" title="December  1, 2011 12:26PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Colin_Fredericks</cite><br/>Yeah, I'm having trouble with Treasure - it seems to want to handle both Anchors and, for example, Thor's Hammer, and ends up doing one with some levels and the other with other levels. It seems like it would be tough to implement, and somewhat weak compared with the other attributes, though possibly very flexible.</blockquote>\nThe thing about Treasure, is that you have to remember that Nobilis is an animistic setting.  Eveything we think of as an inanimate object is actually a sentient creature with free will-- it just so happens that the choices they make always obey what a mundane human would interpret the object as doing (so, for instance, most objects are pretty lazy by human standards).  If Nobles choose to, they can have an actual conversation with any object (or, of course, they can choose not to and just interact with it like a tool).  So if you remember that, an Anchored object is basically just one with more self-determination than most.  Of course, you could be forgiven for forgetting this given that the book doesn't really stress it when it would be most relevant. <br/><br/>Mechanically, Treasure seems to be somewhere between a very specific Domain and a bunch of Gifts.  You need to decide exactly what the Anchor is good for in general, and then you use miracles to perform specific feats within that general area of competence.  This does seem to make picking up Anchors in play potentially bog down the game, if players and GM have trouble getting on the same page vis-a-vis what's an appropriate magical power for the candlestick, chair leg, or bonded accountant you just took a shine to.  <br/><br/>Another problem I bumped into (that the game doesn't seem to anticipate at all) is how the physical nature of Anchors interact with the rest of the miracle system.  Can an appropriate Domain miracle affect an Anchor?  Like, if I anchored a cat, can the Power of Cats summarily disintegrate him with a Destruction?  Or even more down-the-rabbit-hole, can a Cat Domain miracle of Motion change that Anchor's very nature, to the point of redefining what Treasure miracles using him are capable of doing?  I don't like saying yes to either of those possibilities, but as written I don't grasp Treasure well enough to give an answer beyond "I think that's a bad idea".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350160/#Comment_350160" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T12:40:53+00:00" title="December  1, 2011 12:40PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2011 12:41PM by 1of3.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe McGuffin</cite>Another problem I bumped into (that the game doesn't seem to anticipate at all) is how the physical nature of Anchors interact with the rest of the miracle system.

Comparing the examples, I think there is a difference. <br/><br/>A change could make a new kind of a thing (living songs, green and cold fire) or change trees into tree shaped  playground equipment. In Nobilis 3 all these examples would be Persona miracles, enchantments and sacrifices of appropriate estates. Living songs could be produced by Enchantment of Sentience on songs. The playground equipment is the standard example for a Sacrifice of Trees.<br/><br/>A motion can only change the place where a particular instance of your estates acts or onto whom it acts.

The Nob 3 initiative system is kinda interesting and I need to study it further, but a key part of it is that no action is un-respondable to, even if it would be expected to be an "instant kill" type action.<br/><br/>While this is certainly true, it's also true that having the opportunity to respond doesn't mean you'll have anything relevant to respond with, or whether that response will be successful.  Again, PCs always have a reliable defense against these kinds of effects on their own person by taking a Wound (and related Bond/Affliction, depending on the strength of the miracle they're resisting).  I have no idea whether or not an Anchor counts as "part of a Noble's person" in that way or not-- and I lean towards "not" given the fairly elaborate rules for exactly how and when a Noble can act and perceive through them and to what degree, but the more I mull this over it's probably the logistically sanest option.  I just wish I could tell if it was the "correct" one, because I kinda feel like I'm standing on quicksand when I try to make these kinds of rules calls.\n<blockquote>2. Your bond with it will likely act as auctoritas against such a rude action.</blockquote>\nThat's not how Bonds work.  You might be thinking of the Auctoritas Afflictions have, but that wouldn't guard an Anchor-- it's not a "this area is warded" Auctoritas, it specifically only prevents miracles from interfering with the effects of the Affliction. \n<blockquote>3. It has wounds too, though not many.</blockquote>\nI'm really not sure.  N3 goes pretty far away from rules-as-physics, so I'm really not sure if an Anchor "should" be considered to have Wounds just because it is ostensibly an NPC, given that the Anchor rules themselves are so tied into Treasure.  I really don't think they're meant to be considered independent NPCs per se-- again, the bit about Anchors basically having their own will/dharma/independence subsumed by their ruling Noble's... which actually DOES tie into rules-as-physics because it's a justification for not allowing players to use Anchor/Treasure powers without spending their PC's actions to do it, but if she's going to close THAT loophole why didn't she see the one about using Persona or Domain effects on a Treasure effect and man this game is just driving me batty.  <br/><br/>This isn't just about defending your Anchors; please remember the second point about using your own miracles on them, which is just as problematic as some foe miracling them stone dead if not more so.  In game terms, an Anchor is in large part treated as a miracle.  Using Domain to buff or resculpt an appropriate Anchor (or MAKING it appropriate via Persona) is basically carte blanche to change how your miracles work in mid-session, which is a door to a zone of pure Calvinball madness I absolutely want to keep closed.  Ruling that non-Treasure miracles just don't affect Anchors at all solves that problem, but I don't know how many others it may or may not open until I understand the rest of the system.  <br/><br/>The thing that really burns me about this is that this had a clear answer last edition-- Anchors shared the same immunity to miracles as Nobles.  Now they've lost this protection, because everyone has, but Nobles have had it explicitly replaced with a brand new system while somehow the book is totally silent on what if anything this means for Anchors despite upgrading their importance enough to literally have one of the four stats in the game revolve around acquiring and using them.  It completely boggles me that this stuff never came up in playtest or wasn't considered important enough to address, especially since second ed was very good about avoiding this kind of ambiguity.  I never got the complaints that second ed was confusing or unplayable... but I am starting to feel that way about third.

Have you played or run it yet?\n<blockquote>" Using Domain to buff or resculpt an appropriate Anchor (or MAKING it appropriate via Persona) is basically carte blanche to change how your miracles work in mid-session, which is a door to a zone of pure Calvinball madness I absolutely want to keep closed. "<br/><br/>I'm not seeing how this is so bad. Could you give an example?</blockquote>\nWell, the only example I have to give is the one I mentioned earlier, which is semi-hypothetical, in that it did not actually happen during a game, but someone asked if it would be possible during the prep for the campaign, and sparked a huge argument that reached no agreement.<br/><br/>In general, I think alllowing it:<br/><br/>a) Muddies if not invalidates the Treasure rules, which are already far from clear.  Letting you basically spend Domain and/or Persona MP to mod Treasure seems to have all kinds of weird knock-on effects that I do not feel qualified to judge, nor feel that I should have to.  Why is there a limit on number of Anchors (a soft limit, true) and a requirement to specifically define each one's area of influence if you can basically just have one that can be reshaped into doing anything if you sling enough DMP at it (or have a Gift to do so at will)?  If making a do-anything sonic screwdriver was really the intent of the Treasure rules, they seem way too baroque and fiddly.<br/><br/>b) Runs a serious risk of bogging the game down during the session (like, if this was a Project or something that wouldn't be nearly as bad, because it minimizes the arguments/negotiations during table time and also doesn't put the GM immediately on the spot).  It's not like Nobilis has ever been short of these pitfalls, but I think adding more of them is not an improvement.<br/><br/>and c) I generally think it's a very bad idea to rewrite rules or character sheets during a session.  At best, it is the better of two evils (assuming that whatever you're replacing is utterly intolerable) and at worst it derails the entire session with arguments that leave the concrete issues of "how would this change better our play" and go all the way back to first principles like "Why are we even using this ruleset at all, let's rewrite the whole thing or switch systems entirely".  This kind of thing is best kept between actual sessions of play.  <br/><br/>I found N2 relatively easy to run because no matter what crazy things the PCs did or could do (and I ran a campaign where five minutes into one session one of the PCs invoked a Domain 9 miracle to curse their Chancel so any living thing inside it would immediately lose the will to live and fall over comatose, like that one Radiohead video, and the rest of the group cheerfully got to work mass-producing golems to maintain the Chancel and care for their stricken Chancel-dwellers, as well as creating a fungus-based oneiric Internet to keep their minds active and entertained), it was understood that actively reshaping their stats or the rules of the game they operated under, on the fly, in-game-time, was not actually possible.  That was an amusing half-joke in <a href="http://imago.hitherby.com/2009/09/a-small-gift-to-my-readers/wtf/" rel="nofollow">WTF</a>, but I'd prefer it to stay there. I am apparently unique among roleplayers in that I have never created my own RPG system and have no desire to.  Game design is the unfun part I pay money for other people to do for me.  I do not think Nobilis is improved by either allowing this kind of metamechanical free-for-all, or by being written so unclearly that it opens the door for it to happen.<br/><br/>TLDR, it's me, I'm the Nobilis grognard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351103/#Comment_351103" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T15:01:47+00:00" title="December 10, 2011  3:01PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            " Have you played or run it yet?

I think it's missing an awful lot of guidance for new or baffled GMs, but then a lot of people found 2nd impenetrable even when it had that stuff.  I will say that the Keys lifepath system is very helpful for new players, though; it does an awful lot to flesh out a character with goals and supporting cast even if you don't start with a concept any firmer than the name of your Estate.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about the resolution necessarily being clearer than 2nd ed, but my experience with 3rd is very limited so far.  I'm running my first session of it this weekend, so we'll see how it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367211/#Comment_367211" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T12:49:17+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 12:49PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup. 3E is easier to play and generally has clearer rules.<br/><br/>It also has pages of rules for playing on a mortal level, which so far seems completely useless but I know there was a demand for that. It's much too complex for a game starring Powers, though.<br/><br/>It also has so much bad art. Not just technically bad (most of it looks rushed, which is inexcusable for a published product, but forgivable given the problems I've heard they ran into), but goes against the tone and tenor of the text on the very same pages. Such as the aforementioned chibi Lord Entropy. This is all over the place. Excrucians, horrors of the universe, look like they were plucked from a high school comedy anime like Azumanga Daioh.<br/><br/>It also has pages and pages of locations, creatures, and characters, if you like that sort of thing.<br/><br/>My problem with that, though, isn't that I'll just ignore them anyway (they're probably great idea spawners for many) but there are Zero pages devoted to how to run a game. <br/><br/>Not even an example of play that's presented as atypical like in 2E, but there is absolutely no discussion whatsoever about what a session or story of Nobilis might look like. With the much needed extra detail on Bonds and Limits, and how they tie into miracles and stats, and the addition of Projects (which seems like a fantastic tool to set up sessions and stories) I was shocked that there was no story creating system presented to bring those pieces together, but much less there was no advice at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheDarkness73" title="TheDarkness73"><img alt="TheDarkness73" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheDarkness73">TheDarkness73</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367439/#Comment_367439" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T07:02:22+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  7:02AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So exactly what is new in 3E?

I'm just going to list most of the changes instead of explaining them, because frankly some of this stuff needs the text in the books to explain it (and in my opinion, more text than is actually in the book):<br/><br/>Realm and Spirit are out, replaced by Persona (used for using your Estate in a metaphorical way, instead of the literal one Domain does) and Treasure (used for acting through and enhancing Anchors).<br/><br/>The timing of events in miraculous combat is more strictly defined, and there is a new system for performing mundane actions, which overlaps with the lower levels of Aspect miracles.<br/><br/>Nobles are no longer immune to direct miracles, and you need to spend an action and some MP to activate your Auctoritas.  This ties into the slightly changed Wounds system, and the new Bonds and Afflictions (which sort of brings Fate's Aspects or Weapons of the Gods' Chi Conditions into Nobilis). There is also an "anti-Auctoritas" called Divine Mantle you can activate to make your mundane actions more effective and miracles harder to oppose.  Penetration has been renamed to Strike, and Miracle Points are refreshed much more often now.<br/><br/>Chancel and Imperator creation, as a mechanical process of "pick from this list of advantages and disadvantages", are both gone.  They still exist, but mostly as color chosen by the group.  That said, there are now rules for the miracles Imperators use to change the world.<br/><br/>Dynasty Points are out, as are direct awarding of Character Points as XP-- any mechanical advancement to a PC must be done in-game, as part of the new Projects system.<br/><br/>There is an optional lifepath system for character creation.<br/><br/>There's much more detail on setting things only lightly mentioned in previous editions, like the Locust Court and Ananda's Chancel Cityback, what the Spirit World the Imperators and Excrucians fight in is like, and new things entirely like the Zu and Actuals.<br/><br/>A lot of these changes have nested effects within one another-- for instance, Bonds and Afflictions tie into the damage system, mortal actions, Treasure/Anchor rules, and can enhance some miracles.  It's not easily summarized.\n<blockquote>Would you recommend possibly using 3E as a guide along with 2E?

On the one hand, I did really, really like the lateral thinking the old system required, but on the other hand "I take a Wound and related Aspect instead of getting my head cut off/turning to stone/turning into a duck" is pretty cool too, and serves the same role of "the Nobilis are too powerful and awesome to be subject to the same pains as their lessers".  It turns the old game's "no, you can't" into a "yes, but", which is really the underlying philosophy of the whole book.  I think I need to play N3 more before I settle my feelings on the matter.\n<blockquote>I'm starting a 2e session, but I'll make sure to to look into 3e.

It's been a year and I'm still not sure how I feel about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368495/#Comment_368495" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T12:40:35+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 12:40PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TheDarkness73</cite>So exactly what is new in 3E?

It really is an improvement at the core. The core rules are fantastic.  If you had fun with 2E, 3E is a big improvement. I just ignore the mortal level rules. All the Nobilis level rules are stellar.<br/><br/>And the character creation "Key" system? FANTASTIC.  I needed to make pre-gens for a con game and the idea of coming up with 4 compelling Nobles was daunting. I only had two ideas and they were vague. Well, the system took me from vague/no ideas to fleshed out characters with estates (I was even surprised when the dashing, heroic swashbuckler type ended up being the Power of Death).<br/><br/>If you found 2E confusing because there wasn't enough setting detail, you wanted more people and places and antagonists to chew on in order to come up with story ideas (or just to understand it better), then 3E might be just the thing.<br/><br/>If you found 2E confusing because of the writing, or because you were intimidated by the prospect of creating stories large enough for these characters, 3E probably will be of little to know help. Though, despite having no advice on story creation or running, I think it does a better job of implying that stories can be about just about anything and there's no reason to be intimidated, it doesn't do a good job of giving you tools to help yourself over that large hurdle.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TheDarkness73</cite>I'm starting a 2e session, but I'll make sure to to look into 3e.

The Keys system is enjoyable to have players go through together (if you have time), but also the primary stats (Aspect/Domain/Persona/Treasures), and secondary states (Bonds and Afflictions, etc) have changed significantly and are completely improved without reservation.<br/><br/>To be clear, I run 3E informed by 2E only for setting stuff.  For example, 3E appears to have done away with the whole "Prosaic Reality is defined by the present truth" - there's no mention of it, nor mention of time being rewound a thousand years by an Imperator and creating orphaned extraplanetary Earth colonies - but that's still intrinsic to the way I run Nobilis.  I don't bring in any 2E rules for it. I just drop 3E rules that are cumbersome (i.e. mortal level actions) and leverage my 2E understanding of Aspect so I don't need them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368496/#Comment_368496" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T12:46:56+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 12:46PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Pulp Poet</cite>and leverage my 2E understanding of Aspect so I don't need them.</blockquote>\nMan, but the 3e changes to Aspect make it so much simpler to adjudicate!

That shorthand didn't work for me. I much preferred the "normal person" and "best of humanity" short hand descriptors. It was only a slight bump. I just had to create my own miracle difficult reference chart for Aspect.<br/><br/>Overall, 3E is probably easier to adjudicate (it is for the other attributes!)

Across the board, it's just as good, if not better.<br/><br/>One place its remarkably better is descriptions of Imperators and their Codes.<br/><br/>She does an expert job at "humanizing" all of the various Codes, clearly showing what it looks like to be a good guy (from a human perspective) and follow any codes, and how you probably look evil or insane to humans if you take it too extremes, but go ahead and do that and here's what that's like.  <br/><br/>I confess I didn't quite understand the Light &amp; Dark in 2E. Now I understand them both and would love to play characters adhering to those codes. The Wildlords and True Gods are presented in a refreshingly different way that transforms what I thought they were (especially True Gods) and makes them extremely interesting as Imperator characters. For the rest, they're all improved and given enough detail and advice so HGs can play them as properly enigmatic supreme beings, without having to adopt the brain power and personality of a supreme being (which is quite difficult).<br/><br/>So actually, while I was disappointed the lack of guidance on story creation and running, the Imperator section is GOLD for a Hollyhock God needing to roleplay these powerfully inhuman beings, and the Codes are great for players looking for inspiration on how to play them. I found this true of many sections, which is only why I was so disappointed by the lack of detailed advice on story creation and running.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gamera_spinning" title="gamera_spinning"><img alt="gamera_spinning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/280/n8IY31021JMRT.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gamera_spinning">gamera_spinning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383208/#Comment_383208" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-23T22:17:36+00:00" title="June 23, 2012 10:17PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't suppose anyone has seen or posted convention scenarios using Nobilis 3E?

Banes have taken root in each of the Sieges of the Chancel [I'm defining a "Siege" as a region of the Chancel traditionally held by one of the Nobles, their seat of power]. Excrucian shards are moving through the Sieges. The Temple defenses which protect the body of the Imperator Ghislaine are weakening, so PCs are on the clock to resolve this problem. Gates into and out of the Chancel have been closed and regular gates and conventional passages between Sieges in the Chancel are on the fritz, but hidden passages are accessible. PCs begin at a central point, probably at the Temple in the heart of the Chancel. Each of the Nobles is missing a memory of whom they were prior to being Ennobled - I'm calling this an Echo (sort of like a mnemonic version of a Horcrux (from Harry Potter), but much less violent and can be in any shape or form). PCs need to find and consume/absorb their stolen Echoes to fill in their missing memories and and be restored to full strength. The Echoes are located in each of the Sieges, which have become darker, corrupted versions of what they once were and should be. The Banes and Excrucians inhabiting the Sieges need to be wiped out to restore the Imperator before the corrupted Chancel infects and consumes her body. <br/><br/>The body of the Imperator Ghislaine is in a dream-like state while her spirit is away fighting The Excrucians in the Spirit World \u2013 her Powers and the Chancel Erus are charged with her protection. The Erus helps to slowly dispense exposition, put the PCs on the clock, and answer questions whenever possible. This NPC should be likable.<br/><br/>The Incursion involved a coordinated Excrucian Rite that was performed at the same time in each of the Sieges of the Chancel (every Siege should have a potential culprit/Excrucian ally/cultist \u2013 their rituals were coordinated with their allies in the Cult in each of the Sieges to bring the Chancel to its knees). The reveal in the last Siege that the Powers reach is that there's actually a sixth Siege, and a sixth Noble - The Power of Memory; an NPC traitor Power that was one of Familia, but for reasons not yet determined joined the Excrucian cult, coordinated the rituals and attempted to wipe the memories of the PCs, but failed, instead she took the memories of their lives before they were Ennobled, and removed all memories of her, and that she and her Siege ever existed. She'll be backed by her new Excrucian master, who is still being determined.<br/><br/>Impressions, suggestions, obvious pitfalls?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383969/#Comment_383969" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-30T08:21:48+00:00" title="June 30, 2012  8:21AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not bad.

How exactly can the PCs solve the problem?<br/></blockquote>\nIn order to restore the Sieges (and ultimately, the Imperator), the PCs will need to confront and evict the Banes and Excrucians that have taken up residence in their Sieges. They also need to locate their Echoes to fill in the memory of who they were before Commencement (becoming a Noble). The Banes will likely be holed up in the most defensible, reinforced point in each Siege.  One path to this is exploration - make allies where they can find them, get a feel for the place and what it's become, and come up with a plan. \n<blockquote>One idea: What about Memory having wiped her own memory and Domain and the erus being her?</blockquote>\nI hadn't thought of that - the idea of making the Erus the sixth Power is intriguing, and yeah, it does bring them back full circle. They might not even realize they've betrayed everyone.
