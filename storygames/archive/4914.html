I mean, gaming is mostly a social activity, and there are plenty of other social activities that don't require authority (no one's <i>in charge</i> of hanging out on the back porch drinking beer and arguing about politics... are they?), but a <i>game?</i> Is that even possible?<br/><br/>Part of me says "Duh! Of <i>course</i> not! Even if none of the players get to wield any kind of authority, the <i>rules themselves</i> have authority... at least as long as you choose to follow them. As soon as you stop following them, the rules you make up in their place get the authority and if you <i>don't</i> make up any in their place, if there are <i>no rules at all</i>, then you can't possibly be playing a game. Or if you were, you wouldn't know it, because even 'you know you're playing this game when...' counts as a rule. So ha!"<br/><br/>The other part of me says "Duh! Of <i>course</i> you can.

So, sure, authority's there.<br/><br/>But here's the trick:  authority existing doesn't mean authority is being exercised, or even has to be.<br/><br/>To be honest, it feels like to me that, outside of typical authority that occurs in any social group (like "that dude is the group planner"), a game could lack all authority -- but it's be purely academic.<br/><br/>Also, authority isn't necessary taken.  Authority is <em>given</em> -- like "damnit, I guess I'm the group planner."  You can take authority, but it only works if the folks you take it from let you, because otherwise there's a struggle.<br/><br/>I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110209/#Comment_110209" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T04:13:36+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  4:13AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does everyone have authority in a board game?

No one is reaching that meeting-of-minds with anyone else.

They don't recognize your authority, even if the GodMaster Guide says right there on page vii that because you dropped $29.95 on that hallowed tome, you are hereby invested with the Power of Right by the Esteemed Author.

I think that cow is pretty much already cooked.  Freeform games pretty elegantly defeat this idea.  There are lots of examples of games where, textually, all players have equal authority (is this the same as no-one having authority? That's a semantic debate maybe), or have undefined roles (for example "pretend").<br/><br/>Another cow is the idea that groups will inevitably form a hierarchy, that people will assume different roles in a game.  This cow seems pretty much iron-clad.  It may be the case that such a group could exist, but I think it's a question thast goes beyond a roleplaying forum.  This is a philosophical, biological, or anthropological question (and there's no consensus on the subject).<br/><br/>Where I think things get interesting is in the intersection between the two (The cow metaphor is really breaking down here).

A very minimal form of this is to make sure the highest-social-authority player is NOT the GM in a traditional game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
