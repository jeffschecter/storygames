It's a sort of alternate-universe-X-men game, focusing on teenage mutants at the aforementioned school. My goal is to have a game that has a 50/50 mix of high school drama and action-packed missions...<br/><br/>But I've hit a mental block with that last bit!<br/><br/>If the teachers are all so great, why on earth aren't they doing the (life-threateningly dangerous) missions? Why are the students doing that?<br/><br/>I guess there's a few possibilities, right?<br/><br/>- Like early X-men, there aren't teachers at all, just one old cripple (this isn't very interesting to me!).<br/>- The teachers are intelligent and exceptional, but *don't* have super-powers (if so, why on earth are they qualified to train these world-shattering youth!?).<br/>- Something prevents the teachers from acting (they can't leave the grounds, social/political/diplomatic concerns, etc...).<br/><br/>There's more, right? I'm trying to come up with a compelling reason why on earth these kids would (repeatedly) risk their lives to be heroes when there are more qualified people around. Any help, brainstorming, suggestions, questions, would be greatly appreciated!<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>- Alex                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dylanix" title="dylanix"><img alt="dylanix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nPR7I305WK1I4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dylanix">dylanix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388714/#Comment_388714" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T12:08:58+00:00" title="August 29, 2012 12:08PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The teachers are intelligent and exceptional, but *don't* have super-powers (if so, why on earth are they qualified to train these world-shattering youth!?).</blockquote>\nCould it be that powers manifest in youth only, and after a certain age the powers are lost?

Think of something like 'The Invaders', where a handful of people have seen evidence of these aliens, but the aliens are  clever enough to almost totally conceal their activities.<br/><br/>Another option: what if the threat comes from within the school? The students know one of the tutors is up to something, but they don't know which one, so how do they tell <i>any</i> of them what they know without risking everything? Even if they do ask a non-evil tutor for help, how do they know the tutor won't tell others, thus letting the evil tutor know that his actions have been observed?<br/><br/>Finally, what if it's their fault? If the kids have unleashed something bad upon the world, maybe they feel responsible for cleaning up without letting the adults know, especially if the bad thing is linked to the PCs' own crimes, so exposing one exposes all, leading to expuslion or even jail.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> Actually, really finally, the ultimate reason is: because that's the premise of the game. I've beaten myself up trying to rationalise the expected behaviour of PCs in many games, only to discover that the players really don't care about the inconsistencies in that set-up, they just want an excuse to kick ass. There's plenty of fictions out there where the teen heroes take on the big bads and no-one ever questions why they don't just go to the authorities, at least more than once anyway. So, if your pitch is 'teen mutants go to school and have action packed adventures', then the players you get will want that and will go along with that premise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388717/#Comment_388717" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T12:15:51+00:00" title="August 29, 2012 12:15PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<ul><li>The teachers are all fugitives from justice, wanted by the authorities.</li>\n<li>The teachers are only going on missions that are too dangerous for the students.</li>\n<li>Going on these missions is part of the student's training.

Those who can't, teach. The teachers are a wide variety of those who can't, because they're retired or crippled or non-superpowered or just not good enough. There are still active superheroes out in the world, those who aren't teaching at this school, but sometimes they have their hands full and pass down certain tasks to the students. Think of these jobs as internships or co-op terms. The active superhero teams tend to recruit new graduates from the school, so making sure the students have real-world experience is key.<br/><br/>The jobs are things like dealing with minor crime lords or petty supervillains, saving people from natural disasters or burning buildings. These are jobs that a full-fledged superhero could handle easily, but they've got bigger problems to deal with. Of course, as these things tend to go, sooner or later something that appears simple is revealed to be part of something much bigger, and the students are in over their heads.<br/><br/>Fun plot hooks:<br/><br/>The students organize themselves into model superhero teams, and there's that one kid that no one picks. The teams themselves have history and traditions, like fraternities, and there are rivalries, of course.<br/><br/>The weeks leading up to graduation tend to see the visit of recruiters. These are active superheroes looking for fresh meat for their teams (the real world has a high-attrition rate when it comes to superheroes). Everyone wants to impress the recruiters for the best teams, and no one wants to get recruited by that one Canadian team.<br/><br/>Some of the teachers are extremely bitter about their jobs. Others are loved by all.<br/><br/>Some students are out to prove themselves, putting themselves into especially dangerous situations that could probably have been avoided.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388729/#Comment_388729" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T12:46:13+00:00" title="August 29, 2012 12:46PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2012 12:51PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way that I did it in my game was to indicate that the older generation of mutants has way too few mutants to be able to do the kinds of things that need doing.

You could even make it part of character creation, and have every player come up with their own answer to the "why the heck aren't you letting the adults do this?" question.<br/><br/><br/>But really, I'm with James Mullen on this:\n<blockquote><b>Edit:</b> Actually, really finally, the ultimate reason is: because that's the premise of the game. I've beaten myself up trying to rationalise the expected behaviour of PCs in many games, only to discover that the players really don't care about the inconsistencies in that set-up, they just want an excuse to kick ass. There's plenty of fictions out there where the teen heroes take on the big bads and no-one ever questions why they don't just go to the authorities, at least more than once anyway. So, if your pitch is 'teen mutants go to school and have action packed adventures', then the players you get will want that and will go along with that premise.</blockquote>\nRationalization is fun, but less effective than just asking for what you want directly. The more explicit you are about the premise and specific you are about what the characters need to buy into, the better.<br/><br/>For example, our group had a lot of trouble with superhero games in the past, because we have a few players whose reaction to that kind of setting is either to make characters who hate their powers and want to run away and call the cops and generally never fight crime, or to make Punisher-style asshats who want to murder the bad guys (along with anyone who wants to stop them from murdering bad guys). To try and avoid that stuff in the last superhero game we ran, the GM made it an explicit part of the pitch: the characters will be superheroes, they will have costumes, they will fight crime, they will uphold the law and not kill people. And lo and behold, everyone made costume-wearing superheroes who fought crime without killing people, and the game was great.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388757/#Comment_388757" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T17:38:40+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  5:38PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2012 5:39PM by J_Walton.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <i>Danger Sxool</i>, I put it this way:<br/><br/><b>Higher Learning</b><br/><br/>While promotional booklets paint a rosy picture of life at the Archibald Danger Academy for Exceptionally Dangerous Youth, Professor Danger and the Danger Patrol are poor role models, subpar teachers, incompetently reckless guardians, and mediocre mentors. But no one at the school \u2013 teacher or student \u2013 admits this, especially not to themselves or each other.<br/><br/>Class is held, at most, a dozen times a semester, since the teaching staff is always off saving the world as members of the Danger Patrol. To make matters worse, the Danger Academy is only nominally defended in the teachers\u2019 absense. Malcontents who would harm the Patrol \u2013 or, if they are not available, their young charges \u2013 frequently show up to wreck the grounds.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the campus itself is often extremely dangerous on its own, since the facilities are constantly in the process of being reconstructed, disinfected, or transmuted back into their original state. No one is surprised, given the circumstances, that the Danger Gym occasionally goes haywire, attempting to massacre unlucky students trapped inside.<br/><br/>As a school, then, the Danger Academy is a farce. What the school\u2019s students ultimately end up learning, they learn by struggling to defend themselves from alien infestations, demonic invasions, religious fanatics, murderous despots, and the like. The faculty merely shows up once everything\u2019s over and tries \u2013 in their own flawed way \u2013 to help the students process their more harrowing experiences and hopefully prevent them from becoming supervillains (though that does still happen sometimes).<br/><br/>Detractors and concerned parents often point to the fact that Professor Danger is so self-centered and out-of-touch that <i>he named the academy after himself</i>, which is hard to argue with.<br/><br/><b>Teacher Conferences</b><br/><br/>When playing the faculty \u2013 who can only appear in downtime scenes, so make good use of them \u2013 I tend to approach things this way: decide which thorny personal issue of their own the faculty member is trying to process and inflict that processing \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 on the student.<br/><br/>For example, if a student approaches the Badger, worried that her fighting abilities aren\u2019t up to par, the conversation \u2013 as far as the Badger is concerned \u2013 is really about the teacher\u2019s own issues with violence and guilt about killing, mixed in with some self-loathing and a deep fear of being a bad parent and messing the kids up real good. In this way, I try to make the teachers concerned mainly with their own baggage and only helpful to the kids in the student\u2019s own interpretation, if at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388760/#Comment_388760" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T18:07:13+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  6:07PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The early New Mutant books had this covered.<br/>A) Often, the adults/Xmen/teachers were away on more important assignments <br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> A lot of the events that happened were smaller scale, things that happened when out on non-dangerous missions (such as visiting a potential recruit as future classmates)<br/>C) Many events were internal, or came to the school, as opposed to the kids going and seeking them out<br/>D) Teens are rebelious, and kind of caused some ruckus on their own                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388774/#Comment_388774" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T21:37:21+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  9:37PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To flip the coin on the adult losing power, perhaps they keep gaining power and they become increasingly dangerous to society and themselves.

This is an interesting answer to me on a theoretical level, because it forces me to question my atavistic wish for depicting a story universe where children are adventurous protagonists. Why not tell the same story with adult characters, if you're capable of questioning the sensibility of child heroes? You could even spotlight these issues by having the adult protagonists leave Kitty Pryde home when danger beckons.<br/><br/>I mean, seriously, adult people making stories here. Either write about children or write about heroes, and accept that your desire to combine the two is a cheap conceit that enhances surface appeal of your story without providing real substance. To pretend that your protagonists can simultaneously be young and important to the world at large is like pretending that all morally worthy women are also beautiful - an appealing fairy-tale fiction, but ultimately unsustainable once you've ended up questioning it.<br/><br/>(Because of the Internet, let it be clarified that I've nothing against fairy-tales, I'm just deconstructing on the orthodox hero school idea to get to something more fresh and life-like.)<br/><br/>Once we accept the above we get to the interesting answers. What if the self-interests of the children and the adults are in dire conflict? Political reasons would easily justify breaking the entirely sensible status quo - of course it's not <i>smart</i> and <i>wise</i> for these students to take direct action, but what if their teachers, certainly more capable than them, refuse to act? This is, in fact, an ordinary situation in our world: younger generations form political movements with goals inimical to the life-styles of their elders. Of course it makes no sense for the 17-year old guys to be out there organizing protests or whatever, but that's still a fact of life simply because it's the 17-year olds who specifically seem to care about the issue, much more so than their parents.<br/><br/>Thus my answer: your heroic mutant students are not endorsed in any way by their school organization, and are committing to causes that their teachers do not feel about strongly enough to act themselves. Maybe the teachers are veterans of the Great War, mighty in both wisdom and power, but also utterly incapable of realizing that their power should or could be used to enact political change. So the youngsters are all about direct action Captain Planet or whatever, while the school is actually only concerned about their patriotic commitment and kill percentages in war games.<br/><br/>You could even do this set-up without politicized genre deconstruction by deciding that all the WWII era heroes (or whatever time-frame you're thinking about) of your world prove incapable or unwilling to turn their powers on ordinary crime. Maybe there's even some law against that, requiring all these official war-heroes to limit their activities to foreign territories in an official state of war with the home country. (Maybe they all got convicted of murder and such crimes early on, and their presidential pardons are contingent on sitting on their thumbs until called to service.) The younger generation on the other hand are more traditional super-heroes, unrestrained by the mores of the past. No need to make it political at all in a partisan way, it's just about killing nazis vs. apprehending criminals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388857/#Comment_388857" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T14:04:41+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  2:04PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with doho123 and Mcdalno.

As grownups, our dreams, desires and goals have been stifled by reality. I am never going to be President, I am never going to win a Nobel Prize. Every choice we make along our lives destroys a possibility of doing something.  We dream about being younger people (watch movies starring 20-somethings, read books about a rookie cop on the beat, etc.) when we want to embrace a life that seems to have limitless possibility.  We can explore it ironically, making huge deals out of absolutely nothing ("who the FUCK stole the cigarettes out of my locker?!? this is a key issue that CONSUMES MY LIFE") or we can be straightforward with it (the New Mutants really did save the world at times.)  This flexibility makes it fertile ground.  <br/><br/>The "young mutants" comics of the Marvel X-Universe were hugely popular because they literalized the limitless possibility that youth seems to have and combined it with generation gap/hostility towards teenagers that American youth have felt since we invented American youth in the 1950s.<br/><br/>In short, I'd rather pretend to have hair, and not know how things work sometimes.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But Eero is right that you, in your game, should decide "why teenagers? why this kind of setup?"  What are your goals in doing that?  Nostalgia?  Commentary?  Some other feeling?  <br/><br/>Nostalgia is a good, pleasant feeling, a game focused around young people that focused on evoking nostalgia for how you felt during that time of your life could be very effective and fun.  (This is maybe a lot more appealing for people who had a good, fun childhood/youth like myself.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388998/#Comment_388998" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-01T07:11:55+00:00" title="September  1, 2012  7:11AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. The students have particularly useful mutations for dealing with specific threats.  <br/>2. Along the lines of the Battle School in _Ender's Game_, the students only think they are going on a field trip for school, while in actuality they are being sent on a real mission.  They are manipulated in this way in order to...protect their innocence, free their inhibitions regarding what needs to be done, prevent the mind reading enemy from detecting them as a threat...Probably could not do this more than as a one-shot.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
