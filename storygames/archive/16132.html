Can you give me some examples?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere\u2019s my thoughts\u2026<br/>\nComputer games are fantastic at making complex systems approachable by players. A good interface can enable a player to sit down and play with no prior instructions. Unfortunately, the screen becomes the players\u2019 primary focus and source of input. Even in multi player games, other players\u2019 input is reduced to pictures, text or audio. The nuance of communication and human interaction is severely reduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoard Games, Card Games and RPGs are intensely social, and generally rely intrinsically on human communication. Not just the passing of cards, but the reading of intent through body language and tone. These challenges and engagements are deeply satisfying, but often require a lot of work up front to learn how the game is played, to share it with players, and may require several time-intensive play-throughs before players really *get* the strategy involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019d like to create a hybrid, mobile device/computer driven game that can capitalize on the strengths of the platform, while still relying on player interaction to complete game play. Not just board games converted into a digital format\u2026 games that rely on players having their own screen and interface. Under these circumstances, players can receive private information from the game, complex systems can interact in ways that are completely unobtrusive to play, and players can take actions in secret. Players are face to face, and depending on the design of the game, the primary game play could be focused around face to face communication, and group decisions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Donovan" title="Zachary_Donovan"><img alt="Zachary_Donovan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Donovan">Zachary_Donovan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367870/#Comment_367870" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T10:24:45+00:00" title="March 15, 2012 10:24AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://humansvszombies.org/" rel="nofollow">Humans Versus Zombies</a>.<br/><br/>I can't even explain how insanely cool HVZ is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367910/#Comment_367910" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T12:50:26+00:00" title="March 15, 2012 12:50PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Humans Versus Zombies sounds damn cool, but it doesn't seem to be computer driven in any way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Donovan" title="Zachary_Donovan"><img alt="Zachary_Donovan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Donovan">Zachary_Donovan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367925/#Comment_367925" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T14:31:31+00:00" title="March 15, 2012  2:31PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To explain, I am going to just explain my understanding of how the game works.<br/><br/>When you sign up, you get an account number. Logging in with your account number says if you are a human (most people), or a zombie (a very small number of people).<br/><br/>For the first few days, the zombies are just "carriers." They can infect others by catching them, but they don't have to identify themselves as zombies. The way you infect someone is you copy down their account number, and go type it in at the site, as someone that you infected.<br/><br/>Then the virus goes live. Everyone who is a zombie reveals the fact, and starts hunting those who have not been infected.<br/><br/>Now, here's the catch: the zombies have to eat to keep going. When the game goes live, the zombies have 48 hours to capture a human and feed on their flesh, or else they die of starvation and are out of the game. Cashing in a "human" player's account number resets your clock to 48 hours before you have to feed again.<br/><br/>The zombies win if they infect everybody. The humans win if the zombies all starve to death.<br/><br/>The HVZ server handles all of the account information and the timers. That is the computer factor.<br/><br/>Apologies for the disorganization of this messsage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sp4m" title="Sp4m"><img alt="Sp4m" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sp4m">Sp4m</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367934/#Comment_367934" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T14:47:41+00:00" title="March 15, 2012  2:47PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is an excellent example.
