<i>A word of warning: Here is where I possibly reveal my ignorance from not keeping up with the Forge for a long time.</i><br/><br/>I've been thinking about the connection and differences between literature, TV, movies, oral storytelling traditions, board games and RPGs in terms of media. I use "media" in the snobbish art gallery sense of "tools you used to make your thing and possibly how you used them." For example: "Oil on canvas" or "Watercolor on Ricepaper"<br/><br/>(I've told the following little story a million times, so if you've heard it before, skip to the next paragraph.) It used to be that the art and skill of painting was focused accurate representations of the real world. When photography was invented, this skill was became less important since no painter could ever match the accuracy of the photograph. So, for the next hundred years or so, painters became more and more abstract as they explored just what the hell it is that painting can do that no other media can do. This culminated in the (in)famous squiggle paintings of Jackson Pollock, which were in essence the purest form of painting: Drips of paint layered onto canvas, something that no other media can be. <br/><br/>There is of course still a market, however small, for painted portraits and landscapes. Their handcrafted lack of accuracy is now considered a feature, not a bug, much like music afficianados who prefer the authenticity of vinyl records to the cold polish of CDs. (Another difference in media.) Similarly, some deride the abstract nature of those squiggle paintings for being too detached from their audience. Creators in other media have taken similar methodologies with their own works. (For example, Quentin Tarantino is notorious for his non-sequential narratives, utilizing the uniquely non-interactive, completely railroaded experience of watching a movie. Some people like it, some people don't, but he is very definitely making movie-movies.)<br/><br/>Bringing this back to the topic at hand... As I have been working on board games the past couple years, I've tried very hard to do things with that are unique to that medium. In essence, exploring what it is that makes a board game a board game. Like painters reacting to the advent of photography, I've tried to avoid any characteristics that are better exemplified by a machine, thus boiling the media down to its very essence. I'm not really there yet, but it is a long-term goal.<br/><br/>Here are a few of the characteristics of board games as a medium:
<blockquote>* Face-to-face contact with your opponent.<br/>* A real-time, face-to-face social lubricant even with those who aren't playing.<br/>* A sense of friendly competition.<br/>* In general, an emotional investment in the outcome of the game directly proportional to the length of a session.<br/>* Most of the rules you need to know are on the artifacts themselves or are simple enough that they can be remembered during play without reference.</blockquote>
(Truthfully, some of these have already been co-opted by the introduction of computerized board games. <b>This is a good thing.</b> If it could have been so easily done better by another medium, then obviously it's a feature of that medium that up until that point had been crudely appropriated by its predecessor. Meanwhile, board game designers will have to grapple with the remaining characteristics, focusing their designs on exploiting those unique features.)<br/><br/>Games aren't as concrete though, especially since so many use the same physical artifacts. In truth, it seems the difference between media in games has more to do with how the artifacts are used and how they affect the interaction between the players. <br/><br/>We've seen lots of games recently take on the characteristics of other media: 
<blockquote>* Episodic techniques of prime-time television. <br/>* Terminology lifted from cinema and theatre (scenes, acts, etc.)<br/>* Physical artifacts borrowed from earlier iterations of this media's evolution (dice, cards, reference books, etc.)</blockquote>
Yet we know and feel that this is a different kind of media, right? So, what the heck is it that makes it different? Call it RPG, storygame, whatever... What are the distinguishing characteristics of the thing we like playing?  <b>What makes it a different media than any other kind of media?</b> <br/><br/>The way I figure it, if you're going to work in a medium, that medium should be plumbed to its very core just to see what's there.                </div>

                            Now, I've hard far less experience (and success) with RPG design than pretty much everyone here, so I may be completely out of my element. Still, here's my take on the unique characteristics of this media:
<blockquote>* Interaction with other humans. This can be in face-to-face contact, which it often is. Or it can be over different lines of communication like chat rooms, snail mail, email and so on. In any case, it is ultimately about a human interacting with a human, through whatever physical artifacts may be necessary to facilitate that.<br/><br/>* A formalized code of conduct governing the interaction between humans. This can be as simple as "stalk an unwitting target and be their guardian angel" or more complex like D&amp;D. They can be implicit, like "clean up after yourself when you're done gaming at the host's house," or explicit like, "you can only have one action per turn."<br/><br/>* Participants experience the roles of both "performer" and "audience." This characteristic is shared, to an extent, with board games. Whenever it's not your turn in a board game, you're effectively a spectator along with anyone else who has gathered around the table to watch you play. Similarly, whenever you're not "in the spotlight" you're a member of the audience, though you can still heckle and shout out alternate courses of action. (Interestingly, people do this even in entirely non-interactive media, like when you scream at the girl in the horror movie to <i>not open that freaking door</i>.)<br/><br/>* Often, the play area has both a physical and a mental component, often leaning very much towards the mental. For example, Go is very physical since you know the game's status right there, in your face, in the real world. Then you have things like tag, LARPs or football, where play occurs in physical reality, but with a layer of rules overlapping that reality. (I consider these to be augmented reality games, or ARGs, as I've mentioned before.) Meanwhile, most RPGs are very, very mental since they often occur in completely unreal circumstances that must be entirely imagined.</blockquote>
What do you think are some other characteristics of these things we like to play? I reckon the best way to explore the medium and exploit its unique features is to figure out what they are in the first place. (That is unless the Forge has already thoroughly explored this ground since I've been living under a rock. If so, I apologize for the lengthy post. ^_^)                        </div>

                            I thought a lot about this last year. (Not to say that "dude, I'm totally over this," but it just so happened that last year was when I was thinking a lot about this, and I've been thinking about other stuff since then). But, to me, your third point there is the key difference, the key uniqueness, to roleplay as a medium. The way I conceptualize it is in terms of "what is the <i>process</i> of roleplay?" And what I came up with was something along these lines:<br/><br/>The process of roleplay is collaborative creative exploration of shared fiction. All of these elements (collaborative, creative, exploration, and shared fiction) are necessary! Drop any one of them and you get a different medium. Different proportions and combinations give rise to different kinds of roleplay. The process depends on the nature of the players as audience-participants, though the strength of one aspect over the other (audience over participant, participant over audience) varies from moment to moment for each person in play.  <br/><br/>What'cha think?<br/><br/>Here's some of those posts where I was doing some of this thinking, which you may be interested in checking out: <a href="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/2005/07/28/what-is-it-we-do-again/" rel="nofollow">What Is It We Do, Again?</a>, <a href="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/2005/08/11/what-it-is-we-do-2/" rel="nofollow">What Is Is We Do, 2</a>, <a href="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/2005/09/21/framework/" rel="nofollow">Framework</a>, <a>Roleplay As A Form</a>, <a href="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/2005/11/03/a-little-bit-more-on-what-we-do/" rel="nofollow">A Litte Bit More On What We Do</a> </div>

                            Are we talking board games or RPGs? 'Cause they have very significant differences (though some games blur the line, I know). I've thought alot about differeniating RPGs, and I'm even in the process of writing an article for <i>Push</i> that touches on the subject, so I can discuss that.<br/><br/>I think the the most significant distinguishing feature of RPGs compared with other narrative artforms is its improvisational nature. When you think about this, alot of the features of RPGs are more easier understood.<br/><br/>Human contact---Theater, film, and television involve alot of cooperation with other artists (writers, directors, actors, musicians). So I don't think its all that unique.<br/><br/>Formalized rules---fairly unique to other narrative artforms, but are actually a fundamental feature of other improvisational artforms. Look at Jazz, for example, participants are organized into, err... "bands" (drummer, bass, rhythm, and lead). The "band" form organizes how musicians are allowed to interact with one another.<br/><br/>No (traditional) audience---this definitely has major implications, but ultimately, I think it's less significant than the improvisational thing. Because to a certain extent, your fellow artists are always your audience. (The significance here is that it allows more negotiation than other improvisational artforms.) <i>[edit] This is certainly what distinguishes RPGs from Improv Theater. [/edit]</i><br/><br/>Mental/Physical component---This sounds more like a board game thing, but if we're talking RPGs I can say that this does have implications, but I think literature also has a heavy mental component. Actually, this is alot like radio, in that its a spoken performance. So I don't think this is all that significant as a distinguishing feature.                        </div>

                            It may be the contrarian in me, but when you ask about role-playing as a medium, my first instict is to ask "what is it about role-playing that <i>isn't</i> medium. If we're trying to define role-playing <i>as media</i>, then that's probably a good place to start. I'm not any sort of expert on media, so consider my thoughts a rather uninformed stab. Role-playing as medium probably includes rules, books, dice, techniques, and so on. It might also include the artifacts of play, such as transcripts, AP reports, mp3s of a skype game, and so on. <br/><br/>What isn't included in the media definition of role playing is the phenomen on play itself. Play is, IMHO, something that humans just do when they get together. I guess to differentiate the phenomenon of play from "actual play" or "playing this game" you could call it undirected play. Undirected play is to role playing as the appreciation of beauty is to painting. So role playing is a particular body of tools and techniques that are used to direct play.<br/><br/>Hamsterprophet, I love your definition of role playing. I think it could be slotted in here as what that direction aims at. That gives a working definition of The medium of the role playing game is a body of tools and techniques that are used to direct play into a collaborative creative exploration of shared fiction.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I have some misgivings over calling role playing a medium at all. I think of a medium as a one-way channel for communication. Role playing can be this, but a gaming session is certainly NOT one-way for those who are participating. Maybe someone more knowledgeable can set me straight on this.<br/><br/>On a side note, I listened to a skype recording of a game session for the first time the other day. It kind of opened up the possibilities of role playing as a performance. I knew a guy who carried around a huge Ars Magica transcript for quite a while. It struck me that he seemed to treat it the way that some people treat a bible or an important book that has enriched their life in some way. I can imagine a really great game session having a similar power, although I can't imagine this way of experiencing role playing games ever eclipsing actual play.                        </div>

                            Hey Daniel,<br/><br/>I think a key element to focus on is Lumpley Principle, "Fiction happens this way because we agree it happens"... this idea gives rise to many important factors- roleplaying only works through communication, the improvisational aspect, the ability to focus play on things we consider meaningful and fun, and to adapt during play to meet those goals.  It becomes the linchpin of the group as authors/group as audience connection.  Also- it is specifically a performance medium- you can undo the fictional events, but you can't undo the 20 minutes you spent making them.<br/><br/>Right now, I think the strongest draw we've seen in the roleplaying hobby revolves around this- you can make stuff you find meaningful and fun, and you can do it as a group.                        </div>

                            How is the Lumpley principle not at work in all communal artistic activities? Group creation of fiction is not a new thing. Many TV shows and movies are written by a group of writers---don't they also have to agree on what will happen in the story? <br/><br/>You might say its different because RPGs have a formal set of rules, but as I said above, structure is a fundamental feature of nearly all improvisational artforms.<br/><br/>My argument is that its the improvisational element that makes RPGs different from other narrtive artforms (or at least its the most significant feature). I don't see improvisation as a feature of the lumpley principle. I think it's something that's added by RPGs to the activity of collaborative fiction creation.                        </div>

                            The deal with the improvisational thing (can you tell I've been thinking about this alot lately) is this:<br/><br/>RPGs are played linearly. Even if we jump back and forth in the timeline, we don't generally rewrite scenes. We do negotiate what should happen, but generally speaking, once an event has been entered into the fiction it doesn't get changed. For the most part, there are no do-overs. This is the core of improvisation.<br/><br/>So why do we need rules? Because there are no do-overs, we need a way to ensure that our creative inputs are harmonized as a group, and that our creative input will propel the fiction in a coherent direction. This is the problem inherent to all improvisational artforms. <br/><br/>We wouldn't need rules if we could rewrite scenes whenever we wanted. We could just negotiate and negotiate, tweak and tweak until we arrived at a final product we liked. <i>[edit] And the fiction we could create this way would probably be more streamlined and fluid than the type normally generated by RPGs. [/edit]</i><br/><br/>But that's not what RPGs are like. We want theme, action, and meaning RIGHT NOW. We want to create that stuff on the fly.  Thus, we are *more* concerned about the <i>experience</i> of play than we are about the final product (not that the final product isn't a concern). This is also indicative of improvisation.                        </div>

                            Tim, <br/><br/>I'm largely buying your arguments about what sets RPGs apart from other narrative artforms. However, before it is complete I think it also needs some focus on what differentiates it from other group games. The emphasis on RPG as narrative artform alone will not, I think, get us a complete answer because it's categorizing the medium in a slot where it does not fully belong.                        </div>

So you mean, like, distinguishing it from *game*-games, like chess or basketball? Or what else are you thinking?                        </div>

                            Hi Tim,<br/><br/><i>How is the Lumpley principle not at work in all communal artistic activities? </i><br/><br/>Never said it wasn't.  But you will see that many other artistic activities can still be undertaken -without- having to agree with others- you can make music alone, art, even plays or video!  But the idea of a fictional event that exists because the group agrees it does pretty much is the basis of tabletop roleplaying hobby.  <br/><br/>As you yourself pointed out- the need to be able to do so on the fly, immediately, means the focus falls on the means by which the group can negotiate this, smoothly, and to reliably produce things they themselves find fun and interesting.<br/><br/>Roleplaying's unique factor is that it cannot work without LP.                        </div>

                            Tim, <br/><br/>Sure, you could do sports. But I'm thinking more in terms of boardgames, CCGs, etc. For the oft cited example: when does it go from a "gamey game" like Magic: The Gathering, to a narrative game with props, like Once Upon a Time, to a Roleplaying game, like Mountain Witch, and from there to Improv Theatre, like... whatever.                        </div>

                            bankei,<br/><br/>I think I see what you're getting at, and I will give that RPGs are inherently <i>collaborative</i>, and that the LP is a neccessary feature of any functional collaborative artistic activity.<br/><br/>But what then distinguishes RPGs from a plain old collaborative creative writing group/class? Is there no difference, are the two fundamentally the same general <i>thing</i>? My argument is that there is a something extra that differentiates them. I could understand an argument that says they are the same thing.<br/><br/>Another reason I focus on the improvisational thing is that I believe it has certain (major) implications for how the activity works/functions, while I think the collaborative element---while an important distinguishing feature I'll give you---doesn't have *as* significant implications.<br/><br/>Brand,<br/><br/>Personally, my dividing line is where the "action" or "focus" of play lies. Is it found in the imaginary fiction, or the physical objects? In RPGs, I would argue that the action/focus is in the imaginary fiction. The purpose of play is to develop and manipulate this imaginary fiction, and the physical objects are used to help supplement the decision making for the fiction. The primary decision making concern is the fiction, and very often decisions about physical objects (such as dice or other resources) are made based on the fiction.<br/><br/>Take Dogs---even though conflicts are heavily structured according to what dice you have available, decisions about whether to take/dodge/reverse the blow very often depends on what sort of imaginary consequences will result from the decision.<br/><br/>In a board or card game, I would argue that the action/focus is on the physical objects. The point of play is to manipulate these physical objects without regard to the imaginary fiction. Even when the game has a heavy imaginative element, decisions are still made based on the physical objects without regard for the fiction. <br/><br/>Let's take Chess. Even though we could narrate the game as an epic war, it's unlikely that I'm going to base my decision on whether or not to take your queen based on the love scene you narrated between the king and queen.<br/><br/>I freely admit that this line is sometimes fuzzy, and that certain games blur the line. But to me this distinction seems helpful and works most of the time.<br/><br/><i>[edit] And as I said above, what distinguishes RPGs from Improv theater is largely the the audience thing, but otherwise I think they are very siimilar. [/edit]</i> </div>

                            Hi Tim,<br/><br/>If you read my initial reply, I agree with you that improv and the performer/audience factors are important features- and what I'm saying is that LP becomes the focal avenue by which the hobby can occur.  Other collaborative projects break on those two factors, and therefore, their needs for collaboration are very different, and in many cases, optional.                        </div>
