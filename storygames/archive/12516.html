How much does our little community weigh?<br/><br/>Being the kind of hardcore forge-head who, more often than not, makes his shopping at the Un-store, it occurs me as not so much of a surprise that I have no real "favorites" amongst the nominees and that, actually, I have experience in a very small number of <i>those</i> games.<br/><br/>I know well enough to pick <i>How we came to live here</i> for best writing (what a pleasant surprise! at least <b>one</b> game text from my "to read" list made it into the nominees) and <i>Diaspora</i> for best rules (note that I'm not actually in love with FATE, but it sure beats the shit out of everything else in the category). But apart from that? Is there anything else which deserves a vote?<br/><br/>The reason I'm writing this is, of course, that as vigilant as I style myself some interesting titles may still have "escaped my radar" as they say. Your opinions, S.G. people?<br/>For clarity, what I'm looking for is games which push the RPG medium into new decent directions and out of that same old shit. Picking small press/indie products is (while virtually a prerequisite these days AFAIK) not my first and foremost concern here.

Mechanics-wise, it walks this open path between the really light supers games (Capes, With Great Power, Supers! and now Icons) and the classic crunchers (Hero, M&amp;M, etc.).  It has some really neat rules that allow for a less-statistically powerful character interact story-wise with superman types.  You can also scale it right up to a cosmic level.  It doesn't address narrative so directly that I would call it a story-game and it has a traditional gm-players structure.  It does have some interesting values, though, such as all rolls must be done out in the open with everybody understanding the potential outcomes.  It is truly a small press game, but I wonder if it fits into some of the more stringent criteria that are set out here in this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281151/#Comment_281151" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-16T14:01:33+00:00" title="July 16, 2010  2:01PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>It doesn't address narrative so directly that I would call it a story-game</blockquote>\nWhat do you mean by this?<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>it has a traditional gm-players structure</blockquote>\nDoes it have a rule somewhere which says that the GM can/should bend or ignore other rules?

Often it's possible to categorize something in one of these two categories simply checking for some details. Some are absolute deal-breakers, for example.<br/><br/>In a perfect world people would have played every game they vote for an Award, but from the beginning, people are saying that Ennies are a <i>popularity</i> award, not a actual-play one. So it make sense to try to get some more popularity to the category of games one like...  and knowing some more detail on some of these games wouldn't hurt anyway, even for people who are not going to vote for the award.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281244/#Comment_281244" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T07:14:07+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  7:14AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Knowing Rafu, I assumed it was a good-hearted joke.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281362/#Comment_281362" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T17:42:17+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  5:42PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Without knowing him, I'd agree with that, as when I read it in a serious tone it just doesn't make sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281521/#Comment_281521" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T19:20:20+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  7:20PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2010 7:59PM by Rafu.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>Rafu, would you agree to this paraphrasing of your question?</blockquote>\nSorta. But not for the purpose of this thread. Your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> item is really more of a subjective than an objective criterion anyway (unless you make it a matter of <i>designer intent</i>: then we are talking), and not necessarily relevant when judging a gaming product nominated in a category other than "best game" or "best rules".<br/>Since we are speaking "popularity contests", my point (and agenda) is more of a matter of promoting a weird extreme-left-wing-of-gaming sensibility, with bits of cultural anarchism and some counter-geek-culture-nihilism sprinkled all over it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Knowing Rafu, I assumed it was a good-hearted joke.</blockquote>\nGood-hearted? "A vicious-hearted stab at a topic under the guise of a joke", maybe.
