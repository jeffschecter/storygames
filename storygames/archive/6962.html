I do think the rules system probably takes some getting used to.  Maybe I'll come back to it someday, but in all honesty, the reason I decided to pick it up was because I was interested in it's take on group setting/theme creation and the idea of creating the rules for magic during play.  And those ideas/rules are ones I may very wall pull out and bring into other games because those worked just fine.  The best time we had with the game when we tried it was probably brainstorming the setting/situation and creating the theme document.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155009/#Comment_155009" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T15:01:42+00:00" title="July  5, 2008  3:01PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's worked very well for some friends of mine.

Generally, things have been going pretty well.  Last session, we decided to drift the rules a bit because the blind bidding mechanic wasn't really clicking for us.  All we've done, though, is basically use the same mechanics, but make it more about resource management, like a version of Nobilis where your resources regenerate after every scene.  It was really only the "secretly assign a number of chips... and then reveal!" aspects that we found not quite gelling for this particular group, which wanted to be more open and have everything on the table.  Also, we've cut back on the number of magic tokens and fanmail-style chips that are flying around, because our magic is pretty laid back and the group is comfortable enough that we don't really need flying fanmail to drive the excitement and creativity.<br/><br/>I do remember Brennan saying that there were some parts of the original printing that could have used more explanation, just to be clearer, but I don't know if they were fixed in later printings or are available on the web anywhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155019/#Comment_155019" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T16:25:41+00:00" title="July  5, 2008  4:25PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brennan did a series of explanatory posts on the forge once.

There's quite a lot of useful stuff on the Forge in the Galileo Games forum.<br/><br/>The creation of the theme document is a very important part of the game and it needs to be done in such a way that everyone is happy with what is included. This means that some people have to compromise their vision of where the game is coming from, and going to. If everyone is content to do this then, in my experience, the theme document really supports the creation of an engaging narrative.<br/><br/>It's also quite surprising the extent to which passions, which only seem to have a minor influence in conflict resolution, actually drive character behaviour. As such some of the players should have passions that either conflict with each other, or with the passions of another player. Such conflicts also drive the narrative. The fact that passions change slowly during the game means that they don't get resolved so quickly that the narrative needs to go directly to high stakes resolution. Generally resolution is interesting enough that even low stakes create interesting outcomes.<br/><br/>Some people find the resolution mechanic a bit clunky and whilst the text possibly doesn't explain all of it in the clearest terms it is certainly playable. One of the things we really liked was that whilst you might be resolving something rather straight forward like a fight, you can also introduce side bets as it were so that even if you lose the fight you might still impress the onlookers more.<br/><br/>Flaming Taft remains one of my most enjoyable games ever.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155056/#Comment_155056" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T23:31:40+00:00" title="July  5, 2008 11:31PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brennan's conflict examples were collected on the Random Average wiki, ummmm here: <a href="http://random-average.com/MortalCoil/HomePage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://random-average.com/MortalCoil/HomePage</a> <br/><br/>Look for the link "Conflict Examples."

But you already know that.<br/><br/>A very cool part of the game is that magic is introduced into the setting through a Theme Document. Magic always has a price, and may or may not have a mechanical-conflict-resolution-y effect when done.<br/><br/>Characters are fun to create. They have some flags, known as Passions. My guy had Duty: Topple the Ursa Kingdom, Love: Win back Vermillion, the fox vizier of the Ursa Courts and one other one. There are four stats, which is a good number. Finally, you have some aptitudes, which are magical and non-magical abilities. My guy had Geomancer*, Strategist, Survivalist, Brother of the Flame* and Prestigious. The ones with asterixes are magical aptitudes.<br/><br/>I felt like it was the perfect amount of crunch and detail for character creation in the game.<br/><br/>The parts that line up with others' assumptions about "unplayable":<br/><br/>The examples are really unhelpful, according to Daniel. They use a running example through the book (vampires) which didn't really clue us into what good prices were for active magical abilities, or what the scope of certain things were, etc. Examples were typically too similar to show the system's diversity and not focused enough to answer our questions.<br/><br/>More notably, the resolution mechanics aren't interesting to us. It's a blind resource bid, where you both state intents, then secretly allocate points to different actions, and then REVEAL! I found that it was non-intuitive, actions and defenses didn't match up, and it was contrived and took away from play significantly. I would have much preferred a "declare action, pick stat. Then, declare defense, pick stat. Then, allocate points" and have it all be open and sequential and good like that.<br/><br/>Does this help?<br/><br/>Also, any game which lets me make Debin Stodge, Badger Geomancer and Arrogant Oldie.... has to have potential. It's just that the text could be cleaned up, and the core mechanic could be gutted and replaced.

Basically, the tokens become a limit on how many resource points you can allocate within a given scene, refreshing between scenes.  The GM sets a difficulty or an NPC character allocates points, and you have to decide if it's worth it to allocate enough points to beat them.  Invoking Passions or Magic can be used to give yourself a higher number of resource points than you normally have, but it has to be applicable to the situation.<br/><br/>The way this works out, in most scenes, you can find a way to allocate enough points to succeed in a single challenge without too much difficulty, especially if you have relevant passions, but in more complex scenes like fights or extended arguments or maneuvering, you have to be more careful about where and when you allocate your resources.  If you win an early stage of the conflict you may end up losing later stages, assuming the conflict continues.  That kind of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155086/#Comment_155086" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T09:54:01+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  9:54AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks everyone.<br/><br/>this has very much bolstered my belief in the game and now i also know whom <br/>to look to for help if the need arises! <br/><br/>i'll admit that bidding is one of my least favorite mechanics, but having stuff develop in play<br/>is one of my faves... guess that's not so much a mechanic; anyway, i'll check it out.<br/><br/>cheers.<br/>-jackson                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155111/#Comment_155111" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T12:19:12+00:00" title="July  6, 2008 12:19PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It isn't really a bidding mechanic, more resource allocation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155112/#Comment_155112" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T12:26:47+00:00" title="July  6, 2008 12:26PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GB,<br/><br/>The part that got me was the blind part.

The book as printed is obtuse. I think folks that have played with Brennan, or learned from people who have played with Brennan, or make the same assumptions as Brennan get the game. I don't. None of my friends get the game. Each time we play it we make something different out of the rules. There's also a problem with authority as the game talks about a concept called the threshold of credibility that's butts against other things like the rules based system. For instance which idea trumps the other one. Also the conflict resolution system is incredibly murky and frustrating typically needing in game discussion to try to make sense of it.<br/><br/>The rules based construction of the Universe is golden. Having used that and hand-waved the impenetrable conflict resolution system I've run games and gotten applause at the end, but I've decided the frustration and ambiguity aren't worth the reward. I wonder if Brennan had an editor, because looking at his new game, so far it seems much more comprehensible. I'd buy Mortal Coil again if he tackled it with a good editor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155141/#Comment_155141" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T20:14:11+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  8:14PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clyde L.

I kinda feel the same way.  One of the things that really confused us was how it talks about the system both in terms of resolving individual tasks but also talks about having people state intents and set stakes and stuff like that.  i don't know that it uses those kinds of terms in the book,b but i got both of those feelings from it simultaneously.  We also had weird issues with defending against things, especially exactly how it worked if you wanted to bring in a defense later when you hadn't originally committed tokens to defense.  Granted, we didn't fight with the resolution system more than about a session and a half, but it just plain wasn't working well for any of us.<br/>Again, I believe the system is probably totally useable and playable, I just don't think it's described very clearly.<br/>Also, I'm just not entirely sure how I feel about token-based resolution systems yet.<br/>The nice thing about the stuff in the book like the setting/magic creation is that they are ideas that could port easily into other games.  I haven't really done so yet, but I'm definitely keeping it in the back of my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155142/#Comment_155142" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T20:17:31+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  8:17PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.<br/><br/>I think it would work to gut the resolution system and just have Faculty + Aptitude + d6.

I didn't work and we all ended up very frustrated and very annoyed. <br/><br/>The cool thing for us were the Magic Facts, and we had an awesome lot of them, and they cool. We had a kewl setting (sort of Hellblazer with bunch of little known historical but authentic heresies) - and we had interesting characters with both conflicts towards each other and the setting.<br/><br/>But the conflict system didn't work. It was confusing, and there were som major power-differences between players, whose characters were immortal ans those, who played veterans or newbies. The powerlevels were simply screwed, and the token-resource allocation always ended in the players being able to count before the conflict as to who would win what in intra-party conflicts. So even though I was sold, when I read the rulebook and I absolutely love the idea of the magical facts, the game failed when played. <br/><br/>I haven't studied the Forge forum closely as how to play the game, but I would prefer a rulessystem that does not require all the reading on the net. So we ended up transferring the campaign to the TSoY and played on. This time things worked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155165/#Comment_155165" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T04:46:04+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  4:46AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>Also, I'm just not entirely sure how I feel about token-based resolution systems yet.</blockquote>\nI would recommend trying a few other resource distribution resolution systems before you decide the concept as a whole doesn't work for you.

The Passions are also strong, and I feel like those two elements are really the core of the game. I might try the rules as-written (as-best-understood) a few more times but ultimately I think just hacking Magic/Passions onto another system (the Solar System being my current best candidate) is going to be more satisfying. It's not just that the system is hard to understand; it's that I don't see what it brings to the table. The blind bidding seems impractical in terms of actual play -- especially given that you are blindly bidding on one to four possible actions. Do you declare what these actions are before bidding, or after? After doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, but the rules don't seem to talk about it. Maybe everybody else is declaring their actions before the bidding? I'll have to try that next time, though the Nobilis hack also sounds pretty strong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155274/#Comment_155274" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T16:28:00+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  4:28PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I play MC with Brennan, it looks like this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Brunswick-Stop-80s-time.jpg" width="500"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zacharythefirst" title="zacharythefirst"><img alt="zacharythefirst" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zacharythefirst">zacharythefirst</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155292/#Comment_155292" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T20:01:48+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  8:01PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brennan Taylor</cite>I agree with most of the comments on the thread (even some of the negative ones).

Now, I don't mean to imply that I don't think Setting Stakes in a system works -- I think there are systems where it does work, and works really well.<br/><br/>The problem is, it was introduced in Trollbabe which, being a Ron Edward's creation, doesn't really fucking explain what it's doing in ways most people will understand or figure out until it suddenly becomes head-slappingly obvious to the general population, five years later.  It *works* - people know that, but (a) they don't really know -why- it works, and (b) they think they <i>do</i>, and they get it wrong.  Spione may be the evolution of Ron's game delivery to a point where that will happen less, but Trollbabe isn't - Sorcerer suffer(ed/s) from the same thing.<br/><br/>So like about <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a year ago</span> (edit: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1199" rel="nofollow">two years ago</a>) there was a backlash of feedback about these Stakes Setting games where people were just doing it wrong in play, and it usually came down to the fact that the reason they were doing it wrong was because the method was explained poorly or not at all in the game itself, people (both designer and player) sort of guessed at what was intended, and - again - got it wrong. The Roach and PTA were mentioned in that thread I linked for introducing Stakes Setting "ambiguously", but the list of games that (IMO) cocked up Setting Stakes in their game by not explaining it, or by including it when it Was. Not. Necessary. was... pretty long.*  <br/><br/>Mortal Coil did that last thing: put in Setting Stakes when such a thing isn't actually necessary and -- I suspect -- really isn't being used by even the game designer.<br/><br/>Why? Well, it's a Conflict Resolution system, right?  And those need Setting Stakes, Right?<br/><br/>Well, no. And also, no.  It's doesn't need Setting Stakes, cuz it's not Conflict Resolution.<br/><br/>Here we go: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25609.0" rel="nofollow">Mortal Coil: First session questions</a><br/><br/>Brennan:\n<blockquote>The conflicts are CONFLICT resolution, but individual rounds of action are TASK resolution aimed at resolving the conflict. This hybrid part can mix things up sometimes. Keep in mind the overarching conflict goal as each player takes individual actions to achieve it.</blockquote>\nUmm.  Yeah. That's not Conflict Resolution. That's Task Resolution, with a goal in mind for the end-state of affairs after all the Tasks are resolved.  Like... oh, I dunno. DnD.   In a Wicked Age.<br/><br/>In other words.  I would submit that the system is actually good old familiar Task Resolution that, due to the development environment in which it grew up, thinks (and tells people) it's Conflict Resolution, and that is where most of the player-disconnect comes from.  I'd even bet that if you watched Brennan run the game, that's what you'd see, but it's so natural to him that it hasn't processed.<br/><br/>And I don't really think there's anything WRONG with MC as a Task Resolution system. I *like* Task Resolution systems. I think they're sometimes more intuitive for most players (new or old) than Conflict Resolution -- that's been my experience, anyway.   Once I figured out what IAWA was doing, for example, it was like a weight off my shoulders, not having to worry about Stakes.<br/><br/>MC came out at a time when Conflict Resolution and Setting Stakes was simply How It Was Done -- so much so that people would sit down at a Sorcerer game with Ron and get to a fight and say "okay, so what are the Stakes?" and Ron would say "Stakes? This guy is going to fucking shoot you. Do something!"    So... that's how the game was written, but how it's written isn't really how it's played... at least, not (usually) successfully.<br/><br/>End Conclusion: you strip out the CR stuff from the text and run it as a straight TR, maybe with some other-game jujitsu bolted on to handle post-resolution negotiations -- or fiddle with the system a LOT to make it an actual CR system, which is something else entirely.   When the game is working really well for a group of players, I think one or the other of these two things is what is happening at the table, probably unconsciously.<br/><br/>Brennan or another experienced MC gm can feel free to call bullshit on this assessment.<br/><br/>( * - A couple folks dodged that bullet (DitV, to name one) by basically reinventing or reintroducing the concept, whole-cloth, in their game text.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155418/#Comment_155418" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T10:52:59+00:00" title="July  8, 2008 10:52AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adding a tangent:<br/><br/>That thread about Stake Setting that I linked to is, in two-year hindsight, FASCINATING.<br/><br/>Today, people know and understand that not every game that comes out of the indie community has to have Stakes setting.

You liked to my thread on the Forge.  That thread probably demonstrates most of the confusions I was having with MC better than I did here, actually... since that was written when it was happening.  I had forgotten how many confusions it all actually caused with me.<br/>Still, I thought it was going to work out.  I think it could even work okay with me, but it wasn't totally clicking and my friends (one in particular) had a HUGE problem with it.  We probably could have worked around it or tweaked it a little to better suit our purposes, but in the end we just decided to move on to something else.  I do, after all, still have a massive stack of games I haven't run/played yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
