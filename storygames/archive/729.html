                    Doing dishes today while thinking about my Game Chef game, I had this idea using the ingredients: law, steel, and team. 1 session of 2 hours. The same ones I used for PEQ.<br/>
<br/>
Steel Union<br/>
<br/>
A game about union workers and their bosses.  The game is divided into two teams and maybe three: The Man, the teamsters, the scabs. The goal of the game is different for all three teams: For The Man, the goal is to make as much steel as possible while spending as little as money as possible. For the teamsters, it's to use the law to halt production of steel until their wages are raised as high as possible, and for the scabs it's to make money while producing as much steel as they can.  All teams have a set of 100 or so laws that often contradict each other to use in conflicts, probably cards or something that can be bought with wages. There would have been events that could have been played. Media coverage. Strikes. Picket lines. Negotiation tables.<br/>
<br/>
The game is played in turns and at the end of each turn points are awarded. The winner is the team with the most steel at the end.<br/>
<br/>
The slogan is Let's Make Steel, Boyz.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else had ideas about games that could have been entered?                </div>

                            Huh, I just went back to look at my brainstorming notes from Game Chef, and I have no idea what in the world I was thinking for some of them.  I mean, "Giant mecha rental franchise?"  "Exponential Borges time structure?"<br/><br/>I do rather like the concept about playing the stunt doubles for superheroes.  The idea is that the superteam goes off to save the world - but someone has to show up at benefit lunches, pose for pictures with schoolchildren, etc.  I'm not sure where the conflict in this idea is, which is part of why I didn't develop it, but it definitely entertained me.  (I think the words were going to be actor and team, not sure about law/steel.)<br/><br/>Then there was the "Play out the last eight hours before the end of the world" scenario, which was inspired by ... dammit, I can't remember the name, but some classic sci-fi story where something bad happens to the sun and people realize that when their part of the world rotates into sunlight, they're going to be fried to a crisp.  The idea would be to try to deal with the Imminent Destruction of Everything while everyone around you is basically panicking, so you're trying to get home so you can spend your last minutes with your family but the streets are gridlocked and everyone's drinking themselves senseless.  Then I decided that might be too depressing to be fun, and anyhow I had no idea how to connect the words to it.<br/><br/>Giant mecha rental franchise, though ... that could be fun.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p><em>Mere Sapnon ki Rani</em> was nearly a GC game, but it was too onerous to incorporate the terms; I was working with rules restrictions only, and so it didn't fit.</p>
<p>I had some idea about doing a yearly series of games, a <em>Snow From Korea</em> for each Game Chef, necessarily reinterpreting and transforming the content each time, but always bending it around a vaguely continuous theme of strained samurai love.</p>

                            I'd thought about a game called <i>The Gay Recruitment Squad Wants YOU!</i>.<br/>
<br/>
The PCs were elite gay recruitment operatives, dispatched around the world to persuade people to turn homosexual. They'd get a report on their radios (for example, about a college quarterback singing Barbara Streisland in the showers) and they'd work out a plan to "turn" him.<br/>
<br/>
It was going to be Team and Steel (for the steel handcuffs and restraint gear they used) and, um, Law, maybe, in some sense?<br/>
<br/>
There was going to be a GM and a Sergeant (one of the PCs) and the Sergeant would lead the players in chants (e.g. "Pink Fist!" and "What's the difference between a straight boy and a bisexual?" "FOUR BEERS!").<br/>
<br/>
I hadn't worked out the mechanics, except that playing cards would be used and Queens would have some special function.<br/>

                            I wanted to write a game using the ten one hour sessions deal where each session starts at the same time, where the main character (who rotates from player to player) is about to face some horrible crisis.  The other player portray forces pushing the protagonist to crisis, and are trying to force the protagonist toward their unhappy ending.                        </div>

                            I was going to do a series of ten small (one hour) scenarios based off of the "Glass, Ancient, Emotion" grouping.  The premise was that the Snow Queen's (<b>ancient</b> adversary) distorted mirror (<b>glass</b>) had been leaving shards in the eyes and hearts (<b>emotion</b>) of various fairy tale figures (with some influence from the Fables comic) and the players were going to need to solve these mysteries.  Then I realized it wasn't a game, just a set of scenarios, so I finished writing them up and decided I'd find a system and run it for a kids group someday.                        </div>
