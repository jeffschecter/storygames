I think it's a great design technique that he's getting at, but I feel that it's ultimate significance is starting to get a bit exaggerated.<br/><br/>So here's an alternate challenge---rather than worry if so-and-so system has teeth to "force" particular player behaviors, why don't we try thinking about design structures that are flexible enough to handle multiple play-styles?<br/><br/>I'm feeling unimaginative, so I'm going to revert to talking about my own game. In <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, individual conflicts are fairly meaningless in-and-of-themselves. The real significance of isolated conflicts---generally speaking---is that they provide fodder for the stew of inter-party relationships.<br/><br/>What that means is that you can have a fictionally nuanced conflict followed by a shallow mechanicallistic conflict, and both will add meaningful content to the larger dramatic tension. Players can tailor the conflict experience to fit their individual preferences, and the larger game won't be affected (generally speaking).<br/><br/>There are certainly larger play techniques that will break the game if they're not followed, but because the mechanics only <i>*indirectly*</i> affect the larger dramatic tension, individual groups have quite a bit flexibility in how they interpret IIEE and such.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233013/#Comment_233013" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T10:37:00+00:00" title="September 18, 2009 10:37AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim,<br/><br/>What do you mean exactly by multiple play-styles?

I even drew up a diagram:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.storyprov.com/stuff/DitVvstMW.png"/><br/><br/>In DitV (and IaWA?), the on-going dramatic tension emerges <i>*entirely*</i> out of the game's moment-to-moment fiction. Because of that, there <i>must</i> be a strong interplay between mechanics and (moment-to-moment) fiction, otherwise things would feel disjointed.<br/><br/>It's different with tMW, though. In tMW, a large chunk of the dramatic tension is caused by the interaction between the Trust mechanics and Dark Fates. Because of that, the game doesn't <i>require</i> a strong interplay of (moment-to-moment) fiction and mechanics the same way DitV does. Even shallow, mechanicallistic play (within reason) gets fed into the dramatic tension, which in turn gets bounced down into the moment-to-moment fiction, connecting everything together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233087/#Comment_233087" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T14:37:33+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  2:37PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim, that really rings true to me. In a way, mechanics like those can work like dramatic irony. We can see something that might not be evident to the characters. We see it in the mechanics. They can also work like subtext. We see something the characters also see, but that's not said straight out, but rather implied. Both of those ways of working with the mechanics can add a lot of depth to a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233105/#Comment_233105" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T16:14:49+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  4:14PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim,<br/><br/>I think you're right on with the idea that a game doesn't have to have players engaging with mechanics in the heavy-duty way that Dogs (for example) does. I really like mechanics like that, but you're right in that not *every* game needs that kind of system. There are other ways of making/playing a cool game.<br/><br/>The Mountain Witch is a good example of just such a game. BUT ... having read the text a number of times (and having had the chance to play in a few sessions with you recently), I definitely think that tMW and games like it require more from the designer *and* the players.  <br/><br/>For example, In A Wicked Age runs along pretty good by itself, whether you have players heavily invested in the overall drama of the story or not. The Mountain Witch, on the other hand, needs all hands on deck. Both are great games. But I can think of people I've played the former with who I might not be excited about playing the latter with.<br/><br/>Is that what you're getting at? Or at least along the right track?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233145/#Comment_233145" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T20:56:44+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  8:56PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know, Tim - when someone pulls a gun on you and you know, mechanically, that you'll be sucking down some d10 fallout, that seems like mechanical tension.

Without that, the gun doesn't have as much fictional tension.</blockquote>\nDave,<br><br>A gun pointed at your face certainly introduces "tension", but I would say that's a tension in the "moment-to-moment", not the "on-going".<br/><br/>"Dramatic tension" is probably not the best phrase to use, but right now I'm having a hard time coming up with something better. ("Play tension"? "Story-" or "play-dynamic"? I don't know.) Here's what I mean:<br/><br/>In DitV, on-going play is informed by an emergent sense of morality, right? <i>What does the player think is right &amp; wrong, and how far are they willing to pursue it?</i> This sense of morality is generally informed by the events of the moment-to-moment fiction, but I don't see how mechanics (directly) play into that question at all. The Dogs have both the fictional authority and mechanical power to do whatever they want, so it seems to me that the decision of what's right/wrong/etc is totally up to the player.<br/><br/>I am NOT saying that DitV's mechanics are divorced from the "on-going dramatic tension", what I'm proposing is that there's a chain of events. The mechanics inform the moment-to-moment fiction, which in turn inform the "on-going tension". (And the chain works in the opposite direction as well.)<br/><br/>In tMW, there is a particular "play tension" caused by, or at least exaggerated by, the interplay of the Trust mechanics and Dark Fates: <i>The ronin have to trust one another for mechanical reasons, but can't trust one another for fictional reasons.</i> So unlike DitV, there is direct link between the mechanics and the "on-going tension".<br/><br/>Now, the idea that has emerged from this thread (for me, at least) is that in order for a game to feel "coherent"---and I mean that in the normal sense, not the jargon-y sense---the game must link up those three bubbles in some sort of chain.<br/><br/>Since DitV has a missing or weak link on the right side of the triangle, maintaining the bottom link is crucial, hence all the "IIEE w/ teeth" talk. (Is this also the case with IaWA? I'm not familiar with how exactly that game works.)<br/><br/>Since tMW has a strong link on both the right and left, it can get away with a weak link on the bottom.<br/><br/>(Are there games with strong bottom and right links, but a missing or weak link on the left? I haven't really thought about it, but I suspect some tactical RPGs might work that way.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233181/#Comment_233181" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-19T08:08:47+00:00" title="September 19, 2009  8:08AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian,<br/><br/>I think we're talking about different things.

The idea is that in DitV, you can't make mechanical decisions without a clear understanding of the (moment-to-moment) fictional context, and vice versa. But in tMW, a strong link between the mechanical and the (moment-to-moment) fiction isn't always required. Sometimes you do stuff that's purely fictional, and sometimes you do stuff that's purely mechanical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233554/#Comment_233554" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T19:39:19+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  7:39PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite><br/>I think we're talking about different things.
