Roll!<br/>Player: What do I roll?<br/>GM: This is a Healing skill check; skill checks are 2d4.<br/>Player: Okay.  (Shakes dice.  Rolls.)  Five.<br/>GM: Cool.  For you, you do an average job.<br/>Player: So, what happens?<br/>GM: You stop the bleeding.</span><br/><br/>This is supposed to support (or at least not interfere with) immersion.  One friend complained that his immersion was broken by the process of figuring out which dice to roll, shaking them without a target number in mind, reading the "5" without knowing whether that was good enough, and waiting for the GM's response.<br/><br/>So, this weekend at Ubercon, I did it a little differently:<br/><br/><span style="color: #000066;">Player: I try to stop the bleeding!<br/>GM: Okay, the wound is pretty nasty!  For most people, this would be a 50-50 shot!  With your "pro" healing skill, though, it's not too hard.  Roll the same 2d6 we roll for everything,<br/>Player: Five.<br/>GM: Just a bit below average.  Quite sufficient to stop the bleeding.</span><br/><br/>It went over fine.  Which proves nothing, but is at least one data point.  I'm curious if folks here have a significantly different reaction to these two processes.  <b>Which seems more compatible with maintaing a character POV?<br/></b><br/>Further, would it make a difference if you had either of the following charts in front of you?<br/><br/># - HOW HARD?<br/><span style="color: #000066;">3-4 - not too<br/>5-6 - somewhat<br/>7-8 - 50-50<br/>9-10 - extremely<br/>11-12 - near-impossible</span><br/><br/># - HOW HARD?<br/><span style="color: #000066;">3 - near-automatic<br/>4 - not too<br/>5 - somewhat<br/>6 - significantly<br/>7 - 50-50<br/>8 - very<br/>9 - extremely<br/>10 - incredibly<br/>11 - near-impossible<br/>12 - theoretically possible</span><br/><br/>I'm curious about how much different tastes and thinking styles will vary on this subject.  In Delve, players are supposed to get all the info they want <i>before</i> acting, which is entirely sufficient for me.  As long as I don't fail easy-seeming tasks on good rolls, or succeed at difficult tasks with low rolls, then I'm fine.  But apparently not everyone thinks like I do on this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielZKlein" title="DanielZKlein"><img alt="DanielZKlein" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielZKlein">DanielZKlein</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299875/#Comment_299875" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T16:43:02+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  4:43PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I play something where rolls simulate the success or failure of my actions (which isn't all that often anymore), I really like knowing what I'm rolling for. Even better, I like having the same targets every time, with difficulty modeled through a modifier to my ROLL (not to the target score). FATE's Fudge Dice system comes to mind ("you're going to need a Superb result to do this"), or even Apocalypse World's roll+ (where you always roll 2d6 and add a value between -3 and +3 to the roll). AW feels especially good because you always have the same sort of target: 10+ is always "great, worked just like you wanted to", 7-9 is always "you succeed BUT" and 6 and below is always a miss (which means that something ELSE interesting happens). <br/><br/>I would definitely err on the side of less granularity; AW's miss/hit-with-complications/hit feels just right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299876/#Comment_299876" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T17:03:09+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  5:03PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, thanks for the feedback.

I'll just do it) simulationist games very often. I still do from time to time. And when I do, I would say it's the search/thought time that goes into it that most affects my immersion.<br/><br/>The difference is really in how long I spend outside of "I am my character" mode. When I need to do anything more involved with numbers--say when I have to adjust my target number--or when I need to do more than basic interpretation with the result, I spend time in metagame mode. Using Fudge again, let's say: <br/><br/>"Okay, so my GM told me this needs a +4. I'm using Guns, which I have at +2, okay. I rolled a + + - 0, so +1. That's +3. Now I invoke "Patient Zero Must Die!", so that's a +5. Okay, cool, I hit!"<br/><br/>This means I just spent x seconds thinking about stuff from a level that's definitely higher than my character immersion level. Whereas:<br/><br/>GM: "You seize his head by force? Cool, roll+hard."<br/>Me: *rolls 5 5. +2: 12* "I rolled a 12, so I suffer little harm, inflict terrible harm, and frighten or dismay my enemies!"<br/>GM: "Cool, this is what happens..."<br/><br/>In example one, I had to find exactly where my target was, based on my skill level and the difficulty level. Then there were additional considerations. Example 2, I rolled, I knew I was aiming for 7 (or better yet, 10), and that was that. The difference for me is really just in search length. Even though it doesn't seem like a big deal, I think I'd prefer your first table in the long run.<br/><br/>I keep trying to think if any other aspect arising from these tables would harm my immersion, but I can't think of one. This is really dull, but for me it seems to boil down to how long I'm forced to leave the "I am my character" mindset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299898/#Comment_299898" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T19:37:27+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  7:37PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, that's not dull at all, to me.  Thanks for explaining.  I agree that your Fudge example involves too much processing.  Neither of my Delve examples have any of that.  <br/><br/>As for Delve vs AW, my first thought is that the only difference in handling time stems from which game a given player is more familiar with.  But maybe I'm missing something, and "add +Healing, subtract 2 for extreme difficulty, do the math, roll, and hope for a 7-9 or 10+" is easier on some part of the brain than "let me describe why it's Very Hard, now roll and hope for at least the Very Hard number of 8"???<br/><br/>Lula, yeah, I'm with you on the muddy descriptors.  The main reason I went for granularity was so that each level meant a specific target number; on the first table "you need to do something Somewhat hard" could mean "you need a 5" or "you need a 6".  Maybe I should just use 2d4 instead of 2d6...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299901/#Comment_299901" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T19:54:56+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  7:54PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts listed in the order they occur to me and based on my preferences when my "playing in this mode of play" settings are turned on:<br/><br/>1) Saying "Ok, roll Healing" is preferred to "Ok, roll", "so what do I roll?"  If I'm deep in character headspace (which is a place I don't normally play but sometimes do and am assuming for these comments) remembering skill names and what to roll for what is one of those grain-of-sand-irritants that wind up disproportionately annoying.  If your skill list is suitably defined and not obnoxiously duplicative (like say having 16 different skills for persuading someone) the GM should be able to announce on the fly what skill is appropriate without trouble.<br/><br/>2) Knowing that "pretty nasty" = 50/50 shot for untrained people and "pro" training makes things easier is good to know at the beginning of play for context, but I don't want to know that for each roll.  If you're using a 2d6 die roll, any gamer worth their salt already knows what the odds curve looks like.  <br/><br/>3) Just tell me the target number.  "its not too hard" "ok I rolled a 5" "that's enough" is another one of those grain-of-sand irritants for me.  Just say "Roll healing, you need a 5".  My brain can auto process 5 on 2d6 = not too hard way quicker and less intrusively than doing the back and forth thing.  An advantage of having and easy to parse dice system that you might as well take advantage of.<br/><br/>4) Like Lula I'm not a fan of the overly granular version of the table.  But better than making the numbers ranges like in the first version of the table, just leave some of the lines blank.  In other words, the table goes from 2-12 but only 4 or 5 of the rows are filled in.  I can see for myself that 4 is "not to hard" therefore 3 must be a little easier than that and 5 a little harder than that without needing new labels.  Also, isn't 6-7 50% on 2d6  6 being 42% and 7 being 58%?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299902/#Comment_299902" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T19:55:43+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  7:55PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, <br/>It sounds like the problem comes from simply not knowing. I find that games with the tightest resolution and handling time are ones that have either a unified mechanic, or a small set of uniform mechanics (as in, each one is relatively consistent in itself). <br/>For me, AW is superior because, like you said in your initial example, the player knows the target number right away. There's a loss of connection to the fiction, perhaps, when the player sets the dice down and waits for someone else's ruling.<br/>Rather than a math-brain vs. language brain problem, knowing what to expect or hope for while rolling the dice or what-have-you. Like someone said in another thread recently, the tension comes not from wondering what the outcome might be, but having some kind of idea what it WILL be - and I think having a standard target number to ALWAYS get, period, counts as being able to form specific expectations. <br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299914/#Comment_299914" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T20:47:42+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  8:47PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac, that is really helpful.  Thanks!<br/><br/>Ralph, <br/><br/>1) Agreed, wondering what to roll blows.  I'm warming to the idea of one mechanic for all rolls.  GM already calls out relevant skills; I pondered giving the GM a list of every PC skill ranking, so the players don't even need to remember or look up "pro"... but the GM has a lot of tasks already...<br/><br/>2-3) Man, we think totally differently on this.  I want some visuals and other in-character impressions!  Hearing "you need a 5" does tell me my odds, but skips right past my in-character experience of confronting them.  Your response (which is identical to Deliverator Matt's) just baffles me.  I love imagining details, but "58% chance of success" doesn't help me do that; it actually gets in the way, because that's not how I experience real life.  Real life, for me, is usually either "doesn't seem that hard, but I need to be sure not to screw up" or "no idea" or "likely impossible, but I'll give it a shot".  Gah.  Maybe leaving task performance to a roll of dice is inherently anti-immersive in that respect.<br/><br/>4) Both charts are based on the idea that the GM doesn't say "you need a 5".  Instead, the players get fiction first ("it looks Somewhat hard") and numbers second ("I need a 5") from GM/chart at first and then from memory eventually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299915/#Comment_299915" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T20:48:46+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  8:48PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Zac and Valamir and Lula said, essentially.

I don't need or want "58%".  That kind of false precision drives me nuts for entirely different reasons.  But what I do need/want is to get from "what am I trying to do" through "evaluate how difficult it is" to "make a decision" and onto "what actually happened" as quickly as possible.  I'm pretty sure, that's right in line with what you need/want too.<br/><br/>So for me, the most appealing option is the one that requires the fewest steps, the least back and forth with the GM, and least amount of my brain power needing to process.  <br/><br/>Where I think we may be different is here:  given the choice between the experience of imagining details during this process vs. getting through the process as quickly and painlessly as possible so I can get back to imaging the important stuff...I'm going to pick the latter nearly every time.  In others words..."doesn't seem that hard but I need to be sure not to screw up" is how I imagine the real world too...but that takes longer to process so my preference is "don't waste my time making me translate real world speak into game speak and then back to real world speak...just give me the damn number.  My brain can imagine details far faster than you can describe them anyway.<br/><br/>And THAT, now that I think about it...is probably the biggest single immersion enhancing thing you can do...speed.  The human brain processes an amazing amount of information very quickly.  Far more quickly than the spoken word can begin to fill.  That's why my attention wanders when GM's read flavor text outloud.  Listening to flavor text occupies like...i don't know 1/3 of my brain...the rest is racing on to other stuff cuz there's nothing there to occupy it.  If I've got to listen to flavor text I'd much rather it be handed to me in writing so I can read it in about 1/10 the time it would take the DM to read it aloud.  <br/><br/>So every part of your system that slows down the information flowing into my brain, leaves opportunities for my brain to decide to do something else while I'm waiting.  Saying "you need to roll a 5" is thus more immersive than "not too hard" for me because the amount of real world game space time is less...thus less time to get distracted by insufficient game input.<br/><br/>That's the first time I've tried to articulate this point in writing, so hopefully that made sense.  I don't know how universal this is, however.  I tend to be the guy mentally making circular motions with my hand and thinking "come on, speed this up, get to the point already, I'm bored"<br/><br/>As an example, if there is going to be a dialog between two characters, I often (not always, but often) find it more immersive to quickly summarize in the 3rd person what the conversation was about then to actually roleplay out word for word the dialogue.  Why?  Because in my brain, my brain is filling in the word for word dialogue FAR faster than we could actually have our mouths form the words.  That's less true with players who are skilled at improv and familiar enough with their characters to have entire conversations in their character's voice without breaking a sweat.  But at lesser levels of ability where players are hunting for their character's voice...i'd rather just skip to the end and let my brain fill in the voice...same as I do when I read a novel and the author summarizes a conversation without putting the whole dialog in quotes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299924/#Comment_299924" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T21:59:56+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  9:59PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>"doesn't seem that hard but I need to be sure not to screw up" is how I imagine the real world too...but that takes longer to process so my preference is "don't waste my time making me translate real world speak into game speak and then back to real world speak...just give me the damn number.

And so I've gotten used to it.  And so I've learned to enjoy it.  I know you aren't suggesting that people charge ahead blindly without communicating... but what are you suggesting?  That facts and actions and outcomes get communicated, but not color?  Or that color is communicated when it adds something, but it tends not to add something in standard task resolution die rolls?<br/><br/>You mentioned "getting back to the important stuff" -- so, in all this, are you talking about <i>unimportant</i> die rolls?  I speed through those by not doing them.  If it's not important, whatever the GM makes up will suffice.  When it <i>is</i> important, when big things hinge on a moment of chance, is my favorite time to both (a) slow down and communicate color, and (b) roll dice.<br/><br/>(I should admit that I will occasionally ask for low-consequence rolls out of habit as a way to let players show off character strengths...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299946/#Comment_299946" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T01:28:27+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  1:28AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm probably not that immersive of a player, but it really breaks my vision of the fiction when I don't know what I'm rolling ahead of time, when I can't look at the dice and know whether I succeeded or not.  I think this can/should accompany descriptions of: "oh this isn't too hard, you need a 4".  But the number assures we're on the same page about what's going on in the fiction ("oh, I didn't realize the wall was THAT high"), or even about what the odds are (some people aren't great at math).  I think that's part of what Ralph/Valamir is getting at.  Spitting out the number can much more quickly communicate some information.  Compare: <br/>"The wall's pretty high, definitely not easy, but doable. You'll need a 10 on 2d6." <br/>with: <br/>"The wall is ten feet high, roll (rolls a 9). You're able to get up the wall a bit, but you keep slipping before you can reach the top."  <br/>"What?  it's only ten feet high, that's easy!"  <br/>"Have you ever tried to climb a ten foot high brick wall?  It's harder than you think."<br/><br/>So, of your initial examples I don't really like either, but prefer the second.  At least I could infer that I need something less than 7.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299979/#Comment_299979" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T06:02:53+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  6:02AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite> <br/>But doesn't the<i>shared</i>aspect of RPG fiction render this impossible?

I unfortunately never numbered them for easy reference as Holmes did back in the day:-)<br/><br/>But I've often said that in any given RPG the unshared imaginary space is way way way bigger than the shared imaginary space.<br/><br/>Take for example a chase scene:  "You're running down a dingy street on the fringe of the commercial district.  Its early morning so there's not too many people, mostly just vendors getting ready for the day"  That's a pretty reasonable phrase for an area the action is just passing through.  And it has just enough touchpoints to ensure that we're on the same page on the meaningful stuff.  But now...each of us has a visual image of that street in our heads...and there ain't no way its the same, and aside from the stated details might not even be similar.  We're all drawing visual imagery from our own experience.  Someone who lives/lived in a big city like NYC or Chicago is probably populating that street with references to real streets they've walked down.  Others are populating with scenes they've seen on Law and Order.  Whatever.  Most of the time that doesn't matter, and I'm sure is pretty obvious stuff.<br/><br/>But what that means is that the movie playing in my head about our game is never ever going to be the same as the movie playing in your head.  At best it will be like two movies made by different film schools from the same sketchy script.  Similar enough to be recognized, but ultimately never even all that close.  Armed with that realization it became clear to me that the Shared Imaginary Space is kind of like the new D&amp;D setting...just a handful of points of light surrounded by wilderness.  The lights being the shared part.<br/><br/>I've come to decide that the killer app of TTRPGing is to treat this as a FEATURE not something to be minimized.  Cuz if your goal is to minimize the unshared bits and maximize the shared bits then we'd be better off playing MMORPGS where what that street looks like is absolutely identical for each of us because its drawn in real time in hi res graphics, and there's never any doubt who's positioned where.  Since that sort of shared space is always going to be superior on a computer than on the table top, IMO at the table its best to go the other way and embrace the unshared part as not only unavoidable but something to be enjoyed.  In that sense I'd much prefer imagining my own street than having to sit through a detailed description of yours.  Not because my street is better, but because the processing time to imagine a street is more akin to the processing time to "take in" a real street vs. the much slower processing time to talk about it.  Imagining my own is thus more immersive to me.<br/><br/>Of course, this comes with the corrolary of being perfectly willing to modify on the fly what the video of my street looks like as new elements of it become shared.<br/><br/><br/>When I referred to the "Important Stuff" I meant the consequences of the roll, the reactions of others, etc vs determining the difficulty of the roll or what skill to use.  I was assuming most of your rolls were "important" but to me the important stuff of the roll is what happens as a result and taking time to wonder how hard "not too hard" actually is, is just delaying getting to that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299986/#Comment_299986" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T06:31:08+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  6:31AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>But I've often said that in any given RPG the unshared imaginary space is way way way bigger than the shared imaginary space.</blockquote>\nI agree with this completely! <br/><br/>In the games I've been visiting (<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13314" rel="nofollow">details here</a>), it's pretty clear that shared imaginary space isn't even important to many people and not required to feel immersed.

I think that there are other techniques, too - describing exact distances, colors, and props - that can help as well.<br/><br/>In my experience, though, a great deal of what's going on isn't really explicitly relevant to play - it's key to know if someone has a particular object in hand, maybe, but beyond a few particularly relevant details, the world can just kind of swirl around the characters without issue. As a pretty hard-line Story Now fan, I'm sure this reflects my own preferences, but I'm only ejected from my sort of immersion when I'm engaged emotionally or mentally by something entirely not-the-game; there isn't a lot that play can do to eject me. <br/>Part of that is having one foot in the action, and one foot on the bleachers, watching everything like a spectator - but that's a feature of my Stance: I drift between Author and Pawn, the latter arising when I get an idea for something I want to introduce to play, but I'm thinking pretty firmly in terms of "This needs to happen; I don't care if it makes perfect sense for <i>my</i> pc to do it".<br/><br/>I suppose what I'm saying here isn't as relevant if explicit immersion in the events of play is someone's number one priority, or close to it. But just because someone is interested in Sim play, that doesn't restrict what Stances they may fall into, whatsoever - in fact, I think it's critical to make clear that "immersionism" is not 1:1 the same as Sim play, and if you have any kind of GMful responsibilities/powers in a game, you're going to be operating on two mental levels, anyway - since you have to get the fiction "right", you're going to switch between "what would my character think?" and "how do i describe NIMH correctly?" I think it's possible for a really strident Actor stance to (potentially) clash with a Sim agenda, also - just because "my guy would do it" doesn't mean it captures the genre or setting correctly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300072/#Comment_300072" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T11:45:33+00:00" title="November  9, 2010 11:45AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph,<br/><br/>I dunno, maybe I've been GMing immersive games too much and not playing them enough.  But I love when someone else shares color.<br/><br/>Yeah, we all have our separate movies going on.  Cool.  No problem.  That's certainly better than thinking about lunch or errands or other real life shit.  And, like you said, as long as you're willing to edit your vision on the fly when someone else talks, the social part of the game isn't damaged.  <br/><br/>However, I know that my movies concentrate heavily on the stuff I'm thinking of interacting with.  And before I <i>do</i> interact with it, I've gotta get it straight with the GM or whoever.<br/><br/>Accordingly, as a player, I tend to form provisional visions and speak in leading questions.  "Is there a fire escape I could maybe climb?  Are the vendors burdened down with wares and easy to shiv?  Are there any seagulls for my augury?"<br/><br/>Among these visions of "maybe" and "what if", I find it very satisfying to both give and receive definite color.  "As I walk past the fire, the light glints menacingly off my scar!"  Sweet!  That specific portion of my movie just popped into focus, extreme close up, hi-res, pro lighting.  And it's fun to reciprocate!  "I gun my apple core into the fire before clenching my teeth and lifting my sword!"  Socially, we just shared our enthusiasm for imagining this grim scene, with all the mutual appreciation that's play's primary reward.<br/><br/>Anyway.  I suspect we agree that there are times when shared color is nice, and other times when the speed of speech hinders immersed experience.  Perhaps the point of contention is whether a dice-requiring task resolution is likely to be one or the other?<br/><br/>Or am I missing some implications of what you wrote?
