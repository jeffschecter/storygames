As it's a lot of improvising in running games AW-style, it could be handy to have some hot&amp;spicy cyberpunk motives at hand for quick use during the session, especially operator-like arrangements, which are more interesting and deeper than simple: bring information, kill/kidnap/protect someone, etc. I would be grateful if you post some interesting cyberpunk-color ideas to use in order to make character's lives interesting. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are going to have Infofixer (Operator-based) and his crew, consisting of Solo (gunlugger-based), Infiltrator (a little bit of battlebabe, but mostly new, spy-like character role) and Ripperdoc (Angel&amp;Savvy merge). Setting is more-or-less CP2020 Night City (but Night City as an idea rather, than locations map from some sourcebooks, so there are corporations, gangs, combat zone, etc., most of it detailed during the sessions, AW-style.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I'm looking for some interesting ideas for standalone motives to use quickly for Infofixer gigs outcomes, maybe weaving them into fronts&amp;threats I have afterwards, maybe not. Some examples:<br/>\n<br/>\n1] Gang-contact has a important and express Ripperdoc job, explained as "removing some piece of shit out of someone, quickly" - sounds pretty regular, like patching some ganger, maintaining some piece of malfunctioning cyberware or something like this. When they show up, it turns up they brought some guy, definitely NOT their fellow, corp looking, and need our doc to remove a memory chip from his brain or something like this. Possible story hooks to fill during the game and/or weaving into existing fronts :<br/>\n- who's this guy?<br/>\n- what's on this chip and why the gangers want it?<br/>\n- what would gangers do, if players refuse to do it or try to ask for more information?<br/>\n<br/>\n2] Some reporter is hiring someone (maybe PC's, maybe their allies, maybe someone else) to help in gathering intel about corps, gangs or whatever else, including body-guarding, access find assistance, that kind of crap, anything that would require employer stay close to employees. In fact, the job they were hired to is just a distraction, and in fact reporter is composing material about the employees. Now,<br/>\n- will PC realize what is happening<br/>\n- who the reporter really works for? <br/>\n- is he some sort of spy, or dedicated journalist, seeking hot material?<br/>\n- will he willingly or unwillingly endanger them?<br/>\n<br/>\n3] Corp customer is seeking some information, at first it looks as some mundane reasearch data, explained as needed for science purposes. It involves spying on oridinary people, living in appointed area (not under the corp jurisdiction and propbably not so safe, so the corpo is hiring contactors), preparing some details on their behaviour, nothing harmful.<br/>\n- what is the real reason the corp is seeking these kind information, were the spied people some kind of test subjects?<br/>\n- is the customer really acting according his corp duty, or is cooking some private arrangement?<br/>\n- what if appointed people will gone missing some time after the deal with customer is done?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
