The campaign will have a Sword and Sorcery vibe set in "Tol-na-Grondh" a massive ancient city set on the coast and ruled by some of the last of the Sorcerer Kings.  Think Fafhrd and Gray Mouser fun, with a little Elric (high magic) thrown in, but not as morose.  <br/><br/>We have:<br/><br/>"Black" Alice - a spooky widow that speaks to her dead husband, on a quest to learn about his death and to find her children<br/><br/>Graham Bannion - a playwright, actor, dilatante, with a secret association to the Lamplighter vigilantes<br/><br/>Bane - an ex-noble, weather warlock, rogue scholar, with way to much morals for the desires of his heart<br/><br/>Czarina - Bane's sister, a noble, temple knight/guardian, trying to salvage her brothers name<br/><br/>Chompontli - disgraced lesser sorcerer prince, made outcast by killing his brother and his uncle's guile, now back to prove his righteousness.<br/><br/>Kostya - Northern barbarian, last of his tribe, repaying an oath of protection so he can get on with an oath of vengeance<br/><br/>If interested check it out at <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7500" rel="nofollow">The Burning Wheel Forums</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
