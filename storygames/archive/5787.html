So, I dropped them both a line and we are going to get together over skype and play BW.<br/><br/>Rock!<br/><br/>After a long hiatus and one particularly shitty game, the Houses of the Blooded posse met again and played a great session with duels, High Revenge, notes written in blood, writhing disembodied hands and poisoned brothers.  Good stuff.<br/><br/>I got together with some friends I haven't seen since the summertime and played Shock: after we sat down and caught up.  We created this wonderful setting where the aliens from Vega were coming to save earth.  Turns out the Vegans (vay-guns not Vee-gans) were condescending pricks.

It has generated awesome results.<br/><br/>Today I got paid to play Ticket to Ride. Last week (I'm a community support worker) involved two cases of assault, and I'm just so relieved and ecstatic at the abrupt turn around and the fact that I really enjoyed work today. Rock.<br/><br/>I just had a fun SotC character creation session. Blackleaf, African Cheetah Warrior! (I know, totally not PC.

Or maybe baby will decide to preempt all that awkwardness, do a self-caesarean and come out fighting.  <br/><br/>Our party's dwarven thief has been under a lot of strain lately, and is having mental health issues.  "Ask your doctor about trepanation," we've been telling him, but I don't think he's that interested in being cured.<br/><br/>Also, our wizard's samples have escaped their containment and are now roaming around our shared house.

I've been to Conpulsion in Edinburgh a couple of times from the CCG side and its a great con.

I cannot think of a better way to spend the Easter weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy wife (bless her!) has told me that she has had a premonition (her family are all spiritualists and believe in that stuff. For once, I'm willing to let it ride) that I must go to GenCon again this year. Apparently something important will happen and I have to be there. Well, who the hell am I to argue!

I know that some people are wary over FFG (they have a bit of a habit for extreme slippage in release dates if nothing else) but remember these were the guys who put out the much acclaimed Midnight setting for D20.  So there's some serious hope there.<br/><br/>I played in my first session of a new D&amp;D 3.5 campaign last night and it was great fun.  It was pretty typical D&amp;D fare but man it's been too long.  Sometimes you just want to create a techy character (spiked chain fighter goodness), kill things and take their stuff.  What's even better is that it is with 3 people (one of whom has never roleplayed before and loved it) who I only just met.  My regular group contains 3 people, none of whom (including me) like to GM so finding someone who was happy to do it has been a revelation and I'm so happy to be getting in some face-to-face roleplaying again.<br/><br/>Not only that but I've rediscovered the motivation to work on my game, Anarchy and have been getting somewhere with it.<br/><br/>All in all a damn fine couple of weeks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129724/#Comment_129724" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T10:24:38+00:00" title="February 23, 2008 10:24AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I figured out escalation in <em>Agora!</em>  Now I just have to figure out if I want to call it "escalation."

So now no one can trust anyone, and everything is up for grabs. Also, mass adultery! <br/><br/>My Changeling: The Lost game is just getting going. So far its got a good tone and pace, with every scene having a beautiful tinge of madness and beauty, and with every character in the game coming off like an ensemble of beautiful losers from every Cohen song ever. <br/><br/>The Mage: New Version game I'm in finally clicked into stride last session, after several stuttering attempts at getting things moving. We're now hip deep in politics, with every one of the good and noble PCs being exposed as human, faliable, and very much starting to crack under the pressure of their own hubris. <br/><br/>And the sporadic catch as catch can games of Beast Hunters and In A Wicked Age continue, with lots of blood sugar sex magic for all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129983/#Comment_129983" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T13:18:15+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  1:18PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a game of Red Box Hack tonight and Spione on Wednesday.

We played a weird game of Dark Heresy where we all turned out to be elementals from Sapphire and Steel who were, in turn, playing a game of Dark Heresy. It was strange and confusing, and a lot of fun, though my PC killed himself because he thought he had been tained by Chaos when he started displaying all these crazy Sapphire and Steel powers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we played In a Wicked Age and all was good. A kidnapped girl with a leopard's soul, the younger brother of a murderer, and an animated statue of a little boy inhabited by the map of the world found there way to a treasure trove containing a magical crown that turned the map into a real boy. Along the way the ghost of the boy's father found justice, the girl's soul possessed the body of the soul-less leopard, and some hapless treasure hunters realised that their extensive gear was worth more than the treasure they had gone to find <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nI also managed to try out a session of Burning Empires, and Solipsist should be off to the printers any day now <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130096/#Comment_130096" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T01:59:31+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  1:59AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And just as a follow up, we Red Box Hack'd and had a thoroughly enjoyable time.
