There are only a few characters with a speaking role. The atmosphere is amazing. I definitely think you'd need to lay the props and atmosphere on thick. I wonder if anyone out there casts bronze whistles?<br/><br/>Anyone with experiences of doing 1:1 horror stories? What worked? What didn't? What stories did you tell?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302824/#Comment_302824" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T11:02:20+00:00" title="December  1, 2010 11:02AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1:1 horror is totally my fave horror!<br/><br/>worked: quiet space, removed from bustle or anyone not playing so that whispers can carry. Low wattage lamps close to the ground, reminiscent of fires &amp; not the sun. <br/><br/>i don't think fiddly systems work well for horror. Don't Rest Your Head's questions are totally great, i'm not too into the setting or the system of the game, however. But the questions really let us focus in on the particular strangeness and story of this particular woman, a runner (in marathons), who had just moved to a new city and had been sick for a long time. She also had a spotty memory, but not in an Overwrought Amnesiac kind of way, just enough for us to be suspicious about what she remembers. And one night her jaw unhinged and she puked up an exact replica of herself, a duplicate really, who stood (as she herself reeled with dizziness), still covered in phlegm and a little blood, regarded her coolly, and locked herself in the bathroom and proceeded to shower. <br/><br/>The game was scary because our protagonist didn't go buy a gun or try to break down the bathroom door or whatever. She got scared, went running to clear her head, and then got too scared to go home again. She couldn't call the cops, they would think she was crazy. She spent a lot of time considering the implications of what had happened. Of course, the duplicate was slowly taking over her life. It was really awesome.<br/><br/>I think 1:1 horror works well because the person in the protagonist role gets the benefit of no other points of view  - they are alone. And no release from the pressure... i mean, neither player does. THe story only advances with both players' involvement. <br/><br/>thanks for the movie recommendation.<br/><br/><br/>(i wanted to qualify my response that i'm wading deeper and deeper into structured freeform preferences, and care less and less about my character besting others or strategy, etc. I'm assuming that "horror" in this sense refers to atmosphere and scaring the shit out of you and a friend. Not about fighting skeletons instead of orcs. I think we're on the same page, i just wanted to be sure. My opinions may be of little use to you if you're looking to roll dice against vampires. Also, this is not meant to sound like i'm a snob, if it comes across this way. I'm just writing fast 'cause i have to get out of here.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MattJohnston" title="MattJohnston"><img alt="MattJohnston" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cimota.com/slypic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MattJohnston">MattJohnston</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302846/#Comment_302846" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T12:33:13+00:00" title="December  1, 2010 12:33PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The isolation of "they'll think I'm crazy" or "I have no friends here" adds heaps to the personal horror. <br/><br/>I was a player in a game about 20 years ago. I played a streetwise east end kid who had been sent to a remote farm in the Cotswolds owned by a sullen and uncommunicative uncle. I quickly discovered the old lad had recently lost his wife and had, 20 years previous, lost a son. The fact that I was staying in the childs original room...and the child wasn't happy...led to an extremely creepy session. So creepy that we had to take a break when we heard creaking upstairs in the house.<br/><br/>The point of view thing is very important. There's much less room for interpretation, there's almost total immersion, there's no-one present to distract the game with last nights football, the latest shiny RPG hardback or even wondering about where the pizza is.<br/><br/>And yes, we're on the same page.<br/><br/>I just watched S01e05 of The Walking Dead and the sisters scene was very creepy. Very very creepy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
