Still sorting through the intro to what I'm going for with these things on the other thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm aware that I'm leaving a lot out, but I'm not sure what needs to included and what doesn't.  I never mention that you're playing as the characters on a television show, but looking back on it I suppose tv stars is a possible interpretation.  I guess I'm reluctant to give a summary of the game at any point because I want a more off the cuff reaction.  Maybe C+Ving the description of a game from it's website would be sufficient.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny sort of feedback is appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n(looks genre sim.  seems to be implied by the ToC placing Role model shows second only to an intro of the game)<br/>\n<br/>\np 4<br/>\nNot those shows...<br/>\nShows ideal for PTA are: driven by an ensemble cast, delve into the personal lives of a characters, with with a solid premise to provide the week to week excitement<br/>\n(Not hugely familiar with most of these.  Buffy and firefly are pretty much it and buffy I haven't seen in years.)<br/>\n<br/>\np 5<br/>\n(&amp; the wire.  That's pretty much all you needed to say.)<br/>\n<br/>\np 6<br/>\nActual play example<br/>\n(This looks like a trap.  Waiting for me to attribute CA's without proper context.  Also without understanding basic game terminology like what focus: character means.  Just from this it looks like scene length might be a problem, I'm not entirely sure on the role that players w/o characters in a scene play.)<br/>\n<br/>\np 7<br/>\nbasic roles and resources<br/>\nseems like a tradition GM set up<br/>\nsession = an episode<br/>\n(Episode, to me, implies a pretty tight scope on meta-plot advancement.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there going to be enough leeway to allow gamists to gain a tangible advantage?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAre the stark breaks in weekly plot going to detract from the sense of progression that narrativist may bring? <br/>\n<br/>\nIn trying to please the CA's can simulationist get the sort of season ending twists that are a hallmakr of TV?)<br/>\n<br/>\nConflict- decided by a hand of card<br/>\n(Is this pure fortune?  I gotta think that there's more to it than this.)<br/>\n<br/>\nStory arcs- personal and large scale<br/>\n(There's some interesting emergence going here.  I'm really curious to watch how where a character is at a given point in a their personal life affects their response to larger threats.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis concept of a personal struggle seems pretty antithetical to the gamist perspective.  It's a struggle the game believes can change, but can't or shouldn't be solved.  Basically it's staring down a some sort of neurosis treadmill.  The only functional character I could imagine is an extremely eccentric self-help guru.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens if the narrativist isn't where she needs to be?  I mean if you're in a game you understand that there might be some chance of failure, but with the interplay between personal and meta arcs what if you never even have the chance to represent what you want to?  That strikes me as whole nother level of disappointment.  How do we avoid this with interwoven meta-arcs?)<br/>\n<br/>\nFan mail- (shared?) resource to aid players<br/>\n(Pool is a little ambigous here, I don't whether it simply means that a given character has a few call on or if it a shared resource.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell atleast I'm certain gamists won't use these on personal struggles.  I always assume shared resources are going to ratchet up tension, but here that's stripped away, due the games take on personal problems.  Is this a positive channeling of gamist views toward group goals, or does it just offend?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a simulationistist, I'm wondering about characters who the audience likes to see suffer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine that this being a shared resource would tend to help narrativists.  My perception of narrativist definitely fits more squarely in the long term outlook than the other two.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBudget- GM resource<br/>\n<br/>\nTraits<br/>\n<br/>\np 8<br/>\nEdge- personal abillities/ skills/ beliefs<br/>\nConnections- supporting characters who are helpful<br/>\n(Limited resource so there have some gamist appeal.  I don't know where the line between character concept and the character's life revolving around these comes in.  Lacking a sense of scale I don't know how pressed for these one is supposed to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimulationist: My immediate thought with connection over use is allowing the GM a bigger budget would be better fitting.  Having to pay a recurring guest star.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if there is room for the narrativist to seriously involve his connections in plot.)<br/>\n<br/>\nScreen presence- determines scenes and number of cards varies from character to character by episode<br/>\n(Ok, I figured it couldn't be pure fortune.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole relating odds of success to importance in a episode is interesting.  I don't know if I like it.  It feels like it definitely encourages players to make big moves when their at center stage, which is good.  And it likely prevents characters from upstaging an episode's lead.  I definitely dig the A plot/ B plot parallel.  I guess my initial worry over encouraging stagnation or breaking narrative flow for an episode's lesser characters may have been an over reaction.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270890/#Comment_270890" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T04:43:17+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  4:43AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you played PTA?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270933/#Comment_270933" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T09:29:38+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  9:29AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.  A couple things based on my experiences with playing PTA:<br/><br/>Gamist play:  As you surmise, it doesn't offer a lot of support for a Gamist CA.  But it's pretty upfront about it; I know people who have refused to play it out-of-hand because it clearly doesn't offer what they're looking for.<br/><br/>Simulationist play:  This... this is tricky, I think.  PTA does sorta suggest that it supports a Simulationist CA, but I'm not actually sure that's true.  I mean, here's my take on what Simulationist PTA would actually look like:<br/><br/><br/>Director:  We see, from above, a shot of the crime scene, with evidence markers scattered about...<br/><br/>Player:  How'd we get the budget for a crane shot here?<br/><br/>Player 2:  We picked up that sweet advertising from Nike and Gatorade, remember?<br/><br/>Player:  Oh yeah.  Hey, did we roll to see if it was raining during the shoot?  We're still saving money by shooting in Vancouver, aren't we?<br/><br/>Director:  Yep, I rolled that and it's overcast but not actually raining.<br/><br/>Player 3:  I can't believe I spent 6 hours in makeup for this.<br/><br/>Director:  Hey, it's not my fault your out-of-wedlock pregnancy is in full rotation on TMZ and The National Enquirer.  How are those paparazzi rolls going, anyway?<br/><br/><br/>Now, I think a sufficiently motivated playgroup could pull that off with PTA.  I think it'd be awkward, but achievable.<br/><br/><br/>Narrativist play:  This is generally where PTA comes into its own.  Most reports of failure with PTA I've seen have been failures to sufficiently engage with the Spotlight Character's Issue.  The ruleset is perhaps not as explicit here as it could be, but I've seen a fair amount of subsequent advice from the author on this subject.<br/><br/>A lot of other storygames with strong Narrativist support provide the Premise of the game right in the tin.  PTA requires the group as a whole and also each individual character to generate their own Premises, if they're aiming toward a Narrativist CA.<br/><br/><br/>So that's my thoughts on PTA.  My thoughts on your mode of writing... hrm.  I can appreciate you're operating within a limit here.  I guess I think I'd be more interested in seeing those words spent on a narrow, deep analysis than on a broad, shallow analysis.  If it takes you 750 words to talk about Fan Mail, I'm okay with that as an audience member.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270936/#Comment_270936" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T10:14:22+00:00" title="May 13, 2010 10:14AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got to say that your mode of commentary is almost impossible for a reader to follow, unless they're also flipping through the book as they read your "review".<br/><br/>It would be much more interesting and helpful if you explained your thought process, from what's on the page, to your concerns or fears or hopes, or your analysis. Your terse language is very hard to read and understand--I, for one, would only read this if it were a little more polished, and tried a little harder to communicate clearly. It reads like someone's notes on the back of an envelope--maybe meaningful to the author, but totally unclear to any other reader.<br/><br/>Now, a question: How reliable do you think your ability to read about a set of mechanics/rules and make a guess about the resulting gameplay is?

Why sacrifice communication for succintness when you don't have to?<br/><br/>(Anybody who's noticed my predilection for over-long posts will see the irony in the above, I'm sure.)<br/><br/>Anyway, I just wanted to note that Roger's depiction of "simulationistic PTA" is probably a bit exaggerated. There's no reason you couldn't do sim-PTA without delving into the television metaphor any deeper than you do in nar-PTA. In fact, I've had the sort of aggravatingly simulationistic play in Universalis that I imagine sim-PTA would become. The feature I'm thinking of is absolute reign of the genre trope, to such an extent that all contributions to the game are judged on the basis of genre accord. Player characters are stock types, scenes are stock scenes and episode content is ruled not by character issues or character arc, but rather those issues and arc are deliberately chosen to not challenge received wisdom of the genre. Quality of play is measured based on how flawlessly the players manage to duplicate the tropes of the genre. You could basically do PTA like this almost without changing the game text; the only bit that would be absolutely contrary would be defining and resolving conflicts, which in the rules as written almost necessarily requires staking things that genre celebration wouldn't want to stake. Even that could be made to work if the players were careful to specifically choose Issues that are actually allowed and expected within the genre instead of choosing ones they care about themselves.<br/><br/>In substance I concur with Roger, though: PTA is not very interesting if you don't buy into the character issues, and buying into them as a creative participant is pretty much narrativism on the go. It's not a game that would necessarily hamper other CAs that much, but it is supremely minimalistic in many ways: there is nothing there for players who won't buy into the character issues and care about how they're resolved. Basically, any freeformer group used to ignoring game text intention and mechanics will find that PTA is no worse for any CA than any other game they might care to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270939/#Comment_270939" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T10:27:06+00:00" title="May 13, 2010 10:27AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I just wanted to say that, that is the best description of Sim-PtA and indeed genre-fidelity based Sim play I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270944/#Comment_270944" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T10:42:08+00:00" title="May 13, 2010 10:42AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Subverting genre conventions is also a form of Sim.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270945/#Comment_270945" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T10:44:19+00:00" title="May 13, 2010 10:44AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>The feature I'm thinking of is absolute reign of the genre trope, to such an extent that all contributions to the game are judged on the basis of genre accord.</blockquote>I've heard this type of play mentioned before.

Our game was form-perfect wuxia, but I was bored out of my mind: everything in the game entangled me further into the superficial genre, until I could make no choice at all that wasn't a bored elaboration on the tropes and plot cliche of the genre. In hindsight that was a very interesting experience in that I, at least, felt imprisoned by the genre, largely due to Universalis being a pretty sim-friendly game as construed by us at the time. All conflicts in the game were devoid of real interest on my part: here the hero fights some assassins, here he encounters the old master, here the government mandarin talks everybody into accord - whatever, it's all just basically regurgitating the form without any spirit in it. All choices by all players were made out of more or less perfect knowledge of what "is supposed to happen" in this type of story. Somehow the game's structure just trapped us into doing this.<br/><br/>I should note that I'm not trying to say that genre-faithful simulationism is a bad thing; however, it happens to be absolutely maddening when it creeps up on me like that.

Let'say we assume a functional, Participationist version. <br/><br/>Would that fit those criteria? Because I've seen that a lot. Especially in my early gaming years, there was often the understanding that, say, this character was the Aragorn-type, and we were all looking forward to seeing him become King after all, and this dude was the young acolyte Anakin-type wizard, and we all know he's going to go mad from his power, and then the player tries to replicate that sort of scene where the mad wizard turns-evil-but-accidentally-saves-the-day-with-some-spell-gone-wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270952/#Comment_270952" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T11:03:28+00:00" title="May 13, 2010 11:03AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For more positive genre-sim experiences, I'll refer to <i>Dead of Night</i> - that game has never let me down in this regard. I think that the reason for why DoN works so well has to do with the nature of the game's set-up, which encourages the GM to be clever in small ways in affirming and celebrating the genre, and with the tense, organic order of play when the game is actually executed based on that GM prep. It is definitely creative, but that creativity is directed at showing off this cool monster you made, basically. Nothing genre-breaking, nothing narrativistic, just a poetic notion of monstrosity embedded into a first-person's view of a horror movie conceit.<br/><br/>I do agree with David in that the "absolute reign of the genre trope" is probably not that common in practical experience. That is, usually people don't uphold strict genre standards for their play over personal aesthetic judgment. Still, I've seen enough of this to know that it does exist, usually in groups that find coherent Exploration difficult. For instance, I've met anime gamers (the sort who play exclusively BESM or that newer similar game, the name of which I forget) who will basically be happy with a roleplaying session as long as the content transforms effortlessly into a genre-faithful post-play story - no interest in the procedure and interaction of the actual play itself, really. Might be that this phenomenon has something to do with bitter desperation: you've been trying to get together that perfect MERP campaign for so long that you've set aside any creative goals aside from enforcing that genre feel. I was a lot like this in my youth, in fact, now that I think of it. The foremost concern in many of our games was about "playing right", which meant playing to the genre and not fucking it up with teenager miscommunications and differing cultural experiences. Call of Cthulhu, for instance - that was basically just a couple of us Lovecraft fans trying to bash the rest of the group into playing the way Lovecraft would've wanted.<br/><br/>I'm totally open to the idea that when taken to the extremes this sort of genre-fidelity is just a sign of inability in forming a functional SIS, and therefore it lacks a coherent creative agenda to begin with. I'm pretty sure that less extreme forms of this sort of thing are genuine simulationism - I can see almost all the steps in my own infrequent sim gaming of various sorts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270954/#Comment_270954" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T11:11:02+00:00" title="May 13, 2010 11:11AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thread has taken a turn towards the interesting, but away from the original post.

But, against my own will, I am still contributing to this one!<br/><br/>Here's an example from another game discussion board that I think is relevant, on the issues that come up with superhero gaming:\n<blockquote>James ran a game of "Primtime Avengers" (Avengers using the Primetime Adventure rules). I played Captain America (with the Issue: "Can Cap get over the War?"). The game was a lot of fun and went well (I think), but I felt there was a potential issue that might (or might not) have become a bigger deal had we played longer. Essentially, Primetime Adventures requires that your characters deals with his/her Issue in some way and that the process of doing so changes him/her. So, by playing Captain America in PTA, I couldn't just "be true" to the character as he exists in all those comic books: I had to author my own take on the character. Now, that was cool with me, but it does mean that the group needs to let go of its idea of "what Captain America should be" and allow this question to be answered in play. (The same thing can happen with original characters, too: in a game like PTA the question "what should super-heroes be?" is one that might only be able to be answered through play.) <br/><br/>What makes this different from other genres (IMO) is that the desire to play super-hero games correlates pretty strongly with having an intense (and probably lengthy) attachment to super-hero comics, which raise the stakes around "doing it right".</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270981/#Comment_270981" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T12:42:11+00:00" title="May 13, 2010 12:42PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><br/>Also: why would you ever pick an Issue that everyone else at the table is pretty "meh" about?

That is, even if we can describe an occasion of roleplaying as simulating/emulating some type of static fiction, that does not determine anything about the Creative Agenda of the effort. The fact that the game simulates (intentionally using the confusing word here, wait for the punchline) television just describes an useful systematic framework the players use to shape and communicate the fiction. What makes a game simulationistic or narrativistic or in general something in CA terms is the underlying purpose in the creation of that fiction.<br/><br/>What makes Primetime Adventures powerfully narrativism-facilitating is that its procedures are reliable in seeking out interesting angles on the character Issues and allowing players to address them via character choices. I'm saying that creative commitment to the Issues is necessary for narrativism because that's the narrativistic pay-off in its naked form: thematic choices in a story are only thematic when you care about them, and you'll only care about them in PTA if you have what I call "creative commitment" to the Issues that underlie the story and the choices. By "creative commitment" or "creative buy-in" I mean that you're actually interested in the Issue, considerate of the difficulty a protagonist might have in handling it and eager to see it established in a fictional framework, developed and ultimately resolved based on that development.<br/><br/>In comparison, that whole head-space is not really present in simulationism: I could see players choosing Issues in a simulationistic game as well, but those choices wouldn't be based on personal interest and appreciation of the Issue's philosophical appeal - rather, you'd choose Issues that are appropriate to the character's role in the story framework you're developing. For example, you'd pick "Authority" as your cop character's Issue because you know that somebody is supposed to be a loose cannon in the cop show you're making. You don't have a personal commitment to figuring out this authority thing, you just know that somebody needs to struggle with authority in a real cop show, so you put in the requisite amount of struggling and use that as a springboard for appreciating the forms and style of a cop show. You might well even enjoy roleplaying the struggle - in fact, it is very common for simulationism that you do enjoy depicting a struggle with authority, alcoholism or whatever problems characters happen to have. However, that enjoyment comes from getting to act out and interpret - celebrate - the process of unfolding a piece of fiction in accord with your aesthetic goals, not from being personally invested in and sympathetic of the difficult choices the character faces.<br/><br/>And yes, "simulationism" is a potentially misleading word, just like "narrativism" and "gamism". The great majority of people using these words think that "gamism" means crunch-heavy, "simulationism" means realist and "narrativism" means story-pertaining. That's just tough shit, not much for me to do about it. Probably that sort of terminological arbitrariness is just not a big deal for me because this is a foreign language to me to begin with; every word in English is just as arbitrary for me insofar as emotional connection goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271012/#Comment_271012" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T14:08:23+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  2:08PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2010 2:09PM by John_Harper.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Fred: Is there some reason why you're not just playing PTA?

The whole participation factor might fit with the gamist desire to encourage people to step up.  Pushing apparently weaker characters to come through in the clutch seems like a suitable trope.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis looks like it divides the attention of a narrativist GM.

I'm going to guess people, who have played the game, will tell me I'm wrong about this.  The question from there is <br/>\nDid I miss interpret the summary or the CA? or<br/>\nIs the summary off? or<br/>\nDo the other aspects of game play cater to narrativism enough to make up for these?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first and third cases I feel like understanding why I'm making these oversites is something that I couldn't do if my primary concern was play.  I can't correct my thinking if I don't know it's wrong.

Tone is fairly obvious, but conventions needs to include both what will and won't be addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\n"The question is about how  their personal matters will  interfere, and what they may need to give up in order to succeed."<br/>\n(This looks really narrativist confirming.  All sorts of great themes here man v himself and importance of the group v the individual.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes a simulationist need to focus on the agony of the choice to fit in with expectations?  No other crannies to explore really stick out at me.<br/>\n<br/>\nA possible gamist slant is the enabler.

Is character sim a distinction made from genre sim?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis looks like it work well narrativism, but it doesn't look verry clear on how much you know about another character.  Uncertainity about their personal interests and the like.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe gamist perspective could be interesting here.  That odd sort of mix between high achieving and backstabbing seems like it would set up numerous sorts of things at this initial stage to be used later.)<br/>\n<br/>\np 12<br/>\nStory arc: the main purpose of the weekly problem is to bring a given character's issue into the lime light.<br/>\n<br/>\nA character's issue will affect all teh choices you make in creating a protagonist.

In what respect is it "glossing over and accepting" a character issue to deliver consequences like being pulled in front of the Sarge or getting suspended or kicked off the case for being too personally involved, or being stuck with a new rookie partner, or whatever, but "exploring" that issue to deliver a consequence like getting kicked off the force?

The player in a game like this won't expect his character to actually get the boot from the police force - after all, Dirty Harry gets complaints, but he doesn't get fired, so why should I? In contrast, it would be typical of a narrativist mind-set to get inside the head of the cop character by really making career disaster a real possibility; the reason for having the scene in the first place, engaging game mechanics, being invested in it would be that the character's career is really at stake here, and we're really getting inside the character's skin by finding out whether the player chooses to try to make reparations, or whether the character's sense of justice really makes him little more than a vigilante with a badge.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: a strongly narrativist game would include the scene where your cop is threatened by losing his job as a set-up for a situation where the character has to choose between his job and his sense of justice or whatever. A strongly simulationist game would include the scene because it is an expected part of the development of events in this type of story. Presumably any CA might also skip the scene altogether on the premise that you don't generally play scenes without any point at all. The CA can tell us why a scene exists as part of the transcript of play.<br/><br/>I should note that I'm not describing all narrativism and all simulationism here. There certainly are forms of both sim and nar where the nature of a daredevil-cop-gets-a-reprimand scene would be the reverse of the above. For instance, if the game was My Life with Master or similar, it'd be clear that losing the job would be outside the bounds of the story space - the GM would just figure out some nasty and immoral punishment for the character, who certainly wouldn't get the option to quit; thus the very nature of the scene transforms from conflict background to arbitrarily evil consequences for prior failure. Similarly a naturalist-realist simulationistic game would likely let the character lose his job and then perhaps switch to a new character, depending on the campaign's direction. It all depends on the methodology actually, practically utilized in a given game to get a handle on the Creative Agenda.<br/><br/>The potentially confusing part here is that it's pretty arbitrary to decide that a narrativist or simulationist game "has to be" more or less dramatic (in the Trifold sense) than the other. It's just that in this particular discussion context we're talking about dramatic games, and ritual processes are a typical technical part of dramatic genre-sim: we play through the motions typical of the genre because we enjoy playing through them, and we're relying on those motions to reliably keep the game on the rails. In this type of game a player would be quite fair in getting annoyed if the GM declared that his daredevil cop buddy character actually gets fired and sued and removed from the campaign for doing something typical of the genre, such as being a bit too liberal with the interrogation technique. The whole point of living the dream in genre-sim is to be able to trust that as long as Spock speaks the Spock lines and Kirk speaks the Kirk lines everything will come to be well in the end. Messing with that by bringing in out-of-genre consequences is a breach of trust.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271105/#Comment_271105" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T08:58:13+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  8:58AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Side note:<br/>Subverting the source material is/can be still a celebration of source material, however, Eero.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271106/#Comment_271106" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T09:05:00+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  9:05AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2010 9:12AM by Vernon R.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's the same sort of continuity and consequence you see in something like the Lethal Weapon movies where Riggs is always getting reamed out by the Sarge for going over the line but he never gets kicked off the force. Although those movies do end up exploring the renegade aspect of his character more, for sim play think of stealing just that aspect of the movie and ignoring the rest.  You still have the character with the issue but it doesnt push play forward, it's there but it's not important.  Usually the focus of this type of game will revolve more around the plotline and discovering what the villains are up to and going through the process of catching them.  It doesnt really question whether the character will break the rules to do so or any other issues that characters may have.<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.

That can also make this discussion a bit tricky.<br/><br/>I mean, I may be misremembering the chronology involved, but I do seem to recall PTA being contemporary with some of Mike Holmes old posts about making games designed to be about what they're about, rather than going with a more trad style physics engine, then baning it about or tacking stuff on to that coore to try to get a game to be about what it's about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271112/#Comment_271112" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T09:51:37+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  9:51AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2010 10:13AM by JDCorley.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>What Vernon's getting at is that your average genre-faithful simulationistic set-up will include things like getting chewed by the Sarge because that sort of thing happens in this type of story, and not because of the actual consequences the character "really" risks. The player in a game like this won't expect his character to actually get the boot from the police force - after all, Dirty Harry gets complaints, but he doesn't get fired, so why should I?</blockquote>\nFirst of all, it's quite true to the hardboiled cop genre that the guy will in fact be kicked off the force at some point - it's pretty rare that a specific outcome of a specific situation is mandated by genre faithfulness.  Even happy endings can be put off in comic books until the end of the next arc, etc.  But this isn't really your point.  <br/><br/>For one thing, PTA actually doesn't permit him to be kicked off the force unless it's his spotlight episode, the pilot, or the season finale, OR if being a police officer is such a minor part of the character that it isn't part of his traits.  Those are the only times in PTA when you can change your traits. So I submit that PTA cleaves to what-you-call the simulationist aspect of the question much more closely than you think.  I think those situations are exactly when there is a real danger that a TV cop character will be kicked off the force (or killed, or actually marry Tess Trueheart, or whatever).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>In a nutshell: a strongly narrativist game would include the scene where your cop is threatened by losing his job as a set-up for a situation where the character has to choose between his job and his sense of justice or whatever. A strongly simulationist game would include the scene because it is an expected part of the development of events in this type of story.</blockquote>\nBut again - these are the exact same things.  We don't pick the "type of story" out of a hat, we pick it because we're interested in what the characters will choose to do in the sorts of situations and constraints imposed by the story.  So I don't see any difference between these two things at all. It's not that they sometimes overlap, it's that they are 100 percent of the time exactly the same thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271115/#Comment_271115" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T10:13:43+00:00" title="May 14, 2010 10:13AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Creative Agenda does not give you a recipe for different types of play content. It only tells you what goals introducing the different types of content might have. It is quite correct in a certain sense that the things done in sim or nar or gam type game are the "same thing": in all of those games you could and would presumably toy with the idea of a cop losing his job due to rules-breaking, and in all of those you would probably protect the robustness of the fiction by making this event flow logically from what came before. The reasons for why you bother with this content, however, are different in different GNS modes. Those differences might not be important for you if your play isn't bedeviled by CA-hopping or outright CA-incongruence (or if you're not a game designer), but that doesn't make them non-existent. My sense from our interaction is that you, Jason, probably mostly play in a narrativist mode, so maybe you just have trouble believing that somebody could actually play that daredevil-cop thing without actually being interested in having the character face a genuine moral conundrum over what amounts to a character quirk in a certain sort of cop buddy movie. Perhaps this is why what we're describing as the difference sounds like the same thing to you? Alternatively I could also believe that I'm not being so clear as I imagine myself to be - really, I should be working now instead of wranging GNS on a web forum, so my writing might not be very well considered.<br/><br/>Anyway, this sort of thing would go better in a new thread.

Pace and participation look off cause I'm thinking that narrativism demands these scale to metaplot importance.</blockquote>\nI'm not entirely sure what the "This" is, in the above, but I've found PTA caters to the narrativist GM.<br/><br/>Which, I suppose, is something itself I should take a bit about.  For all the hippie hype that narrativism gets, the division of labour between the GM and the other players is often pretty traditional in the games that support it.  If narrativism is about the players getting to engage the Premise in play, then usually the GM is not also in there engaging Premise himself.  I'm not sure if there's any confusion on that point, but hopefully it's clearer now.<br/><br/>When it comes to Pace and Participation and such... PTA especially rewards a close attention to the separation between Player and Character.  Every player gets equal turns to request Scenes, right?  That looks pretty egalitarian in terms of participation, especially since there's no reference to Screen Presence.  But here's the thing:  it's very common for a player to request a scene that his own character isn't in.  And it's up to the Director in any case to decide who is in the scene and who isn't.<br/><br/>One of the other main participation mechanisms is Fan Mail, and the players can award that at any time.<br/><br/>A lot of the Pacing comes out of the director's Budget mechanic.  But it's all pretty pure metaplot.<br/><br/><i>it doesn't look verry clear on how much you know about another character</i> -- again, one needs to keep Player and Character in mind.  How much does every Player know about every Character?  Pretty much everything.  How much do the characters know about each other?  It's going to depend on what happens in every episode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271122/#Comment_271122" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T10:30:57+00:00" title="May 14, 2010 10:30AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>My sense from our interaction is that you, Jason, probably mostly play in a narrativist mode, so maybe you just have trouble believing that somebody could actually play that daredevil-cop thing without actually being interested in having the character face a genuine moral conundrum over what amounts to a character quirk in a certain sort of cop buddy movie.</blockquote>\n(Well, I don't believe in GNS, so I don't really identify with any of the modes, I think it's all garbage.)  <br/><br/>But again, you are drawing a distinction between two things that are exactly the same.  There is no "genuine" moral conundrum in any play. That's why it's play! Nobody is really going to be shot and killed when a Dogs in the Vineyard PC guns someone down.  It's a fantasy, it's imagination, it's what-if.  We figure out what happens and are interested to see what happens next.  <br/><br/>I think what you imagine is that the person who is primarily interested in replicating buddy-cop drama (or comedy) isn't interested in his character's decision as to (for example) cover up his partner's mistake to protect him from Internal Affairs versus ratting him out, because, hey, that happens in buddy-cop dramas all the time.  But I think that turns things on its head.  The person who is primarily interested in buddy-cop drama story gaming is <i>highly</i> interested in things that happen in buddy-cop dramas all the time.  They're highly engaged in those moments.  They have to be, by virtue of their interest. If they aren't, if they really don't care what their character does in those moments, or what will happen to them as a result of their decision, they really aren't as interested in the material as we thought they were.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271133/#Comment_271133" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T11:19:41+00:00" title="May 14, 2010 11:19AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, this sim-critique needs to be taken elsewhere, Jason.

That's why the theory forums are closed on the Forge and all theory talk has to happen in the Actual Play forum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271443/#Comment_271443" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T14:32:07+00:00" title="May 15, 2010  2:32PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            According to Ron Edwards, the best way to learn more about the Bog Model (and the three currently recognized Creative Agendas) is to post some Actual Play experiences on the Forge. If you're interested in learning more about that, it's a good way to go: and Ron will show up and answer many of your questions.<br/><br/>Your Actual Play doesn't have to be current, right? If you've ever played a roleplaying game, you can use that experience to post in Actual Play at the Forge.<br/><br/>(I'm not saying that to shut down your questions here, though! Just throwing this out in case you didn't know it was an option--it's probably the fastest to understand some of this stuff: if you want to know about Ron's theory/model, why not follow his own recommendations on how best to learn about it?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/0bs01337" title="0bs01337"><img alt="0bs01337" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/0bs01337">0bs01337</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271457/#Comment_271457" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T16:48:10+00:00" title="May 15, 2010  4:48PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RE: APs<br/>\nI haven't got any reccorded (written or audio'd) so I'm pretty hesistant.  I have mainly focused on the articles though rather than then AP analysis, so I probably am trying to run before I walk.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRE: GNS misuse<br/>\nI think I'm seeing things better from your perspectives.  Basically I look like a guy who's got a hammer and now thinks everything is a nail, right?  I know I'm looking at a screw.  But as far as I've seen no one has a screwdriver and most people reccomending that I glue things.  My plan is pound in some screws with this hammer, look at the resulting split wood and try and figure out the purpose of the screw's thread and craft a screwdriver out of my hammer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is, in the long term, design related.  People don't seem to respond to mechanics the way I think they will.  The old stuff, from design contests and a self-published bit, I'm pretty distant from and aren't certain that I could explain what I was going for.  I'm not really passionate about anything floating around my head atm, so I'm pretty hesitant to toss anything out there and uncertain I could really elaborate on anything if I did.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis project, in light of my lacking a group and inspiration, seemed like a solid, methodical way of adressing these problems.  It had the added benefits of doin so without the anxieties of getting to know a new group or dealing with a lack of personal transportation.  Plus I'm aware that the breadth of games that I've played is pretty lacking, but there's the sense that play and obeservation has brought me here, with all my misconceptions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this isn't too far offer topic.  I'm addressing what I can in whispers, but I felt that some additional explaination of why might help, even though I don't plan to post further updates to this project here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271473/#Comment_271473" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T18:53:13+00:00" title="May 15, 2010  6:53PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2010 6:54PM by noclue.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fred, the thing is, so much of your speculation would be cleared up with a few sessions of play.

If you're curious about these, whisper and I'll set up a mailing list or tumblr or something.)<br/>\n2.  Read an AP while bitching at friends to run/ play in PtA <br/>\n3.  Play or run PtA (If anyone is willing to run through a chat let me know.)<br/>\n4.  write up comparison between how I thought people would use a given mechanic, how others used a mechanic and how my group did.  Hopefully moving my imagined interactions more towards reality.
