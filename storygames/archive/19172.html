So, we ended up with a compromise system to allow stat adjustment:<br/>1. Every point you lowered STR gave you a point to INT, or vice versa.<br/>2. Every 2 points you lowered ADA gave you a point to either INT, LUC or LEA.<br/>3. Every 3 points you lowered LEA, MAG or ROB gave you a point to either STR, INT or DEX.<br/>4. Every point you lowered DEX gave you 1 point to STR or INT, or every 2 points you lowered DEX gave you 3 points to ADA, MAG, or ROB.<br/><br/>Looking back on it now, I can't for the life of me remember the math, but it was the result of several evenings earnest discussion and passionate debate. We also debated whether or not "choose a race" meant you had your pick; the JM thought that since there was a table you had to roll on that. Our JM also gave Amazons an armor skill: if they wore no armor, you had -10% to hit them, and if they wore no clothing at all, -20%. Those were the days -- we would spend an entire evening just generating characters (sometimes two or three at a time), since it was such a mini-adventure to get something "just right."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VengerSatanis" title="VengerSatanis"><img alt="VengerSatanis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VengerSatanis">VengerSatanis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427877/#Comment_427877" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-02T08:47:30+00:00" title="February  2, 2014  8:47AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2014 8:48AM by VengerSatanis.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, there's definitely a push/pull thing going on between strength and intelligence.

EC is "just fine the way it is".  It's both simple and complex, straightforward and unnecessarily convoluted.  Possibly nothing... possibly everything!<br/><br/>For those curious, I created a brand new thread documenting my experience with EC in the Actual Play board.
