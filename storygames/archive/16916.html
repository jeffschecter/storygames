I really like the Silhouette system, and the overall "grittiness" of Heavy Gear, but find that the tactical rules aren't designed for a real story campaign; wargaming treats all units as potentially expendable, whereas in a character-driven RPG, it's assumed that the PCs will *usually* be able to survive encounters. <br/><br/>I'm wondering if anyone else has come across this problem in their Heavy Gear/DP9/Silhouette campaigns and what they've done about it. I've been thinking about some basic mods and house rules that would make the tactical system less deadly, but any play-tested advice would be greatly appreciated. <br/><br/>Thanks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385405/#Comment_385405" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-18T21:19:23+00:00" title="July 18, 2012  9:19PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing you could try is making it so that whenever a character would die, instead they just become "scarred" and you can apply either a small permanent or large temporary penalty (or both). You could even spin this into more story options if you were willing to get a bit more abstract with your "scars" (like, the character is taken out and his scar is that the battle causes collateral damage killing someone he loves, or whatever).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385410/#Comment_385410" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-18T23:35:03+00:00" title="July 18, 2012 11:35PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who let this guy in here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385411/#Comment_385411" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-19T01:56:15+00:00" title="July 19, 2012  1:56AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2012 1:56AM by Captain_Thark.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are there any kind of 'luck points' or similar that allow for reduction of damage or rerolls?

It can't be immediately lowered, so it's not easily spammable, and can lead to some tragic deaths as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke" title="Luke"><img alt="Luke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke">Luke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385440/#Comment_385440" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-19T15:27:41+00:00" title="July 19, 2012  3:27PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback, everyone.

The Gear is rendered useless but the character while wounded lives, typically we used a pseudo attack to see how badly they were wounded from whatever penetrated the armor or exploding controls (I think we used a single die attack at half the weapon multiplier, treated as personnel scale, without a defensive roll - but it may have been something different).  Then they can crawl out of their gear and need to be recovered or get captured, or trapped within the wreckage waiting for the winners to come cut them free.   That turned any crew kill result into a mini story driven tactical objective where they needed to evac the wounded pilot or couldn't retreat without leaving a man behind to be captured.  That produced serious enough injuries that it wasn't treated as if there was no threat but also gave us a consistent set of characters.<br/><br/>An alternate approach would be to make them pay a karma(?) point to reduce a crew kill result to a heavy injury or two to reduce it to a light injury.  That gives a moderately painful cost to getting your Gear blown apart with you in it since those are bought with xp and lets the wise who retreat advance a little faster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385608/#Comment_385608" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-22T20:45:59+00:00" title="July 22, 2012  8:45PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I loved this game years ago when I played it.

There is always some cute farm girl that finds your broken body and nurses you back to health, creating drama and complications in the process.
