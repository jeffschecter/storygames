That took me aback a bit, because "Best Practices" is a "WORK WORD", so I had a little bit of aversion to coupling Work and Hobby. But the more I thought about it, the more I like it.<br/><br/>Also, Paul gave himself away as someone who works with computers (I'd wager, anyway).<br/><br/>So I work with enterprise-level computer storage equipment at my day job. Our official stance is, "Do whatever the hell you want with it. But please check out the Best Practices guides".<br/><br/>So if some client buys some $100K computer system and "blows it up" (in my world, this usually means "hundreds of misaligned VMWare luns, impacting write performance"), then that's up to them. But we have guides that show them what they should be doing to get "the most out of their system".<br/><br/>Applied to RPGs, this idea is very applicable. A GM might "blow it up" by ignoring or forgetting some rule about how fanmail works or how you should get into play, and the session... while not Bad, it might have been Better.<br/><br/>As JD is fond of saying (though with more vigor), "The designer is dead when the product is in your hands": The game has rules. Many GMs and players will forget, ignore, or willingly change some of the rules (and others will follow them to the letter). However, for each game it might be said that there are "Best Practices", discovered in the field through play, either by the author of the game (and codified in the book as Rules or Play Advice), or through players who describe their sessions online. Compiling these Best Practices (even if it's a collection of "subjective player experiences") might be really helpful to bring a game that might be "OK" to a higher level of fun.<br/><br/>Some "Best Practices" are more or less universal: "Listen to the players", "Pay attention to pacing", blah blah blah.<br/><br/>Also, sometimes Best Practice Guides will have conflicting (or "expanded") advice that will give you some advice or suggestions for running an environment (storage hardware, routers, Gaming Table) with a particular focus: Here I would bring it back to RPGs by citing JD Corley's advice of the GM running the Producer role as if it was a real, true cigar-chompin' pinstripe suit producer with incredibly aggressive, bad and conflicting ideas in order to jog the players forward. This will produce a very unique experience that you wouldn't see if you didn't adopt that advice, but that advice would steer the game experience down a particular path: Best Practices for making Game X more Realistic; Best Practices for making Game X more Dramatic; Best Practices for Streamlining Combat in Game X.<br/><br/>Anyway, this was something that was on the mind recently: Where the designer ends and the "Purchase Now!" weblink begins is a wall, and maybe players or fans of a game cobbling their own play methods together into "best practice guides" (basically "Player Guides", just written in the field by fans/players through play experience; and not by the game designer) can help improve play experiences without having to redesign the game from scratch.<br/><br/>Just a thought.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260946/#Comment_260946" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T10:01:57+00:00" title="March  9, 2010 10:01AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm used to Best Practices referring to classrooms and academics, but I can see the application here.

Oh well, let's see what people think."<br/><br/>"I like ice cream!"<br/><br/>But now I'm kinda thinking of making some Best Practice guides or one-sheets for various games based on how I've successfully run them...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261024/#Comment_261024" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T14:17:53+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  2:17PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This, especially Guy's specific examples with Monopoly, resonate with the idea I was trying to convey with my talk of switches and dials over in David Berg's thread <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=258855" rel="nofollow">here</a>, especially in my last paragraph of the second post.

But if it STOPS at forum users--at that "wall" you mention--it's a broken methodology. Close the documentation loop.<br/><br/>(To use an IT metaphor, that's like letting stuff accumulate in an online knowledgebase, but never folding those web articles into the new manual releases. Disclaimer: I am a Tech Writer IV for a Fortune 500 IT corporation.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>I want the designer to tell me their best practices.</blockquote>\nSometimes the designer will fail at this, horribly. My best example is Weapons of the Gods. All this...<i>BOOK</i>... and no idea how to use it, in what order, what is important, etc.Which is why a designer needs to man-up and take fan-created BP documentation to heart, and incorporate it--even if it's a chapter tacked on at the end of a reprinting. I concur that an author can rarely capture every best practice, just as a tech writer can rarely capture every use case in manuals and thereby must rely on KBs to "store" supplemental info until a refresh.<br/><br/>[Aside: I love the "tyranny of the audience" vibe in this thread. FUCK a damned designer--what the hell do THEY know about their game, the effect they seek it to evoke, the tone and flavor of their world!?!  I can't wait to see a "Best Practices for IAWA" to suggest stakes setting. My point being, I think: fewer players truly grok a game better than its designer; that player base is the only one qualified to write BPs, aside from the designer.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261195/#Comment_261195" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T09:53:46+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  9:53AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2010 9:55AM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dialogue, baby. Ebony and ivory, you players and you designers can live in perfect harmony.<br/><br/>So, here's something I have to deal with in editing. I'll read something and get a completely different impression than the author did, *but I won't realize that* because the impression is subtle. So, I'll edit thinking I read that part as intended. I'll get the next round back with "uh, I didn't mean that..." I see the same thing here, where players might make a BP around something they misunderstand, and maybe it's actually not a BP because the author didn't get the point across (like, stake setting in IAWA). But, what can come from the dialogue is a third thing, a bit of clarity from the designer with advice from players.<br/><br/>Don't count the designer out, man. They might, you know, still have some fuckin' passion to pitch in and help.
