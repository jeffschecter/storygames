It was a total hoot. I finally got to play my peasant swordsman concept that I've been wanting to play since, like, elementary school. My character ended up being a lot dumber and more comical than I had ever intended, but it's good fun.<br/><br/>Invoking character traits for Artha is great. It's something that's happened very little in other games I've run but I do it every chance I get. My character has "Cry Wolf" from being a Shepherd and "Rude" as one of his cultural traits. The results is my character being a total alarmist all the time, and being incredibly socially insensitive in ways that just generate all sorts of nonsense. He complimented some dwarves on their fine craftsmanship in spite of having "knobby, sausage-like fingers" and he's currently working on a conspiracy theory that the dwarves are planning to invade and telling everyone.<br/><br/>The feedback loop of Burning Wheel is interesting and drives some cool action too. I'm not sure if we're playing 100% by the rules, but the way we've been doing it Artha is an instant reward rather than an end-of-session reward, so if you resolve a Belief you get a Persona point right there. So, I had a belief about getting a dwarven sword. I had an opportunity to steal one or maybe barter for it somewhere down the road when my brokeass swordsman got some coin, and even though I never really thought of my character as the stealing type I was like, "I can get a Persona point RIGHT NOW." So I did. It caused some shenanigans, but that's the point, right?<br/><br/>Additionally, the whole test-advance thing pushed me in an interesting direction when I got some tests for sleight of hand. I never thought of my character as the stealing type but it's like, "Hey... I already have these tests and only a few more will open up the skill..." so now I'm looking for opportunities to steal more stuff.<br/><br/>Anyways, the short version of the session is that we lost a big archery and swordsmanship competition, stole a dwarf sword, and then killed an orc that had become a local bogeyman nicknamed "the Night Creeper" that stole sheep and children and ate them. Woowoo.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181318/#Comment_181318" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-03T08:56:49+00:00" title="December  3, 2008  8:56AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think instant Artha is a pretty common house rule... and if you can do it without breaking up play too much, I don't think it harms the system in any way.<br/><br/>In fact, I'd just let people self-award (or award each other, kind of like Fan Mail),, pretty much all the time--it's usually obvious when you ping a Belief or ignore an Instinct or complete a Belief or self-sacrifice for others.

I've played both ways and I much prefer doing it at the end of the session.<br/><br/>It allows us to take stock of the session and helps everyone better understand the characters' motivations. "Oh, you did that because of that trait? That makes sense!"<br/><br/>It helps us identify characters whose beliefs aren't quite firing, and either make suggestions for ways to rewrite beliefs to better hit what they're after, or to remind us to help that player push his beliefs in the next session. It also helps the GM identify characters that need to be better highlighted in coming sessions.<br/><br/>It helps us identify traits that players aren't bringing into play, and let them know that they better bring them into play if they don't want the trait voted off at the next trait vote.<br/><br/>It helps us identify players who are eligible for the Moldbreaker award for playing against a Belief, Instinct or Trait.<br/><br/>It helps us to pick out the big moment of the session, and choose the MVP based on it.<br/><br/>It helps us recognize all the hard work done behind the scenes to make the session go, and award the Workhorse based on it.<br/><br/>It is difficult, if not impossible, to do these things in the midst of play. It's much easier to reflect on a just-finished session.<br/><br/>Also, I think handing out these awards after a session is more in keeping with Burning Wheel's slow burn. You get rewarded for your actions, but only after the fact. You may have to pay a price in today's session to have resources for next week's session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181325/#Comment_181325" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-03T09:49:56+00:00" title="December  3, 2008  9:49AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have always done the insta-artha with my group, but that is a lot of good food for thought Thor.

I put all his General Skill Points into Sword thinking he's been teaching himself to fight with a sword since he was real young. He's totally idealistic and wants to be the greatest swordsman in the land.<br/><br/>So his Beliefs were originally:<br/><br/>I will prove myself to be the greatest swordsman in the land by winning the Dragon Festival Open Tourney at the capital.<br/>A hero needs a legendary weapon, so I will get a dwarven forged sword from the Stonehaven Caravan at the capital.<br/>Anetta is my one true love, and I will win her from my brother Renn who does not deserve her.<br/><br/>The first one resolved when I took second in the tournament to some noble chump.<br/>The second one resolved when I stole the sword. I had meant for this to possibly be something where the dwarves need help with something and I help them etc. In the end, stealing it was easier.<br/>They became:<br/><br/>Lord Featherwick (the chump who beat me in the tournament) is not a true hero and I am, and I shall prove it by killing the Night Creeper.<br/>The dwarves are planning an invasion, and I will convince the captain of the guard that he must prepare for this threat.<br/><br/>And then we killed the Night Creeper so now I need to rewrite that too. I don't know what I'm going to do yet but it will probably involve pursuing my rivalry with Lord Featherwick. I think I want to throw the head of the Night Creeper at his feet in the middle of royal court or something.<br/><br/>It's interesting. My original vision of the character was an idealistic young peasant hero. In play he's turning out to be rather comical, kind of stupid and delusional, but scarily competent. He barely lost the tournament and when we fought the orc he was dead before Bob's character could finish drawing his bow. As he grows even more competent and once we do trait votes and things it'll be interesting to see what happens. I spent Artha on pretty much all of my Beliefs but for the last one, so they could easily become some kind of Trait.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181369/#Comment_181369" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-03T13:21:26+00:00" title="December  3, 2008  1:21PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We break up Artha payouts into instants and end-of-sessions:<br/><br/>Instant Artha when your character trait drives a story complication (<a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6512" rel="nofollow">I have a house rule about that</a> that's working very well in our orcs game)<br/><br/>Instant Artha for moldbreaker moments that the player draws attention to.
