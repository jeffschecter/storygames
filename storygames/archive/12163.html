It contains some questions over problematic bits (since I originally wrote it at the Forge), and the mechanics aren't explained, so go buy the game! It wasn't a mountain-top gaming moment for me or anything, but it was really fun and pretty easy, and I can see how the game just gets more and more satisfying as you plumb its depths--even from round 1 to round 2.<br/><br/>All the rules questions are directed at people who've read and/or played S/lay, so take a stab at them if that's you, don't if it's not.<br/><br/>This is part 1 of 2; in this post Brendan was the Hero &amp; I was the Lover/Monster; I'll follow up in the days to come with the aftermath of our round with me as Heroine &amp; Brendan as Lover/Monster. Here it is:<br/><br/><br/>Brendan Adkins &amp; I played S/lay today--probably the fastest turnaround time from buying a game to playing it, ever, for me. First: It was good! I want more! Now:<br/><br/>The first round Brendan was the hero, and chose "lamed &amp; sick, but my iron will commands even the dead," and described himself as "Gray hair and hollow eyes, once strong, now hobbling." The setting was "The battlefield a few days afterward." His goal was "to find the ring that was taken from me".<br/><br/>I chose a Lover of 2, Wanton, Approved, Manipulative, and Knowledgeable. Hoo boy, I didn't really stick to those at all, except for Wanton. I suppose it would have helped if I had fleshed her out a bit more. I spent several minutes making both the Lover &amp; Monster, but with someone sitting across from me in silence, I felt the pressure and all I scrawled for the Lover was "camp follower-Shasa".<br/><br/>The Monster had a score of 4, and was Slow, With Deceit, Civil, and Singly. I can make an argument for Slow, and I see Civil, but he wasn't Deceitful at all, and he had an army, which wasn't Singly. I didn't scrawl much for him at the beginning, either: "general--wizard on the losing side of battle". I didn't stick to that concept, which was stupid of me. It became established in the fiction (by me, no less!) that he was actually on the winning side of the battle. In retrospect it would have been much more interesting if I stuck with my original concept and had him be a lone, bitter general, all his troops dead.<br/><br/>Anyway, to begin: I described a scorched field with scorched corpses ringed by burlap tents full of people tending the wounded and dying, with a large tower at the far end of the battlefield. Brendan surprised me by having his hero Yun-Hai enter the scene by leaving the tower, implying that he was the owner of it (!) This created a problem for me later, which I'll come back to.<br/><br/>Yun-Hai hobbled on his crutches across the battlefield, seeking the ring that was taken from him. Shasa (the Lover), a red-haired, burlap-clad tribeswoman sought to stop him from raising the corpses on the plain to do his bidding, and he promptly ringed her with them and strode off. He swatted aside a burly tribesman with necromancy (bone spikes protruding from the earth!) and strode toward a black cave at the opposite end of the battlefield. As he was about to enter a "thump" behind him surprised Yun-Hai, and he turned around to see Shasa there, a corpse arm that she apparently ripped off laying on the ground between them. She offered herself to his services, acknowledging his great power, and he asked her to help in retrieving the ring.<br/><br/>We started the Match here, with his overtures to her taken as going toward the goal, though in retrospect I suppose it was acting toward the Lover as well.<br/><br/>All of a sudden a bunch of troops marched out of the cave, with the Monster (Silman, a robed stranger) following. He had the ring, and Shasa wrenched it from him, but he paralyzed Yun-Hai with a muttering and got the ring back before slapping Shasa away. She accidentally knocked one of Yun-Hai's crutches away, though he still stood, paralyzed. Silman began choking him and said, "The tower is ours. Give up." Then he dismissed the paralyzation spell, and Yun-Hai fell over, but not before grabbing the ring off of Silman's necklace and throwing it to Shasa, yelling for her to get away. Silman order his guard to drag Yun-Hai into the cave, and they went down, down, down. Yun-Hai was deposited in a torch-lit cavern with a corpse in front of him. Silman was at the opposite end, with a corpse in front of him, too. He said something like, "I will defeat you and prove who is worthy of the tower," and began muttering incantations and taking out vials and things from his robes. The corpse in front of him began to twitch.<br/><br/>Yun-Hai ignored his corpse and crawled over to Silman, who was in a trance. I don't remember exactly what happened here, but some rustling about was had and then Silman's eyes flew open, he pulled out a dagger, and stabbed Yun-Hai in the chest. Yun-Hai stole another ring off Silman and somehow got away, fleeing to the battlefield. At this point the Match was over and Brendan (Yun-Hai) won, with only two Good Dice. He chose to save the Lover (even though she wasn't clearly at risk. I chose to interpret his choice as an affirmative that she was at risk, but in retrospect I probably should have said "she wasn't at risk when we last saw her, so you can choose something else," right?).<br/><br/>So he didn't recover from the monster's harm, and ended up with a paralyzed arm from the poisoned stab. Silman lived, and dug himself deeper underground as his troops were massacred on the open field by a horde of undead. Yun-Hai marched to his tower, where the undead horde were standing before Shasa. She gave Yun-Hai his ring back, and he gave her Silman's ring and pledged his love for her. He then fell over, exhausted by his wounds, and as Shasa put the other ring on, the horde snapped to attention and waited for orders from their new master, Shasa. Officially Brendan chose "Stay there with the Lover", but something interesting happened next: He narrated Yun-Hai dying and being resurrected on the spot as one of Shasa's loyal horde.<br/><br/>It took me a minute to realize what Brendan did, and that's when I asked, "So he chose to stay with the lover?" and Brendan confirmed. I didn't press the issue then, but now in post I'm looking at it and thinking, "Yun-Hai shouldn't have died, right?" because he achieved the Goal. It didn't matter for the game, because it was a one-shot at a gaming meetup, and the story was over anyway because he chose to stay with the Lover, but ideally Yun-Hai wouldn't have died. Am I pressing the issue too much? Since the story's over, does it matter, fictionally, in what way he "stayed with the Lover"? I suppose it does to me, and that's why I keep bringing it up.<br/><br/>Also, I said I would talk about it later, and here it is: since Yun-Hai was a part of the setting (the tower was his) can "taking the Lover" and "staying with the Lover" actually be meaningful choices? Now that I'm writing this I see that it probably can: the distinction could have been between taking Shasa to his tower and then on further adventures, or abandoning the tower and staying with her &amp; her tribespeople. I didn't think of that in play, but my brain did a "wait, isn't this made for adventurers to come from the outside into this setting?" Brendan's surprise of having Yun-Hai enter the setting from the tower itself was cool &amp; thus distracting, so I didn't call it out. Should I have?<br/><br/>Another question whose answer will be fruitful for me: When you're "I", how long does it usually take to make the Lover &amp; Monster? How much description do you write down or think up? How much is needed?<br/><br/>I suspect that part of my problem was letting nerves get the better of me during play--I did rush (the whole thing above took 40 minutes from the moment we opened the book and I started explaining), against textual instructions. This game sure as hell is "face to face," and it takes a bit to get comfortable with another person across the table, waiting for your input. The next round was much better and more satisfying. I count this one as a warm-up. Though, to be fair, Brendan had no spoken qualms with it. I do tend to judge myself pretty harshly and thus hamper my fun when I'm in the facilitator/GM role of something (I've gotta stop doing that, it's really lame), which wasn't a problem when I was the hero. A post of which is forthcoming.<br/><br/>And thanks for playing with me, Brendan! All the problems I had during this first round were really my own, and don't have any bearing on your contribution to the game and the fiction.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272673/#Comment_272673" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T16:07:29+00:00" title="May 23, 2010  4:07PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet, I was hoping you'd do an AP.  Thanks for running!  I didn't have any problems at all with the actual game; I think the pacing was a bit jerky, but that was just as much my fault.  Like you said, the first game was basically a warmup.<br/><br/>A couple clarifying details:  Yun-Hai crawled over his designated corpse during the duel because he was intent on just straight-up strangling Silman (and Silman stabbed him in desperation when that worked pretty well).  He managed to choke Silman into unconsciousness and then used Silman's necro-ring to rise bodily out of the pit.<br/><br/>As for the death, I wanted to imply that it was a deliberate choice <i>after</i> the Match--a consequence of the wounds he suffered, but just as much a result of putting on his own ring.  I specifically never put it on, even when given the chance, because I sort of had in mind that it would be a bad thing when he did.  I didn't realize it would bother you to have him "die," but I guess that makes sense, since I was violating one of the fictional constraints right at the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272700/#Comment_272700" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T20:56:10+00:00" title="May 23, 2010  8:56PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brendan</cite><br/>As for the death, I wanted to imply that it was a deliberate choice<i>after</i>the Match--a consequence of the wounds he suffered, but just as much a result of putting on his own ring.

You can buy the book at <a href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/64" rel="nofollow">the Un-Store</a> for $12, shipping included, though. It's totally worth it.<br/><br/>Now, for the second part:<br/><br/>I chose "My songs are beloved wherever I go, but I fear they sow doom &amp; horror in my wake." My description was "a young woman with short dark hair carrying a lute." Her name was Suki. The setting was "The last remaining holy place of the first god." Suki's Goal here was "to supplicate the first god to banish the curse on my voice." I'll talk about Brendan's choices as Monster/Lover after I recap the fiction, since that's how I experienced it and showed me something about how the prep worked for someone else.<br/><br/>I'm a little fuzzy on the beginning details, but I know that Brendan described a smallish waterfall that hit against a large bell that, because of the constant stream of water, tolled "bong...bong...bong" back and forth. Behind this waterfall was a cave-like entrance. There were indications that there used to be many more streams and falls and smaller bells, but this was the largest and the last remaining.<br/><br/>I had Suki enter by walking under the waterfall, dousing herself, and then walking into the cave soaked. Goes were on. There was an older woman inside, hair streaked with gray who was stringing beads onto a leather cord. She asked Suki what her business was here, and Suki told her of her need to sacrifice to the first god. The woman welcomed her and led her to some quarters to rest, but informed Suki that she only had one blanket, and would it be OK to share (awesome!)? Suki agreed, took the blanket, and fell into a deep sleep, where in a dream she dropped underneath the cave complex and one after the other slew a horde of man-ape things, and woke up when she reached Lelaine (the older woman). Interestingly, Brendan ended his go at the beginning of the dream and I described what was in the dream. Later, he informed me that he had originally envisioned something else for the dream, which would have played into something he had in mind later in the fiction. Still, it worked out, and I reincorporated the ape-men-things later on.<br/><br/>Suki woke up, it was dark, and she saw the light of a candle outside of her room, and followed it to Lelaine, who was hooded in her robes. She asked Suki if she would like to be taken to the altar of her god, and of course she agreed.<br/><br/>We stopped for a second and discussed whether the Match was starting, since this could be interpreted as Suki acting toward her goal. Since the text is pretty ambiguous at this stage (acting toward the Goal is more fleshed out in the Match and means specific things, but here it just says "act toward the Goal, the Lover, or both". We wanted to draw the story out a bit more since the first one went by in a blaze, so we decided to not start the Match just yet.<br/><br/>Suki followed Lelaine down some darkened, twisting passageways to a huge cavern, the ceiling and end not clearly seen with the weak candlelight. Lelaine led Suki to the center, and Suki kneeled in front of an alter, Lelaine standing by. Suki began to sing, and in the places where her voice echoed off the walls of the cavern, dark shapes appeared and dropped thudding to the ground. Suki stopped singing, stood, and took from her sack the hewn head of a man-ape-thing, then deposited it on the altar of seven uncut stones. Then Lelaine said something threatening to the effect that the god had given Suki her "gift" and that she should not ask for it to be taken away that that she should stay here with the god and Lelaine.<br/><br/>It was at this point that I realized Lelaine was also the monster! This was a very gratifying moment of play for me. The Match was officially on.<br/><br/>I think Suki first entreated Lelaine by sidling up to her, which got me the Lover die. Then Lelaine threatened further (sorry I can't remember this; it was great during play but it's lost on me now. Feel free to chime in, Brendan), and Suki began backing away, dagger drawn. We could hear the gibbering, childlike singing of the bat-things created by Suki's voice all around us. As she kept retreating, Suki sang in the bat-thing language and a B-T dropped bodily on Lelaine, obscuring her face, but not before she called out some prayer and the leathery beating of wings was heard above Suki. Lelaine shrieked as a gout of blood spurted out where her face would be. She dropped her candle, and the cavern was plunged into darkness. The bat-thing above Suki was coming down, down, but before it reached her Suki shouted out a frustrated prayer to the god, asking it to free her from her curse.<br/><br/>I believe the Match ended somewhere around here. I lost miserably, only rolling two dice during the whole Match. I was so into what was going on in the fiction and responding to Brendan's input that I wasn't really thinking about going for my Goal &amp; Lover dice. I got that one Goal die from the yelled prayer toward the end, and I believe I got the 1 Lover die available by pressing my body against Lelaine's shortly after the Match started. Funnily enough, once I (Hans) realized that Lelaine was the Monster, so did Suki. It would have been cool if I hadn't had her be so jumpy and just talked to Lelaine more, making more overtures to her as the Lover. I think this was an emergent effect of having the Lover be the Monster, but it doesn't always have to be. Now that I realize that I was having Suki use my knowledge, in the future I know I can pull back from that a bit and keep the Lover in play some more.<br/><br/>Since I didn't win the Match, and I only had 2 Good Dice, I chose to recover from the harm the monster does to me. I don't believe any real harm was done up to this point (again, correct me Brendan), but I took the text literally when it said, "Otherwise, the Monster hurts you severely". As I wanted Suki to live, it was either that choice or having her get the Goal. In the moment it was hard for me to see how that would work, but really it was that I wanted Suki to live with this curse a while longer, especially since it was pretty helpful to her (creating monsters and commanding them with her voice!). I liked the idea that she had this powerful ability that she counted as a curse and wanted to rid herself of.<br/><br/>So the god didn't respond to Suki, and she bolted from the cavern, slipping and running blindly up dark passages until she reached Lelaine's room, where a single lit candle held vigil outside the door. She ran into the room &amp; grabbed her lute, and ran outside into the dark, soaking herself again in the waterfall. The lute now had a a very very old-looking beaded leather string, akin to the one Lelaine was working on in the beginning. To me, this opened up the possibility that Lelaine had been some sort of ghost or spirit, because the string was so ancient-looking. We didn't talk about this openly though: is that what you were going for, Brendan?<br/><br/>Since we had to incorporate "the Monster lives, although you escape," and "Otherwise [the Lover] dies", and they were the same person, we ended with a cut back to the cavern where Lelaine stood, her lower jaw ripped off and bleeding. She rasped something horrible and guttural out of her throat, and the bat-things were hers to command. Lelaine was dead; only the Monster remained.<br/><br/>Now to Brendan's prep: he chose Lover (1), Wanton/Forbidden/Manipulative/Knowledgeable, and Monster (4) Slow/With Deceit/Savage/Singly. In contrast to myself in the first round, I think he played those descriptors fantastically, and to the hilt!<br/><br/>Here's where it becomes really informative: He had an idea in the beginning that the lover and the monster were the same person, but he wasn't sure. He just did it all off-the-cuff, and it worked. And his notes that I have in front of me don't have any scrawls of description, other than Lelaine's name which was created in play. Whereas I prepped, and instead of sticking to my prep, I waffled and changed my people based on the fiction. Brendan also changed the M/L based on the fiction (from my perspective), but he stuck to the descriptors. This is important because it means that it's less crucial to have a fully-fleshed Monster &amp; Lover at the beginning of play and more crucial to stay true to the descriptors you've chosen. This will help me play S/lay better, as it shows me what matters most about the prep. I don't know why this is a surprise, because the text says nary a thing about fleshing out the Monster &amp; Lover in a "write 10 words about" sense, but it says to "especially consider" the descriptors. Huh. And here I thought I had read it closely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272764/#Comment_272764" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-24T10:00:32+00:00" title="May 24, 2010 10:00AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I totally didn't realize the bat-things were an effect of the curse, or that Suki was controlling them!  I just thought they were part of the oldest god's general evil reaction to supplicants.  Having Suki create them makes for an even more interesting climax.<br/><br/>The way Lelaine threatened Suki was by digging her nails into Suki's arms and running her tongue along the sharp blade of the dagger, letting her blood drip down onto Suki's knuckles (my Go).  Then in Hans's Go, he had Suki try to pull back and level the dagger at Lelaine's body, and Lelaine respond by driving herself onto the blade to get closer!<br/><br/>Other details:   When Suki was fleeing the cavern, she followed a strumming sound that came from her own lute; the string of beads she found tied to it was old because I thought of it as something Lelaine had made in childhood, and as representing the last of her innocence and goodness.  Also, I had vague ideas in mind that the last god himself would speak to Suki in her dream, but basically I just wanted it to be something vast and frightening, and the ape-men worked just as well for that.<br/><br/>This round definitely ran better, as we agreed, but I think that was very much due to both of us warming up to the system and getting comfortable across the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272884/#Comment_272884" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-24T16:14:21+00:00" title="May 24, 2010  4:14PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brendan</cite><br/><br/>The way Lelaine threatened Suki was by digging her nails into Suki's arms and running her tongue along the sharp blade of the dagger, letting her blood drip down onto Suki's knuckles (my Go).
