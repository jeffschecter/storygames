And I <i>still</i> want to run a Final Fantasy VII game.<br/><br/>Sadly, most of my players couldn't care less about Final Fantasy VII and anime tropes in general. Maybe I should work it up as a con game instead.<br/><br/>I mean <i>come on!</i> Beast tattoos could so <i>totally</i> be Enemy Skill Materia.<br/><br/>Gah, this idea is one of many that's eating my brain.<br/><br/>(I will need to ponder how I handle Limit Breaks. Maybe that's how you damage, instead of calling it "I'll do damage" now -- but then it doesn't connect with how damaged you are.)</blockquote>\nThe vibe I got out of playing Beast Hunters at Go Play NW was one of "Dude, be awesome, do badass shit!  The crazier, the better!"  I had a moment where I was thinking about the visuals from FF7: Advent Children.  And it all clicked: Beast Hunters is so a great choice for a Final Fantasy VII game (or, at least a combat could easily be a high-energy anime combat, and FF7 is something near and dear to my heart).<br/><br/>So, for those fans of FF7, what would you see as crucial in a game to keep it feeling like an FF7 game?  Do you care about Limit Breaks?  Item &amp; MP management?  Summons?  Materia?  What totally rocked for you that you'd love to see in an RPG hack?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82097/#Comment_82097" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T16:07:27+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  4:07PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, for those fans of FF7, what would you see as crucial in a game to keep it feeling like an FF7 game?

I also want all the social relationship/romance stuff, the tragedy (Aries dies!), all the cool weapons and gear and shit, the exploration and discovery of the strange and wonderful world, the rotating cast of characters, the flashback scenes, the little dances after you defeat the bad guys and the theme music. <br/><br/>I know that's a tall order. I also know that Beast unters can do at least some of that completely unmodified.<br/><br/><br/>jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82144/#Comment_82144" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T20:04:31+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  8:04PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the trick is finding the stuff that FFVII does, but not as well as it could have because of the medium in which it was produced. Finding the stuff that FFVII could do better if it had been a story-game. Some things, like the mechanics behind Materia, calculating damages, and random encounters might be best on a console. Other stuff, like the epic story and cut scenes might be <i>more</i> awesome at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82233/#Comment_82233" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T08:57:13+00:00" title="July 19, 2007  8:57AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, as a twist on what Daniel is saying, that you should find what you want to get out of playing FFVII *with your friends* and focus on that. Because one of the main things you can't do on the console is, obviously, to play with other people and make shit up together. So by that very token, you're already exploring venues you can't do with the console game.<br/><br/>What I liked about Final Fantasy games are the kickass moves, teamwork, and awesome boss fights in cool settings. Those you can definitely do with BH. I'd put a greater focus on the characters working together, maybe make up powers that allow bonuses for teaming up and the likes.<br/><br/>I might also consider, to make it more action RPG like, to directly link Maneuvers and Strikes. Seeing that you will have the ability to heal after a short time (usually in the FF series after every few fights, what with save sphere refreshes and the likes), I'd say give people free Strikes whenever they make an Offensive Maneuver. So you're almost always doing damage, like in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LordZoma" title="LordZoma"><img alt="LordZoma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LordZoma">LordZoma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85686/#Comment_85686" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-05T17:41:45+00:00" title="August  5, 2007  5:41PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2007 5:42PM by LordZoma.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I created an AD&amp;D hack that incorporated every final fantasy game from 1 to 9, as well secret of mana, and chrono trigger. I converted every rule, item, and system, including materias, and junctions, magicite, etc, into ad&amp;d compatible rules. The campaign included more than 20 people over the course of 3 years, and we still play it on and off. Ryan - if you have any specific questions about anything go ahead and ask. I'll dig up some of the characters later so I can show you some of the limit break skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
