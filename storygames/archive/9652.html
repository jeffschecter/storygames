And due to scheduling, we've been unable to get back to the game for two weeks. I'm def jonesin' to finish it right now.<br/><br/>But I can't. So, instead, I am just going to spend my workday thinking about it, and the elements that inspired it.<br/>Maybe you want to join me!<br/><br/>The title track to this road trip was "Sixteen, Maybe Less" by Iron &amp; Wine, off Daniel Wood's (icecreamemperor's) mix CD "My Disappointment".<br/>Beautiful, crushing, melancholy <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDcJd6x7hN8&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">song</a>.<br/><br/>It has lyrics:<br/><i>Beyond the ridge to the left, you asked me what I want<br/>Between the trees and cicadas singing round the pond<br/>\u201cI spent an hour with you, should I want anything else?\u201d<br/>One grin and wink like the neon on the liquor store<br/>We were sixteen, maybe less, maybe a little more<br/>I walked home smiling, I finally had a story to tell<br/><br/>And though an autumn-time lullaby sang our new-born love to sleep<br/>My brother told me, he saw you there<br/>In the woods one Christmas Eve, waiting<br/><br/>I met my wife at a party when I drank too much<br/>My son is married and tells me we don\u2019t talk enough<br/>Call it predictable, yesterday my dream was of you<br/>Beyond the ridge to the west, the sun had left the sky<br/>Between the trees and pond you put your hand in mine<br/>Said, \u201cTime has bridled us both but I remember you, too\u201d<br/><br/>And though an autumn-time lullaby sang our new-born love to sleep<br/>I dreamt I traveled and found you there<br/>In the woods one Christmas Eve, waiting</i><br/><br/>Here's the activity:<br/>If this song were the inspiration for a road trip - if this were the credit song or the theme song to a road trip movie - what would the trip be like?<br/>What would be the initial situation?<br/>Who's on the trip?

It's like that, for me: older people driving, with the shadows of former relationships haunting them. <br/><br/><i>What would be the initial situation?</i><br/><br/>It's four days until Christmas and the guy, who's newly divorced and unemployed, decides to get away from Los Angeles. He's going to visit the girl he left twenty years ago.<br/><br/><i>Who's on the trip?</i><br/><br/>Him, his old schoolfriend who's an unemployed actor and a girl who thinks she's psychic.<br/><br/><i> Where are they going?</i><br/><br/>Up Highway 1 to San Francisco and into wine country.<br/><br/><i>What do they think they want?</i><br/><br/>To rediscover their childhood, but they're actually grown-up now, and they'll probably find that's preferable.<br/><br/><i>What's the tone?</i><br/><br/>Melancholy, but with hope.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214346/#Comment_214346" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-25T11:22:36+00:00" title="June 25, 2009 11:22AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't participate atm, but I adore Iron &amp; Wine and they have lots of great songs that would make good Ribbon Drive fodder.<br/><br/>Our Endless Numbered Days is one of my favorite albums.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214347/#Comment_214347" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-25T11:23:51+00:00" title="June 25, 2009 11:23AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, cool!<br/><br/>Hearing "Melancholy, but with hope." and thinking about the ending with "but they're actually grown-up now, and they'll probably find that's preferable"....<br/>I'm imagining a really downbeat tone that suddenly shifts near the end, to pop-y and joyous in a "well, fuck my aspirations.
