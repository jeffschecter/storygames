Apparently, no one in the Sacramento area knows what InSpectres is, so there were no sign-ups for my Venture Bros. based mod, but I did manage to convince some people at the last minute to play the UnSpeakable mod, and we had a great deal of fun. I've also lately had an itch to play Blood &amp; Steel, Jared's sword &amp; sorcery mod for octaNe, and I read his off-the-top-of-his-head mod for Grindhouse.</p>\n<p>What these experiences have taught me is that InSpectres and octaNe mods are quick, easy, and <em>fun</em>. You just need a mechanic or two to highlight features you want to focus on for a particular genre, if the genre strays significantly from the default for either game. I've heard that there have been lots of mods already. But what occurred to me recently is this: it might be useful to collect a list of quick mods, either in a forum thread or on a web page, so people can quickly mod up either game to suit their purposes. Not full genre descriptions, just the individual tweaks and what genres, moods or styles are good for. Something like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tool Dice</strong> (borrowed from a Wushu optional rule): a modified version of the Teamwork rule. Characters can help others by inventing or modifying gadgets. Instead of rolling dice and loaning one to another player, set it aside on a card or piece of scratch paper with the name of the tool or device. Any player can use the tool later to use that die result. <strong>Uses</strong>: genres with more focus on tech, such as '60s spies or '50s atomic horror.</li>\n<li><strong>Relationships</strong> (borrowed from Trollbabe): players can form relationships with NPCs and call on them to roll an extra die for a skill roll. However, the player is risking that relationship by doing so; on a roll of 3 or less, the NPC feels used or is injured, requiring a follow-up Stress Roll. Players must describe how they are using their friends or relatives before rolling; based on the description, the GM may raise the threshold from 3 to 4 or less/5 or less. Both the character and the NPC take stress penalties; if an NPC's stress penalty is more than the PC's Contact, that relationship is lost. <strong>Uses</strong>: genres with more emphasis on personal relationships and the strains put on them, like modern cop dramas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>... And so on. I can think of a couple others, but I'm wondering whether a web page or resource like this is something other people would find valuable. Anyone else want to contribute?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71208/#Comment_71208" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T18:03:10+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  6:03PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>You've got your InSpectres in my octaNe!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Theme Dice</strong>: standard octaNe plot points can be treated as InSpectres bonus dice, essentially turning them into "named plot twists". Change the names of the bonus dice (Credit Card, Gym Card, Library Card, the Bank) to match broad themes or events you want to see in the game. Example: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2685&amp;page=1#Item_3" rel="nofollow">Jared's "Grindhouse" mod</a> <strong>Uses</strong>: focusing on a particular genre.</li>\n<li><strong>Mission Dice</strong>: the octaNe equivalent of Franchise Dice; when players earn a plot points equal to the Mission Dice, the adventure is over. Best when combined with Theme Dice. The Grindhouse mod uses both. <strong>Uses</strong>: recreating an adventure/mission feel. Good for dungeon crawls, for example.</li>\n<li><strong>Stress Meters</strong>: work exactly like they do in UnSpeakable. Characters start with a Sanity or Humanity rating which is tested by Stress Rolls in very specific situations. <strong>Uses</strong>: for emulating a genre-specific form of stress, like homicidal mania for a gritty post-apocalyptic game, or dehumanization in a cyberpunk or vampire game.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You've got your octaNe in my InSpectres!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hazards</strong>: the GM can indicate that a particular goal is harder than normal by setting an octaNe hazard rating. For every Hazard point, one high die roll is cancelled. Cool points can be spent to reduce hazards temporarily. <strong>Uses</strong>: pacing.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
