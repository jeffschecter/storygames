Your examples don't even seem quite consistent to me.  For example, take your suggested Non-Actionable Setting "Dogs travel from town to town, ridding them of sin."  This is primarily a statement about character behavior -- i.e. the Dogs choose to travel, and their goal is to rid a town of sin.  If the players change their characters' motivation, they might well change this fundamental aspect of the game.  <br/><br/>Many games will leave the setting more-or-less intact, without a change that could be viewed as fundamental.  However, some games may change the setting.  Taking your example of Dogs in the Vineyard.  Let me pick two examples: <br/><br/>1) A demon gets a victory over the Dogs PCs, and suddenly they find themselves 150 years in the future, among the Faithful of a near future world - where they have to deal with the influence of virtual reality games on the Faithful and so forth.  <br/><br/>2) The PCs decide that a town really needs them, and settle to become the permanent guardians of that town rather than wandering.  <br/><br/>Are either of these fundamental changes?  <br/><br/>To take a non-hypothetical example, I ran a campaign of Lacuna recently, in which a number of the PCs ended up deciding to leave The Company and take up with a rival NGO.  That was a very major change from the original premise, and yet I thought it was also a very interesting direction for the game to take.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281813/#Comment_281813" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T21:12:03+00:00" title="July 19, 2010  9:12PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I thought "actionable setting" meant "setting that gets used in play".
