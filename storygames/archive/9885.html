If any character falls into the pit, they are instantly killed. The object of the scenario is to defeat all characters in your opponent's army.<br/><br/>Alice is the referee, and has interpreted the rules such that if any character falls into the pit, nobody gets any XP for it.<br/><br/>Beatrice and Catherine are playing the scenario. Beatrice's army includes a character who can Teleport their enemies within 10 squares. This character is a valid model published by the same company who wrote the base rules and the scenario.<br/><br/>Play begins, and Beatrice moves her army within range of Catherine's. Catherine takes some potshots at Beatrice's figures. Beatrice spends this, and each subsequent turn, Teleporting Catherine's characters into the bottomless pit, thus yielding no XP, but eventually easily winning the scenario.<br/><br/>Catherine complains loudly at the unfairness of this tactic, and how Beatrice isn't playing the game right, citing the lack of XP reward as an indicator that Beatrice is just doing it to mess with her fun. She petitions Alice to either remove the pit from the map, make it impossible to Teleport someone to the pit, or reduce the range of Teleport, or <i>something</i>. Beatrice defends herself saying she's just trying to win the scenario, and that seemed to be the easiest way to do it - the lack of XP doesn't bother her.<br/><br/>Alice is mysteriously quiet on the matter and just silently points to the rules.<br/><br/>The scenario starts up again, Catherine changes her tactic slightly, but Beatrice easily wins using the same tactic as before. More complaints ensue. Rinse, repeat.<br/><br/>Who is at fault?<br/><br/>Alice, for refraining from house ruling the scenario or the rules to ensure Catherine can use her army on equal footing?<br/>Beatrice, for exploiting the unintended (?) consequence of the Teleport rules and the bottomless pit?<br/>Catherine, for complaining at the unfairness of it all?<br/>The game itself, for failing to account for the powerful combo of Teleport and pit?<br/>The Creator of the universe who allows such sorrow to occur, yet does nothing about it?<br/><br/>Weigh in.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219648/#Comment_219648" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T13:58:39+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  1:58PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll weigh in with it depends.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did the designer of the scenario have in mind when they wrote the scenario?  Were they envisioning the pit as being a big decisive feature that players were supposed to manipulate for victory?  If so, then Beatrice figured it out, and Catherine didn't.  Beatrice wins.  One might argue that if Alice had to interpret the rules for the impact of the pit that perhaps the unnamed designer should have done a better job making it clear what the scenario was really about, especially if its a tournament.  One might not highlight the issue to the players as a way of rewarding the studious and prepared...but one should certainly highlight the issue to the refs so they know what's going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, however, the designer never even considered the impact of the pit of death and how it would interplay with powers, skewing heavily the actual value of a figure relative to its pointed value...then its a poorly designed scenario and the designer needs a kick in the butt.  If it was clear that the designer hadn't properly thought through all of the implications then Alice, as organizer, should have stepped in and made the necessary rulings.  Since this is a tournament scenario she would have to do so in conjunction with all of the other referees for that tournament.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs with so much in life, the problem begins and ends with incompatable expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nCatherine had the expectation that the tournament would be balanced based on the point value of the armies.  1000 point army is a 1000 point army.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeatrice had the expectation that the tournament created a special situation that rendered the Teleportation power vastly more useful than its mere points would suggest...and that this was by design, so she used it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe designer had the duty to make the scenario's expectations clear (especially in a tourney) to the referees, which this example does not give enough information to determine if that was done.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlice had the duty to discover what the scenario's expecations were before refing a tournament.  The example suggests ("mysteriously quiet") that Alice did not do this but is inconclusive.  What effort did Alice make to coordinate with other refs at the tournament to make sure all were interpretting the scenario's expectations the same way...an important factor in a tourney environment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219649/#Comment_219649" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T13:59:14+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  1:59PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 2:03PM by Thunder_God.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to bring up something that I came across recently in my studies.<br><br>Humans like to ascribe responsibility.

I would only assign responsibility if it's an oversight, in a way. As for this scenario, I don't think Beatrice is doing anything wrong, the goal is not to get the most XP, getting XP is a way to help one achieve the goal, of victory.<br/><br/>As for how it changes the above: By signing up for a tournament, you sign up to face things that you will not like, or are not ready for, and try to eke out a win. As I made clear in the other post, in Magic: the Gathering or Warmachine tournaments, there are things I'll play against though I'd be rather unwilling to do it outside of a tournament. When I sign up for a tournament, I sign up to meet opponents who will do everything they can (legally, and in the spirit of sportsmanship*) to win.<br/><br/>* No cheating.

I presented it much less to prove a point, and much more to actually hear how people here felt regarding the issue un-complicated either by attachment to or detachment from the game in question. To make the analogy more complete, I would by necessity have to include the motivations of the designer/publisher/Alice conglomerate (who gets paid megabucks by people involved in their organized play and value player retention over everything else), the tournament host, the other players in the tournament, the shouting and hollering by bystanders, and so on. That would make it useless as an analogy designed to get to the crux of the matter, though.<br/><br/>From what I read into from your answers, nobody seems to be holding a grudge against Beatrice. It may be that the perp that Beatrice represents (Prof. David Myers) has a long history of similar infractions against other players in the game, and this would make Beatrice a less sympathetic character, but in this limited scenario it seems pretty clear that she is largely without blame. Catherine, similarly, can only be held accountable insofar as she can leave the game at any time, but chooses not to (and the incessant whining is pretty obnoxious). Alice is just "doing her job", which presumably doesn't mean "make sure everyone has fun" but rather "ensure a smooth tournament" (much like any MMO operations team aren't accountable for making players delirious with joy, but just answer petitions and provide general assistance).<br/><br/>In conclusion, I'm leaning towards Ralph's judgment - if anyone's to be held accountable, it's the company who put out a rule set, miniatures, and scenario which - in combination - is unbalanced: trivial for some players and impossible for others. In the absence of oversight from the company, Alice might've rescued the tournament and the players' fun by making a tournament-wide ruling, but would've gone beyond the call of duty in doing so.<br/><br/>The situation is problematic due to a large number of factors, and it is hard to assign conclusive blame - most definitely conclusive blame directed towards Beatrice. Yet, from Catherine's PoV, Beatrice is clearly a "griefer", while from Beatrice's PoV Catherine is clearly a "scrub". To bring this back to CoH/CoV, the players involved should really quit name slinging and go after NCsoft (remember, the entity which is ultimately motivated by the profit involved in attraction and retention of as many players as possible, even players with dramatically incoherent play styles, and whose appointed referees are "mysteriously quiet"?) with torches and pitchforks until they make their game coherent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219761/#Comment_219761" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T06:58:29+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  6:58AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I agree with Shreyas, as usual.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219762/#Comment_219762" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T07:06:31+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  7:06AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If there's any fault here at all, it's Catherine's, for continuing to play a game that she's not having fun at.

You're also trying to use a situation where two people start the game at the same time as an analogy for a game where one person comes into an existing social structure. <br/><br/>I understand your point, but I don't think it works. You cannot eliminate the social dynamic of 1) a huge group of people who 2) created social rules before the person in question arrived.

In the context of a large multi-player game, there will definitely be a layer of player norms which play a large part in how the game is "meant to be played" from an emergent play perspective. You'll note I'm also removing all prior history in this thought experiment, with regards to earlier rulings, player relationships, status and notoriety, etc.<br/><br/>The reason I started this thread was not to show how the Myers experiment was valid and how his conclusions were sound, but how you <i>cannot</i> start name-calling and assigning blame ("griefer", "scrub", "dick" etc) without considering the underlying design principles of the game and the responsibility of the game's designers and operators. I saw an awful lot of "well, player so-and-so is obviously to blame" in the accompanying thread and it made me concerned, especially given the context of this forum.<br/><br/>Also, I think there's a big difference between a sandbox-style game (like a MUSH or a Play-by-Forum community) and a very structured and mechanically completionist game (like EVE Online, many MUDs, HeroClix, or Chess). The first style <i>relies</i> on social rules to create any type of consistent play, while the second type can (at least <i>seemingly</i>) be played exactly as presented without worrying about social norms and unspoken rules of engagement. Tabletop RPGs straddle these two types, which is what has led to the development of theories and techniques for managing social contract, etc. Where CoH/CoV falls, I think, is more nebulous and subjective. Obviously Myers seems to think it a mechanically completionist game where, as long as he's not <i>cheating</i>, his objective - which must be met, at any cost - is the fictionally supported goal of eradicating villains. His opponents seem to describe the game more as a sandbox-style game where the objective is to get mechanically more powerful by fully utilizing the reward system. And in all this, NCsoft is taking a hands-off approach, refusing to properly describe the intention behind their game's objective - presumably to cater to all possible viewpoints of their subscribers simultaneously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219784/#Comment_219784" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T08:37:00+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  8:37AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 8:38AM by Thunder_God.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, to cross-over a small point from the other thread.<br/><br/>You may create "Social rules", but they're not there as static entities. Social rules and norms are constantly re-negotiated, and that is what people alluded to in what you referenced, regarding how a community joins to attack the person who doesn't heed the rules. That's the Functionalist's view of what purpose deviation serves in society.<br/><br/>Edit: Not that I think you're wrong, just that this point is not so clear-cut. The social rules that exist? They are still being negotiated and re-negotiated, and will continue to be ad infinitum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219795/#Comment_219795" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T09:34:51+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  9:34AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mikael,<br/><br/>Myers, of course, realized that he was angering a supermajority of the other players, realized that there were vast petitions of players asking for his removal, was bombarded with so many insults he had to shut off channels, was so marginalized on the game that he was forced to act alone, and received death threats. I don't think it's a huge stretch to say that he was acting like a dick, regardless of any other factors. He entered a group with social rules, ignored the rules, angered hundreds and thousands of people, and refused to change his behavior. Regardless of his intent (research, pleasure from griefing), I think it's pretty safe to say his behavior was pretty dickish.<br/><br/>Guy,<br/><br/>Sure. I don't think I said the social rules are static entities. At a certain point, however, any reasonable person could see that Myers' behavior was an extreme social outlier. As you say, he was a social deviant. But he was not trying to renegotiate the social rules. Myers was trying to poke the hornets' nest to see what it did ("Garfinkeling"). Hey, look, the hornets are pissed. Meanwhile, the hornets are buzzing around, saying what a duckwaffle this guy with the stick is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219799/#Comment_219799" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T09:43:50+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  9:43AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 10:08AM by Thunder_God.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think every action in a social context is also an act that negotiates and re-negotiates the social rules, either by re-affirming them or challenging them.<br/><br/>Regardless of what are one's goals, it is the nature of the beast.

For purely competitive, non-social play such as one might expect in the kind of tournament you describe, this is broken design. In complex games, emergent play often produces unexpected stuff like this. (Look at the history of restricted and prohibited cards in Magic: The Gathering for a case in point.)<br/><br/>So the scenario designer deserves some of the credit for this situation. They have produce a scenario that allows a combination that always wins, putting all the emphasis on character creation (pre-game strategy) instead of character play (in-game tactics). That is very likely not what they meant to do.<br/><br/>The referee Alice deserves some of the credit for this situation, too. A scenario that allows one specific power to win through what seems to be a rules "loophole" doesn't seem fair. Alice obviously saw the need to change something (she ruled you don't earn XP for exploiting the the teleport-to-pit death), but missed the point: the loophole is a clear-win strategy, which is generally poor game design. Alice should have either forbidden the teleport power, forbidden teleport into the pit ("it's a no-teleport zone"), removed the pit, or changed the effect of the pit (say, it does 1d10 damage instead of instant death). This requires a lot of Alice (she has to think like a game designer for some of those choices). If Alice didn't want to tread into that territory though, she shouldn't have changed the XP award rules for the loophole. It's also shitty that Alice refuses to rule one way or another. Pointing at the rules might be a ruling. Tacitly complicit, I suppose.<br/><br/>Catherine is sorta up shit creek. On the one hand, she keeps trying so there's something to be said about her re-engaging in non-fun activities to her own detriment. On the other hand, because Alice won't respond to her complaints, Catherine's options are limited: try new strategies or not play at all. It might take more than one game to figure out that there isn't gonna be any fun here for her. I'm hesitant to say she's responsible for the situation she's in, but after a certain point, she needs to extricate herself from it or it IS her responsibility. Also, why doesn't Catherine try the teleport strategy herself? (Because she is playing by what she thinks is a fair interpretation of the rules, I gather, which do not include exploiting this loophole. She'd rather lose than cheat this way to win?)<br/><br/>Beatrice gets some of the credit for the situation, right? She found a loophole and is "exploiting" it. Absent of any social pressure not to do this, she wins the tournament over and over. The design allows it. The scenario makes it super groovy. The referee allows it (but hints that it's a bit unfair by nerfing the XP -- why isn't Beatrice enraged over that?). Catherine's complaints probably seem to Beatrice like Catherine is being a sore loser. After all, one person's (Catherine's) opinions carry no more weight than Beatrice's, and Alice isn't saying anything to the contrary. <br/><br/>Now if there were a hundred people saying it was unfair, and they had interpreted the "loophole" as unfair and out-of-bounds for the past year or more at the last five tournaments, then Beatrice would be on different ground...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219847/#Comment_219847" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T12:20:07+00:00" title="July 21, 2009 12:20PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Now if there were a hundred people saying it was unfair, and they had interpreted the "loophole" as unfair and out-of-bounds for the past year or more at the last five tournaments, then Beatrice would be on different ground...</blockquote>\nWhy?<br/>Suppose we look at Magic: the Gathering, where you know the DCI tends to ban and restrict cards quite often, when deemed necessary.<br/>Now, someone wins with a certain combo at three tournaments in a row, and the DCI doesn't ban or restrict any cards used in this combo, and even go out to say that they're not going to ban it at the time, why should a player using such a combo be in a different situation?<br/>Heck, even if the combo isn't banned, and the DCI doesn't comment on it, why should she be in a different situation?<br/><br/>Suppose someone gets a powerful deck-list from the net, and buys all the cards.

So, Alice isn't compensating, just clarifying a rule.<br/><br/>Catherine cannot use the Teleport power because she does not have a mini with that power (much like, in the original Case of Dr. Myers (coming soon to a Lovecraftian bookseller near you!), other players cannot just chargen up a Teleporter and join in the fray, they have to grind for months to get up to snuff).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219860/#Comment_219860" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T12:56:49+00:00" title="July 21, 2009 12:56PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mikael,<br/><br/>I think Alice's ruling here is a bit on the "guns don't kill people; bullets kill people" tip. If Teleportation is a valid "attack" power, then it does damage via positioning and indirect damage effects and should earn XP. If Teleportation is not a valid "attack" power, then it should not be allowed to do damage via indirect damage effects and it should not earn XP. I think Alice made a poor (inconsistent) ruling, but hey, that's just my opinion. I can see her point of view but I don't think it's the best ruling. Alice, watching Beatrice defeat Catherine over and over, must think that Beatrice is pretty clever and condone the strategy. <br/><br/>If Catherine doesn't have the option to try the teleport strategy once it's apparent it's a game-breaker, then the game is pretty broken. There is one winning strategy. If you didn't figure it out, you don't get to win. Furthermore, are we not in a situation where Beatrice is never winning (and not earning XP) and Catherine is winning (but not earning XP)?

There are different paradigms, different formulas we employ in different situations. When waiting in a bank's queue you're not supposed to behave as you do when you're in a moshpit, for instance.<br/><br/>In a tournament, part the social contract is: Use all the cards you can to win.<br/>The "Don't be a dick" part, I was at first going to say, "It has no part in a tournament setting, you do what you're doing to win," but that's just not true. If someone forces you to shuffle, to replace your deck-protectors, who does not excuse anything you do once you touch a card, etc. then they're being dicks and it is not socially acceptable, though you get annoyed, and let them play, because it is <i>legit</i>.<br/><br/>So, it's not that "Don't be a dick" has no room in a tournament, because it does. Using a certain strategy that is card dependant, that has no room in the "Being a dick" part. That's what the tournament is about.<br/><br/>Heck, it's like telling someone not to backstab anyone in a game of Diplomacy. It's putting in irrelevant parts of Social Contracts; Social Contracts from other configurations, other social cases.<br/><br/>The thing about the Black Vise, it's not that using a Black Vise is dickish, it's that saying it's dickish in a tournament setting is having an oddly skewed view of what you do in tournaments... Yes. That's not what tournaments are about, and if it were, we'd just have everyone use the exact same cards, and have each deck look the same.<br/>Except we do have the first. Everyone has access to the same card-pool, at least in theory.<br/><br/>And this again, is all about handicapping, it's not really about being dickish.

It's a choice referees worldwide would disagree upon, because the rules do not clearly describe the situation (and it's complicated by the fact that there are no hard and fast rules for "morale").

And in games with fairly involved rules...especially rules accreted over many years...there are lots of edge cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if the scenario came down from the top with no clarification or commentary on the pit, any group of refs worth the title should have huddled up, reached a decision, and announced and enforced it on their own initiative (barring immediate access to higher tourney "authorities" or some sort of organizational bylaws that define a different procedure).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's probably less true in a CCG or CMG tourney where the system is completely rebooted every couple of years, but still pretty important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219916/#Comment_219916" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T14:45:31+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  2:45PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, you said something I disagree with, well, not entirely disagree with directly, but with where it leads to; regarding "Depriving someone with a <i>real chance</i>at winning."<br><br>I'll begin with the lesser point first, and I'll leave VTES aside, because I'm talking one-on-one games. If you can't win against me, does it matter you can win against everyone else? This is what is called "Meta-gaming", where we have rock-paper-scissors. If you're the only rock, and everyone else but me is paper, should I stay out of the tournament or give you an automatic win, because your rock is going to meet many papers it'd defeat, whereas I'm going to get stomped by everyone else?

I *did* forget the "Alice rules that no XP for pitting" bit--to which I would strenuously object, if she popped that without the huddle with the whole crew and/or the designer and/or the Sanctioning Body (if such). In that way, I agree with Grant: the design didn't say "into pit = death but no XP" it said "into pit = death" full stop. So Alice broke the situation and, yep, Bea should sweep the tournie on wins AND XP (or slam into another player who guessed/strategized that TP would be Uber, given the map).<br/><br/>Guy, I think ya sort of lost me. i was positing a tournie structure that, ultimately, hinges on XP totals, NOT mere survival. As such (and with Alice's adjudication that pit death &lt;&gt; XP), Bea's TP strategy is not "playing to win" because she won't ever get XPs; and many tournie rules will ban a player for such play (not just VTES, with which I'm most familiar, knowing its designer and several tournie hosts, including those at DragonCon).<br/><br/>But let us take this back to its origin, before the seriel numbers were filed off. We KNOW this about the tournie (if this thread is to be a generalization):<br/>* XPs benefit your side in a LONG TERM way, irrespective of this momentary battle which may or may not be part of a larger tournie.<br/>* But winning this battle (and the whole tounie) just comes down to attaining objectives--in this thread, elimination or last man standing.<br/><br/>SO (setting aside that Alice prolly shoulda STFU about the "no XP" thing, or gotten corroboration)...<br/>* Bea is playing fine, from the agenda of tournie winning, and Cath should STFU. She's gonna win this tounie, and damned be her army's overall progress.<br/>* Cath is playing fine (presumably) by going for XP... but she's not taking the maximal strategy for the tournie or battle, else she'd be doing the Uber Combo of TP+Pit. Down the road, her army's XP will be higher, the terrain will be different, and she can mop up Bea's underpowered, over-specialized army.<br/><br/>At least... as I see it. The generalized example is as problematic as the CoH/CoV one: conflicting goals and conflicting short v. long term gains. Put simply: everyone's right, if you know their actual objective for playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220140/#Comment_220140" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T11:49:15+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 11:49AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2009 11:49AM by Quintin Stone.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>If</i> the powers have explicit labels -- for example, "attack" or "utility" -- then it makes sense under the rules as provided that a death due to teleport would not give XP.

A company discovers a way to profit from a loophole in a law. But the loophole goes against the law's stated intent and may have negative impact on society at large. But if one company doesn't take advantage of the loophole, their competitors will. Which means greater profits. Which is also leverage to cut prices and squeeze out their competition even further (those who seize the loophole can benefit in multiple ways and those who don't can suffer in multiple ways). Law makers adapt to shut down the loophole but it takes time. And there are always new loopholes. Systematically, a company isn't incentivized (in the short term or in an easily measurable manner) to do what's ethical. And what's ethical doesn't help a side win or stay in business. There is the negative impact certain actions can have on a brand's image. But many companies look at that as a minor setback as they can use their quickly and massively acquired profits to alter their image in the long term.
