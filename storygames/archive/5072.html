Canonical settings provide you with lots of information. They require you to keep up with the setting material that other people produce. There are great advantages to this: someone else is producing setting material for you, they probably put a lot of thought and maybe research into making it all click and work, you can share and talk about the setting with people not in your group, you have a feeling that this world exists outside of yourself, and so on.<br/><br/>Evocative settings provide you with a tone, and with snippets, but not with the big picture. They require you to fill in the gaps, but they allow you to fill them in the way you want to. The advantages I see about evocative settings are that you can take part in that bigger creative process of creating it during play together rather than learning it, you can connect dots in-game and on the fly, you can tweak the setting the way you like it, and there's no "getting it wrong" in a way (though you need group buy-in, of course).<br/><br/>There are reasons why some games work better with one type rather than the other.<br/><br/>What do you think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114489/#Comment_114489" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T19:24:02+00:00" title="December 14, 2007  7:24PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I'd like to take a few canon heavy settings, and rework them as evocative settings.

Really bizarre settings or settings that draw on influences and source material I know nothing about are basically useless to me in an evocative state, because I don't have the right tools to have fun with them.<br/><br/>And canonical settings work better for me when they're presented in discrete, highly-factual chunks ("History" and "Religion" and "Geography" and so on), ideally with lots of sidebars, plot seeds, suggested uses, and authors' explanations that I can think about when I'm deciding what parts of the setting I want to keep and what parts I should gut and replace with something cooler.  Canonical settings which are only presented through some kind of muddy, rambling, in-character story (a faux-evocative approach, maybe?) are harder to sift through and take more time to rip apart and reassemble into something fun.<br/><br/>That may actually be the only way I can tell the difference between "evocative" and "canonical," now that I think about it -- with evocative settings, I'm looking for clues and hints about what I can fit into them, while with canonical settings I'm looking for hints about what I can remove from them.  And really, at that point it's a distinction without real difference, isn't it?  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114491/#Comment_114491" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T19:55:31+00:00" title="December 14, 2007  7:55PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2007 7:56PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, "canon" means "people not at my table claim an ongoing right to judge our group fiction", which I frankly loathe.<br/><br/>This might be semantics.

We read a few excerpts from the book, and I felt like I had a real grasp on the world and what is was like... and yet almost nothing was described in any concrete terms. It was just a powerful image, with blurry edges. If we had to summarize the information in terms of Geography, Politics, etc, we would probably have ended up with three or four lines of text, tops.<br/><br/>(Note: I didn't get a chance to read the whole book. Maybe there's a lot more in there! But what we read outloud was enough to play.)<br/><br/>My take on this is:<br/><br/>If you're going to have "canonical" information for a setting, make sure as much of it as possible is going to work itself into the actual, real game you'll be playing at the table. If each bit of your setting is something that the players will be interacting with, you're doing well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114504/#Comment_114504" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T21:57:26+00:00" title="December 14, 2007  9:57PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Christian,<br/><br/>I've been thinking a lot about setting, mostly coming at it from the angle of context and focus.  <br/><br/>One strong point of a lot of canon settings is that they often give you enough information and context to hook into it, to actually care.  "Aliens attack humanity" means nothing- "Cylons infiltrate your band of survivors" means something- if you've got the context.  This is one of  the places where I point to L5R as being a great game at providing story snippets and intriguing NPCs as a way of building a network of context that the players can care about.<br/><br/>To balance that, most canon settings also suffer from bloat.  This is for a number of reasons but an important design reason is simply when you make a setting for others you don't necessarily know if what you're making is going to be interesting to them or not- so you just make a LOT of stuff and hope that something sticks.  (This proved to be a big design concern when I wrote Well of Souls as a HeroQuest adventure).  <br/><br/>Too much of this information and the group gets lost- they don't know what to do with it.  You get players who've memorized the 200 star routes but can't get into the gung-ho action of Star Wars anymore.  You have half the group who just looked at the pictures and the other half that have memorized thousands of pages of canon.  Instead of the setting bringing the group together- it leads them apart.  You've lost focus.<br/><br/>Evocative settings tend to work better in this case, because the information is often vague or very light- the focus is on evoking color and mood for play- keeping it the focus.  The key depends on whether players get enough from it and the steps of the game to gel into a cohesive unit and start building context for themselves.  Polaris and Falling Leaves both do a good job of using the rules to quickly help the group hone in on what matters and build strong context throughout play.  Games with evocative settings where the group doesn't figure out how to build context quickly fall apart- it seems a fair amount of failed Sorcerer and Burning Wheel play are examples of this.<br/><br/>Honestly, I really like both.  The only thing I'm not down with is useless setting- stuff that is quite tertiary to actual play.  (Iron Kingdoms, I'm looking at you and your whole chapter of astronomy that made my eyes bleed).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip" title="King Turnip"><img alt="King Turnip" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip">King Turnip</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114513/#Comment_114513" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-15T01:40:00+00:00" title="December 15, 2007  1:40AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In short: Dude, what Chris said.<br/><br/>Ptolus is a great cannonical setting, if you can remember all of the thousand pages of details (or are willing to pause frequently, it has a beautiful layout that speeds lookups.)  My group had a hell of a lot of fun there, but we ignored almost the entire book.  One player got dropped because he wouldn't stop trying to argue facts about the city.  The street address of Rastor's Weapons Emporium was more important to him than the plot.  There's always that one guy....<br/><br/>A Game of Thrones d20 has something that I've seen in a lot of licensed settings (which are by definition cannonical.)  It demands a very thourough understanding of the setting and then yells "HANDS OFF!  Don't touch these cannon characters!"  If I want to put a spike in Tyrion Lannister's eye, I'm going to do it, and I don't care if Mr. Martin thinks I have played his character right.  Live with it.  Another fault with licensed cannon is having to break the rules to create the cannon characters, or (Star Wars d6, I'm looking at you) the cannon characters are invariably godlike, no matter how feeble or miniscule they were in the original fiction.<br/><br/>Another common flaw of cannonical settings is metaplotting, but that's a rant for a different thread.<br/><br/>Evocitave settings work really well for me, but hey, I'm lazy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114517/#Comment_114517" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-15T04:00:40+00:00" title="December 15, 2007  4:00AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2007 4:06AM by Ry.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Keeping Christian's terminology for the purpose of his thread).  <br/><br/>I like canonical settings as tools to write evocative settings.

The only contexts where this matters to multiple groups is:<br/><br/>1) Networked LARP.<br/><br/>2) Shooting the breeze on the internet.<br/><br/>Networked LARPs have all kinds of complex issues that can't be solved with pat prescriptions because it's inherently difficult to immerse several thousand people in a common setting -- because it's difficult to work with several thousand people in pretty much any participatory format. It allows some kinds of play that can't exist in any other form, though.<br/><br/>Internet-wise, canon discussions aren't much different than other media fandom discussions. Nobody really gives a shit about how people play at their own table and the conversation almost never has anything to do with that. The do care about the baseline assumptions of the larger social network and how media "ought" to be interpreted. I can read these same sentiments here on this board about how Serenity/Firefly should be gamed. If online discussions about NPCs in Vampire are bullshit, most of the media-based gaming discussion anywhere is most assuredly the same kind of bullshit. In my view, the fact that one is lambasted and the other is not is just another instance of gamers denigrating their own cultural production, because the implication is that film, literature et al has the privilege of being immune to gamer alteration. Reading conversations where the same people who dislike game canon/metaplot insist that the One True Way to play Firefly is with Game X spring to mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114524/#Comment_114524" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-15T06:24:58+00:00" title="December 15, 2007  6:24AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. I think I may object to one element of the definition of a canon setting - specifically: "They require you to keep up with the setting material that other people produce. "  There are certainly settings for which this is true, but there are many more for which it is not, ranging from single single source material to material which has finished its run and is simply not getting any more additions.  Whether it's a now defunct game line like Planescape, a finished series, like Amber or a free-standing source like Neverwhere, it can be canon, but not require anything more than a manageable core.<br/><br/>I'll go a step further and suggest that there is much more range within the idea of a canon game than this pairing suggests.  Sure, there is the canon game that clings loyally to the source material over all else, but I think that's pretty rare. There's the canon game with general modifications, where a few things have been changed for convenience or stylistic reasons.  This can be problematic, since without a pattern to the changes, the canon becomes more a source of confusion than reference, which is why I'm much more fond of the canon with an explicit point of departure.  For this, consider the now-famous example from the Sons of Kryos - starting a forgotten realms game by killing Elminster.  This clearly says "Canon is a useful reference up to this point, but from this point on, we've taken ownership." and is much easier to play. A similar effect can be had with taking a single element and adding, subtracting, or transforming it in an explicit way - Playing 7th Sea but with an Africa analog, or Star Wars where the Sith are Githyanki.<br/><br/>And all of those versions of playing with canon still don't cover the even broader use of canon for thematic purposes.  This is what allows for mashups (like the star wars/Dune Mash up that Judd was running) or pastiche (Such as amber games with no recognizable characters from the books).  If I run a game that is Zelazny's "Night in the Lonesome October" only set in 1982 Florida, with a cast appropriate to the time and place (rather than a small town in Victorian-ish England, with an appropriate cast) it will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has read the book, but I am very far removed from the source material.<br/><br/>All of which is to say, that's a lot of very different ways to handle setting that would all be lumped under "canon" and I don't think it can take the strain.  Now, this is not to say I think that a discussion of what makes a setting evocative is not one to be had, but I think this particular dichotomy is false, and it disregards a lot of useful and powerful ideas about setting construction and use.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114527/#Comment_114527" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-15T06:40:37+00:00" title="December 15, 2007  6:40AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2007 6:41AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Christian, <i>Grey Ranks</i> might be an interesting game to chew on in this regard - you've got a lot of canonical setting material - here's a map, here's a date, here are some real people who did real things.  That stuff is really intended to frame up an evocative setting - here are situation elements, here are character creation choices that drive play.  So there are certain canonical assumptions you have to buy into regarding time, place, and sequence of events, but playitself does not hinge on those in any important way, provided you color within the broad lines.

Maybe I'm thinking of something slightly different wrt Canon-Heavy vs. Evocative.<br/><br/>Here's a quick example: I'm reading a setting book for Space 1889 and get to the NPCs section. Here's the problem: The NPCs are actually pretty interesting. There are several major hints on directions that stories could take that involve those characters. What isn't there is much on how to get your group's home-made PCs involved in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>Now, I could see the thing improved in a couple of ways:<br/>1) Open book the thing and have the players play the NPCs and develop stories based on the sketches of conflicts and personalities already in place, possibly adding a few implied characters ( one of the Prince's20 odd non-heir children, for example, or members of one of the Earthman pirate crews).<br/><br/>2) Use the existing NPCs as examples, then have the players create characters and relationships/situations that somehow parallel those issues that run through the text.<br/><br/>The non-viable solution (IMO) would be the one suggested by the game itself. Have the players make up whatever characters they feel like, as standard, then bang the setting and the charactes around a bit and pull it all together with narrative duct-tape.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114536/#Comment_114536" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-15T07:58:01+00:00" title="December 15, 2007  7:58AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AS I see it, the difference is less in what's "there" in the setting material (although highly specified setting material will tend towards being treated as more authoritative), and more in how the play group sees the material as having authority.<br/><br/>The tendency has always been to use text as a source of authority ("Canon"). This is great right up until there's a conflict of interpretation or power between people at the table. Then the lawyering comes out, which can really undermine the usual, moment-to-moment system at the table. There's also, secondarily, the problem of differential absorption of "canon" creating differential authority - the players who understand in detail how the setting logic "works" have more success at getting what they want in the fiction.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you have the setting-as-starting-point ("evocative") approach, where certain specific things are defined as having authority at the beginning of play, but reliance on texts after that point is minimal. This puts the focus for disputes right back on the people and their consensus system - the setting is essentially being filled in at the table through the play process.<br/><br/>In point of fact, as JD says, every table plays the second way. No setting is fully determined in the text, and individual interpretations of text will vary. But devotion to the <i>idea</i> of textual authority is a real phenomenon, encouraged both by general cultural forces and the "gaming industry"'s devotion to ever-expanding setting source material as revenue stream. You pay for all that setting, you want it to be worth something.<br/><br/>In general, I think acknowledging that the authority of text is something decided at the table rather than assumed is healthier for play, but the role of authoritative, detailed texts in creating convergence among individual imaginative content can't be neglected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114537/#Comment_114537" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-15T07:58:34+00:00" title="December 15, 2007  7:58AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The talk of evocative settings brings to mind my favorite line from <i>Snow Crash:</i> "To condense fact from the vapor of nuance." Basically what people do with these settings is take a mood and some images and make up the concrete stuff. This tends to make for the most improvisational and dynamic play, since everyone can simply take each other's ideas and run with 'em. (Play Unsafe's building on each other's ideas, in other words.) <br/><br/>As for canonical settings, eh. They're okay when done well, but the amount of prep and knowledge required can be intimidating. Like Bob I tend to pare them down, taking some elements I like, getting a mood for the thing through genre conventions and such (humanity on the brink of extinction! Renaissance steampunk!), and grabbing maybe a few adventure ideas and NPCs. <br/><br/>Continuing from the earlier quote: "[T]he human mind can absorb and process an incredible amount of information -- if it comes in the right format. The right interface. If you put the right face on it." What's the right face to put on an evocative setting to convey the right amount and kind of information? Lots of canonical settings have sample fiction to be more evocative, with hit-or-miss results. Books like, say, Polaris and Dogs in the Vineyard don't have any fiction, yet manage to convey the mood extremely well in a few short pages. Is it because fiction is too narrow in scope to pass along very useful information? <br/><br/>Some other differences I can think of: Both Polaris and Dogs have setting and rules in one book and complementing each other. The Wild West feel and religious backdrop of Dogs make dramatic extremes easy, and the horror-fairy tale feel of Polaris is well suited to the direction of the rules. Both books also have a lot of play examples that show not only how the rules work, but how the rules work in that setting. Same goes for a lot of story game greats. So maybe that's one way to present evocative setting effectively, by having them work with the rules and giving concrete examples.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114538/#Comment_114538" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-15T08:28:40+00:00" title="December 15, 2007  8:28AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2007 9:05AM by Malcolm Sheppard.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>Hmm. I think I may object to one element of the definition of a canon setting - specifically: "They require you to keep up with the setting material that other people produce. "  There are certainly settings for which this is true, but there are many more for which it is not, ranging from single single source material to material which has finished its run and is simply not getting any more additions.  Whether it's a now defunct game line like Planescape, a finished series, like Amber or a free-standing source like Neverwhere, it can be canon, but not require anything more than a manageable core.</blockquote>\nEDITED FOR DUMBNESS:<br/><br/>Popular perceptions don't matches up with how games that have "canon" are actually designed or used. Does anyone really think Vampire is impossible to play without all the books or that nobody does so? I sure don't; Mage is the only WoD line I'm a completist about that that's easy for me, because I've contributed to at least half of the line. I run Vampire regularly and it works just fine with the two corebooks. I know for a fact that few books are really designed as "must-haves." <br/><br/>As I said, big LARPs (and large chatserver play with 20+ characters) is different. The setting has to form a fictive culture to inhabit, so the more common knowledge (or sectarian knowledge) that's out there, the more tools it provides for players to work with the signs of that mythos. Even then, the result isn't a bunch of completists who need every book to play. This is easily confirmed when you look at procedures in these games, where there's typically a list of books that count, how they count and any changes. Players typically get anything that applies to their character. One of the reasons splatbooks do well is because people get them to support their LARP/chat PCs -- they don't buy every single one.<br/><br/>But at the typical table this isn't really a big deal. People play with what they have and don't lose anything for it. Equating, say chatserver GMs and Camarilla Storytellers' wants with what the average group needs is kind of like saying that every music fan has to be the guy who collects every bootleg, import recording and interview to functionally appreciate his favorite band.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114539/#Comment_114539" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-15T08:33:27+00:00" title="December 15, 2007  8:33AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2007 8:36AM by Malcolm Sheppard.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But devotion to the idea of textual authority is a real phenomenon, encouraged both by general cultural forces and the "gaming industry"'s devotion to ever-expanding setting source material as revenue stream.

If there was a Venn Diagram there'd probably be people who read this stuff like novels on one end, people who just want enough to inspire them on the other and people in the middle who enjoy the unfolding narrative and use it in play, I reckon.<br/><br/>We're playtesting John Wick's Houses of the Blooded and the setting is large and intense.

The issues around canon seem to be around people's need for adherence, once it exists.<br/><br/>Some folks want adherence by players at the table to the shared understanding of a place or culture. This restriction happens at different levels, for different groups. I think this is especially true for people who want immersion from gaming; they find that when people stray from the canon, it hurts their suspension of disbelief. But it can be insidious for more storytelling groups too,  who would like to encourage creativity but can find themselves responding to setting questions in a way that means the end up saying no to contraventions of canon. If a player asks, would or could, and the answer is negative - because that is what canon says - then it stifles creativity. I have been in the situation where I, without malice, kept shutting down a Gloranthan newbie, because she would ask 'would people do this' or 'would people do that' and I would respond from the canon as to what would be the norm. Now you might say that going against the norm is interesting, but breaking taboos is often not the desire when asking. The difficulty is strengthened because other players at the table may be relying on cultural facts: who you can marry for example, for conflicts essential to thier story. <br/><br/>So in some ways, the danger for settings with canon is that the detail becomes restrictive to the vision of people at the gaming table. However, even in an evocative setting we will still begin to establish facts as we play, so we close off avenues of creativity through precedent. I suspect many 'canon' settings began life as evocative settings that accreted more detail over time.<br/><br/>Shorter games may win here, because you get less accretion during the lifetime of the game, and you tend to reboot the setting more often, cleaning and paring back to the bones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114559/#Comment_114559" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-15T10:47:04+00:00" title="December 15, 2007 10:47AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>As a worker in the scarequote-gaming industry-unscarequote who produces setting material I can assure you that organizationally, top to bottom, nobody really gives a shit if your games use things as written.

Thanks.</blockquote>\nSure. Now, what was it you were asking again? \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>In another thread, I mentioned that the setting in Beast Hunters was purposefully evocative rather than canonical, and Shreyas expressed interest in talking about that, so: here we go. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>To start off, here's the way I see the distinction. Canonical settings provide you with lots of information. They require you to keep up with the setting material that other people produce. There are great advantages to this: someone else is producing setting material for you, they probably put a lot of thought and maybe research into making it all click and work, you can share and talk about the setting with people not in your group, you have a feeling that this world exists outside of yourself, and so on.<br/><br/>Evocative settings provide you with a tone, and with snippets, but not with the big picture. They require you to fill in the gaps, but they allow you to fill them in the way you want to. The advantages I see about evocative settings are that you can take part in that bigger creative process of creating it during play together rather than learning it, you can connect dots in-game and on the fly, you can tweak the setting the way you like it, and there's no "getting it wrong" in a way (though you need group buy-in, of course).<br/><br/>There are reasons why some games work better with one type rather than the other.<br/><br/>What do you think?</blockquote>\nAh! There we go! <br/><br/>In very broad terms, I can see where you're coming from. Personally, it's my experience that all game setting information is <i>meant</i> to be evocative, but there are some people who will take it as 'canon' and make it a hindrance to creativity, rather than an aid to creativity. On the plus side, evoking the setting has been largely done for you, and its easier to get your group on board, assuming they are fans of the setting. <br/><br/>As to which is better, objectively I cannot say. I <i>prefer</i> evocative settings, but I know that if I'm brain-dead and having trouble squeezing out enough imagination as it is, having canon to use as a prop comes in pretty damn handy. I think settings that you are inventing whole-cloth, unless you have a world-builder bug up your ass and can devote time and text to it, should probably be evocative so as to help you focus on the mechanics, and making sure that the players have something to do in the setting, without raising fears that the players are "stepping on canon."  I would prefer if the game books that had a lot of canon would, at some point, simply say, "This is where the canon ends, here on Day Zero. Where your players take it is up to them, and you. Go with confidence, and have fun."  Others may disagree, but I have to agree with JD on this one: the setting and fiction will end up being as "evocative" as the GM and players are willing to make it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114602/#Comment_114602" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-15T21:40:56+00:00" title="December 15, 2007  9:40PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All games work better, and worse, with the second type than with the first, because no game can be played the first way.

If you get together a group that expects to strictly adhere to a prewritten setting and you don't provide that, then you're not giving them what they want. If you make it clear that changes can be expected, then the fault rests with people who choose to participate nonetheless. Clearly describing how you'll make use of the text is a big help.<br/><br/>"Evocative" settings? That depends on how players interpret particular signs. There is text, not telepathy; you can hope for common interpretations of those signs but you can never expect them, and those points of divergence can bear real creative fruit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114619/#Comment_114619" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-16T04:38:53+00:00" title="December 16, 2007  4:38AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Christian, thanks for posting, and Chris, thanks for what you said in your blog.

But there's no continuity at all, no myth of ancient elder vampires, the Camarilla collapsed along with the Roman empire, there is no Tremere clan, no Sabbat, no Jyhad, no prophecies of Gehenna.  In short, it's a different game.  <br/><br/>But on the subject of Vampire, I remember an online game I played in where one of the most powerful characters ended up killing and eating Sascha Vykos, a big scary NPC in the Sabbat faction.  There were two types of horrified reaction by the other players: "Dude, you can't kill Sascha Vykos, he's too important for that!"  The other, which was directed more to the GM's, was "Dude, you can't kill Sascha Vykos and <i>expect things to go on as usual</i>."

What's the situation presented in VtR? You have a bunch of characters in a broody factionalized Anne Riceriffic world. The same as in VtM. Oh sure, this NPC or that NPC might or might not be in a gaming book somewhere, but the decision to include them at the table or not include them, to make them vulnerable or invulnerable, is all up to the individual gaming group.

You are doing something with the setting that has no connection to the original work. The game in which you seduce Leia, steal the Falcon from Han and paint Darth Vader purple is just as destructive of Star Wars as any of these ideas. The Death Star was not created and destroyed for just any old reason, it was created and destroyed as a prop in <i>that story</i> involving <i>those characters</i> in <i>that way.</i> And the same is true for everything from costumes to writing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115443/#Comment_115443" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T17:50:01+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  5:50PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>No, there really is no canon<i>in play.</i></blockquote>\nI was going to quote your earlier post, but this sums it up better.  This is the core of the matter.<br/><br/>Canon is what has officially happened. Evocative is what might happen.<br/><br/>A canon heavy game has a lot of backstory. An evocative game has a lot of potential story.  Exalted is canon heavy, but there are a ton of seeds for stories to spring from and play, so it's also very evocative.  Lord of the Rings is hugely canonical. It's not very evocative, because the point where the story ends, there's not really anything left to explore. Lots of indie games are light on the canon and heavy on the evocation - Beast Hunters, Shadow of Yesterday, Hero's Banner, etc. There's not much light canon, low evocation in gaming, for a good reason, the only thing that comes to mind is the Army of Darkness RPG (although I hear they did a hell of a job putting seeds in for new stories).<br/><br/>On the subject of Vampire, and most of the WoD, it's really cool how you can dial the canon to suit you. The only required book is the core book, everything else is considered optional, expressely non-canonical.  Some of their supplements even have multiple options for some facet of the backstory, so even when you have the official "truth" there's multiple versions and the ST gets to pick which one is true, or use them to inspire a different truth.  They're all about being as evocative as possible, and letting the end user decide if they want a lot of canon or very little.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115464/#Comment_115464" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T21:38:57+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  9:38PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I <i>loathe</i> canonical settings with a burning passion, as a result of several games I've played that dragged major ass.

I don't know if it's trying to keep all the details straight and the amount of homework (read: time wasted) required to learn all these details, or just the way that PCs will inevitably end up playing second fiddle to the "real" movers and shakers. Also, if you want to run a game "inspired by" a particular canonical setting, it's still kinda tough to break social expectations of the real diehards of the setting material.<br/><br/>Evocative settings are, frankly, the only pre-published "setting" material I can be bothered with anymore.
