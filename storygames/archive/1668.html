                    Nobilis--one of my favorite but unplayed games--rewards players this way:<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Every time there is a successful and enjoyable game session--that is, everyone had fun--the characters receive a Dynasty Point [which can be spent to buy resources for the group as a whole].  At the completion of each successful, enjoyable story--one where every player had fun in most of the sessions--the players choose whether to receive one new character point [which can be spent to buy things for that character] or a chancel point [used on the team's HQ].</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
What I do not like about this--and keep in mind, I haven't played--is that it encourages players to say they had fun, regardless of whether they did or not.  You don't want to be the one hold-out, saying, "Naw, this sucked.  No XP for all of us, then.  Try again next time."  It's bad because it incentivizes a reaction, and also does it at the end of the game, when it's too late to fix it.<br/>
<br/>
A potentially better approach: use something like Fan Mail in PTA.  Each player has a stack of individualized tokens.  Every time another player does something to make you say "Whoa, cool!", award that player a token.  You can only receive one token per scene, but can award as many as there are players.  Once you get a token from all the players, you can redeem them for points.  (Nobilis has like 3 different kinds of reward points, I'm not sure how this would break down just yet.)  There's still the Oscar the Grouch problem, but it's obvious during play, and can be addressed in real-time.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone tried the rules-as-written?  How does it work out?  Am I making too much out of a non-problem?  What other variant rules have people used?<br/>
<br/>
Plus, I finally figure out some <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.nerdnyc.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=25307" rel="nofollow">applications of the Never Say "No" principle which had not been obvious to me.</a> </div>

                            Um, I'm not sure exactly what Rebecca was intending here, but, if a player is not having fun in most of the sessions of a story arc... why are they playing?  I think that means you have more problems than just dealing with the reward system.  I think the game assumes that everybody will be having fun nearly all the time.  Because, otherwise, what the hell are you doing?                        </div>

<p>James, I think you are seeing a ghost of a problem that isn't there.</p>
<p>I have not played a game, any game, in which it isn't abundantly clear when someone isn't having fun. The Nobilis rule simply informs you that it's everyone's responsibility to cultivate everyone's shared fun.</p>

                            Shreyas, Jonathan: <br><br>The Nobilis rule does do that, but it doesn't always do that in a functional way. I have watched, with my own eyes, Nobilis games in which it was pretty obvious someone didn't have fun only to say that they did at the end so everyone could get their points. <br><br>The Nobilis rule, IME, works very well when you already have a functional group with a functional social contract. It doesn't, however, offer a lot in the way of help, support, or fast-fail in the moment encouragment like most of the rest of the system does. Something that brings those issues out and supports resolving the Oscar the Grouch in a fast-fail method and gives real-time feedback would probably work for a lot of groups. <br><br>As always, "Because I personally don't need it" isn't a reason that others might actually want it.<br><br>James, <br/><br/>So, it seems like you're going for something kind of like Full Light's script system -- you only get rewards after you've earned everyone else's buyin? <br/><br/>Do you want to have them give you the tokens for any "woo cool" moment, or for specific things? Like getting tokens that can be cashed in for MPs for cool on the moment stunts, but getting ones that give Dynasty Points for doing something that specifically reinforces someone else's story -- that is, using your turn at the plate to advance someone else's story over your own. <br/><br/>I think it sounds like it could be a good idea, but my gut tells me that just giving "wow cool" points is missing an opportunity to do something slightly more advanced.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            In actual play, it's always the GM who ends up tracking Dynasty Points, because the players don't give two hoots about them. <br/><br/>The <em>only</em> time a player ever cares about Dynasty Points is when they have tapped out their MPs and are up against an opponent they desperately want to prevail against. Then they ask the HG how many Dynasty Points the group has, ask the other players if they can spend them, and then they spend them like water.  <br/><br/>As an HG, you could roll a twenty sided die to figure out how many DPs the group has each time, and the players couldn't tell, because they never give a second's thought to that number, except at the occasional moments when they want to open the magical firehose.                        </div>

                            Neel, <br/><br/>Sure, any specific details you're looking for? <br/><br/>I'll note that the group in question had a long history of denial and passive-agressiveness in game. Everyone would smile at each other at the end of game and say how fun it was, then go home to their SOs and bitch for an hour. It wasn't a healthy group, and so I don't blame Nobilis at all for their failures. I do, however, think that a similar group with a slightly less embeded problem could be helped by some more real-time feedback issues. <br/><br/>(Or, it is equally possible they'd just give into peer preasure in the moment and give tokens they didn't actually want to give, in order to avoid being the difficult one. The deeps of dysfunction can be shocking sometimes.) <br/><br/>I, however, am surprised to hear about your DP experience. I've often had players who were very interested in DPs and in progressing their Imperator and such-like. What kind of roles do you find DPs and Imperator issues playing in your games, if I might ask, and do you think that feeds back into the issue at all?                        </div>

Brand, that goes for the whole game. I would never play Nobilis, Amber, PTA, or any game that was not super-tightly structured without a fairly strong Social Contract. This has become very clear to me at StoryGames Boston where there are people who I gel with more or less well.  It the group gels well, we can play anything. We could freeform all night long. If the group doesn't gel, then pass me Agon or TSOY or something that I can run fairly strictly (though you can run both of these more loose too), so I can arbitrate disputes or rough spots without ruining play.                        </div>

                            In practice, that rule is totally borked.<br/><br/>Practically, advancement in Nobilis is not-at-all fast enough anyway.  How about just a fan-mail system?

Are you incentivizing going big or going home in order to make every scene more explosive?

                            In my experience as a player and a GM, Imperators tended to be highly inscrutable and distant. Their distance and incomprehensibility were tools to let the players do whatever they liked, because distance meant they wouldn't micromanage PCs, and incomprehensibilty justified them approving of PCs following apparently violently-contradictory agendas. <br/><br/>Imperators were used in-game mainly as crucibles to force conflict towards resolution. For example, as an HG, I had an Imperator order half the PCs to punish a PC for disobeying its orders and protecting his mortal wife. Then it ordered the other half to protect the PC and his wife from harm, because it had a Code that said love was the highest principle. Finally, it promised them <em>all</em> horrible punishments if any of them failed. The Imperator's commands do make a kind of emotional sense, even though you can't find any rational agenda that they satisfy.  (The players actually did manage to pull a happy ending out of their hats in this case, if you're curious. Ask Nick -- Mr. Teapot -- for the details; he was in the game.)<br/><br/>I guess that Imperator advancement wasn't a big deal, because they were neither active agents nor really useful resources for the players. Their evolution was mostly thematic; in the game I described, the Imperator was seeking a new Code, and its Powers were ordered to find principles for it to follow. So at each milepost in the game it adopted a new principle based on the players' story.                        </div>

                            Neel, <br/><br/>First game of Nobilis I ever played that was the setup, and in reflection, the same result happened with DPs. In fact, at one point one of the players even said something along the lines of "What is a DP anyway? You mean there are XPs for asshole over there?" <br/><br/>Other games with more active Imperators, however, had a much different focus on DPs. <br/><br/>Shreyas, <br/><br/>Sometimes I did call people on it. However, I wasn't the GM in this group and was an odd man out in a game of couples so my social weight in the game was limited. Its hard to call a person on lying when everyone else at the table will back them up about it in the moment, even if they all know you're probably right. So when I'd say, "Are you sure, you didn't get invovled almost the whole game" the whole table would leap in to defend the "attacked" person. Geek social fallacies at work. <br/><br/>But, lest the group sound too horrible, they were very good at other things around game. No one was consistantly unhappy (that I remember or could read), and so there is a gain-loss analysis that goes on in deciding how hard you want to push things and how much its your job to try and fix other people who don't want to be fixed. Some mechanical backing from the system might have made a nice place to get a shoe in the door, and lacking that I had to decide, as adults decide, if I wanted a war or not.<br/><br/>This group and this game I decided not.                        </div>

                            Yeah,  the problem isn't the players thinking, "God, this sucks."  First, that's usually quite obvious.  Second, it's a self-correcting problem: one way or another, it's going to get resolved at the player-level.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is players thinking, "Hey, that was all right... I guess..." which is harder to diagnose, and doesn't always get resolved quickly.  The person is telling a little white lie for the sake of politeness, and it's tricky to call them on it tactfully.  The Nobilis rule-as-written gives them an extra incentive to do this.  (The rule, of course, is a pretty small factor, since the social incentives are very strong, but still it's not optimal.)<br/>
<br/>
The root phenomenon has nothing to do with gaming, nor with (specifically-) geek social fallacies.  Sometimes people stay in relationships (jobs, friendships, marriages, etc) where they're bored, or dissatisfied, but not unhappy--or at least, not unhappy enough to break things off.  So you just coast for a while, and procrastinate on the hard work until there's a crisis or a better opportunity.                        </div>

Considering after each story arc the enjoyment she had motivated her to get more involved in the game and enjoy herself a lot more by the end of the campaign.

                            This isn't a Rules Tweak, because I don't have the Designer-Fu to fix it, but it's an observation.  A lot of the special stuff you can buy, like certain Gifts, are way lame.  "Perfect Timing," for example, allows characters to always be there in the nick of time for things.  Like, I don't know *any* game system where the PC's don't have that just by virtue of being PC's.    I wonder how one would make such a gift cooler?  In the game, it's worth a lot more than invulnerability or the ability to breathe fire...                        </div>

I'm not sure that the Monarda Law offers such ironclad protection of player narrative input as all that. I believe that the way it explicitly works is that you can't say "no" but you can say "well no not quite". I believe that the options you get are explicitly layed out as:<br/><br/>"You can do that, but it'll cost you"<br/>"You can't do that, but you can do this!"<br/>"You can try!"<br/><br/>So (to take the example from the initial, linked-to thread) if the players say "We capture his sister" the GM is, within the spirit of the Monarda Law, completely entitled to say "he doesn't have a sister" so long as he qualifies it with something else with broadly the same connotations ("...but he has a dog which he cares about very much").<br/><br/>Similarly, like the "encased in amber" thing, you can also say "you can try to kidnap his sister, but she's an /unbelievable badass/" or otherwise hose the idea while remaining completely within the scope of the Monarda Law.<br/><br/>Finally, the issue with the Monarda Law is that it's presented very much as GM advice, not as a game rule, so the GM *can* always ignore it (compare with, for example, the Let it Ride rule in Burning Wheel which states, very explicitly, that the GM cannot ask a player for a second check against the same ability, and if they do they are cheating).<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, I do *like* the Monarda Law, I just think that it's less of a big thing than some people make out. I think it's a step in the right direction, but it's a smaller step than it looks.<br/><br/>(Edited to add)<br/><br/>The Dynasty Point thing strikes me as a similar problem, actually. It looks an awful lot like the designer was torn between awarding XP at the end of the session automatically, and having a more complicated reward mechanism, and went with a slightly iffy compromise.<br/><br/>(Edited again to add)<br/><br/>Just checked the book, "You can't do that but you can do this" must come from somewhere else. The third option I was trying to remember was "How?" and the Monarda Law as writ still gives fairly explicit GM Veto over player contributions.                        </div>

                            I haven't looked at the text in a little while, but you're right: the <b>Never Say "No" Principle</b> doesn't mean the GM can't hose the players.  But it does mean that the GM can't say, "Nah, that's conceptually wrong from the get-go."  What the players want to try is at least possible, which means the GM has to make some adjustments to the imaginary world.<br/>
<br/>
Even if the duke doesn't have a sister, or a dog, or a favorite servant, he used to have a sock-monkey that he loved more than anything in the world--but he threw it in the furnace at age 12, when he realized the unhealthy power it had over his thoughts, and scattered the ashes across the land.  Here, the GM is trying pretty hard to hose the players a little, but the GM has to <i>work</i> for it.  In fact, instead of a hose, it's concrete mixer: the GM is building onto the imaginary world to keep the players far away, instead of closing doors in their faces to keep them out.  The players, if they're persistent, can explore these new additions, and figure out something else to do.  More importantly, the scene which the GM intended to be about how hard-assed the Duke can be, ends up being all about funky miracles and player scheming.  As it should be.<br/>
<br/>
You know, is Trollbabe's conflict declaration stuff a little bit like this?  I don't have the rules with me.  If I recall, Trollbabe has this thing where anybody can call for a conflict, and the predicate of the conflict has to exist even if nobody established it.  Player says: "Conflict: I watch out for goblin-ninjas!"  GM: "Um, what goblin-ninjas?" and no matter what happens with the dice, those goblin-ninjas are there now, skulking about.                        </div>

I'm not talking about what she *means*. I'm talking about what she *says*.<br/><br/>There are two important thing about what she says:<br/><br/>Firstly, unlike the rule in Trollbabe (apparently, although I haven't got the game so I don't know for sure) the Monarda Law *isn't* a rule, it's a guideline, a piece of GM advice. It's given in-character by Idaly St-Germain and what it says is "If you wish to make sure that you do not slip and accidentally place your established story over the fun of the players in the game, a strict adherence to the Monarda Law shall save your soul from peril."<br/><br/>This is not, in any sense, system protection.<br/><br/>Secondly, the options you are given instead of saying "No" two are actually just "No" by the back door. Specifically you are told (by "Idaly") that you should say (and I quote):<br/><br/>"Yes" if their course of action seems innocuous and interesting.<br/>"How?" if you don't see any way they can do it.<br/>"You can try!" if it seems possible but unlikely.<br/>"Yes, but there's a catch" if you can think of a good catch.<br/><br/>Of these three answers "How" and "You can try" are almost identical to saying "No". In fact they're arguably worse, because now instead of the GM being the Arbiter of Reality, he has become the Arbiter of Cool. Suddenly instead of the GM saying "no, you can't kidnap the guy's sister, because he hasn't got one" the GM is instead saying "you can only kidnap the guy's sister if you can *convince* me that kidnapping his sister is *cooler* than what I have in mind."<br/><br/>Nothing in the actual, textual description of the Monarda Law makes it into anything even resembling system protection of player creative input.                        </div>

                            Dan: those four options--Yes, how, you can try, yes but--exist in all other RPG's.  They're just unstated.  Any time you're in a dungeon with your elf and dwarf, and you're facing a trap, and the player comes up with something the GM never considered, the GM's gotta use one of those responses.  Or he can uses a fifth option: 'No, that's wrong.'  Nobilis gets rid of the 'no that's wrong' as an option.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to make a big distinction between rules and GM advice, that's okay, but I don't see it.  GM advice is just soft rules.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>Dan: those four options--Yes, how, you can try, yes but--exist in all other RPG's.  They're just unstated.  Any time you're in a dungeon with your elf and dwarf, and you're facing a trap, and the player comes up with something the GM never considered, the GM's gotta use one of those responses.  Or he can uses a fifth option: 'No, that's wrong.'  Nobilis gets rid of the 'no that's wrong' as an option.</blockquote>
But leaves the four other options completely intact. Which is sort of my point. I have *never* in a roleplaying game, had a plan just vetoed outright by the GM, they have *always* used one of the four other options. Frequently they have *then* decided that the plan wouldn't work, but that's exactly the same as the protection you get in Nobilis.<br/><br/>In - say - Wushu, if a player says that something happens, that thing happens and the only thing which can block it is a group veto. In Nobilis you don't have that, what you have is a suggestion to the GM that they shouldn't shoot down a player's ideas without listening to them.<br/><br/>If you want to make a big distinction between rules and GM advice, that's okay, but I don't see it.  GM advice is just soft rules.<br/><br/>And the distinction between "hard" and "soft" rules is really important.<br/><br/>If I'm playing Wushu, and say "I kick the zombie through the wall" and the GM says "you try, but you miss" the GM is explicitly breaking the rules of the game. If I am playing Nobilis and I say "I want to kidnap the duke's sister" and the GM says "the duke doesn't have a sister", the GM is only violating one reading of a single piece of GM advice. That's *really, really different*.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite> The Monarda Law, for example, denies the GM the ability to block a player's narration.</blockquote>That appears to be a surprisingly common misconception, considering that I've been debating against the very same interpretation elsewhere over the last few days...<br/><br/>What the Law in fact does is caution the GM against arbitrarily blocking PC actions when those attempts by all rights should lie within the abilities of the characters, always of course taking into account that there do remain great many things which quite simply <i>cannot</i> be done even with fabled miracles of Aspect. You can always <i>try</i> anything (just as you could in real life), but sometimes that will only leave you looking rather silly: in time anything may indeed become possible, but not necessarily here and now and without outside help.                        </div>

                            First I must say: If the Monarda Law is your only problem with playing Nobilis, you probably are of high Aspect.<br/>

So when you discuss that Law, remember that you're playing Nobilis. Just  as James said.                        </div>

Sorry, but no. You cannot breathe life into an inanimate object through any miracle of Aspect: you could sculpt a statue so lifelike that everyone swears it's about to open its eyes, but you couldn't actually bring it to life. You cannot even heal other <i>living</i> creatures with Aspect, not directly, although you could learn surgery in a matter of moments and then proceed to operate flawlessly on someone's heart. Aspect measures the distance between all the physical, mental and social abilities of a common mortal and those of a miraculous being. It specifically does <i>not</i> cover mystical or magical powers.<br/>
<br/>
But conceivably you might discover the existence of an obscure Rite which allows someone to create such a golem, and there are always other alternatives... Does your creation have to leave the confines of the Chancel? If not, use Realm. Does it absolutely have to be made of clay? If not, use Domain.                        </div>

No. It's not a matter of levels at all. Aspect simply <i>cannot</i> bring something to life, beyond the impossibly effective resuscitation of someone who had just died.                        </div>

Actually, considering the astronomically large number of concepts that must be covered by the rules, I've always felt that the descriptions of the miracle levels were astonishingly complete.  Mind you, sometimes there's a miracle that 'feels like' it should at a different level just as far as usefulness, but it's almost always clear what level the rules say something should be, which forestalls arguments.  And, to drag the conversation back to the supposed topic, Nobilis functions well practically because of rules like this.  The 'did you have fun?  If so, reward yourself' rule is more obviously exploitable, but in the end it's more a guideline than a rule.  I'd agree that it won't solve a dysfunctional group, but at least points people at what a functional group might look like.                        </br></br></div>

Any HG can houserule all she wants, of course, but the limits of Aspect as written are nevertheless established on the pages 85 and 86 of the GWB. As said, creating life from clay doesn't properly fall within those limits, although you could accomplish the same effect through other means. Studying Rites or High Summonings would probably provide a good starting point.                        </div>
