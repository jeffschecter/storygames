I have played the game and Mara is a very unkind job.  She's the antagonist of the story.  Her explicit social role in the game is try to make sure the character's DON'T MOVE ON.  She does not want to be forgotten.  She wants the characters to hold onto that flower forever.<br/><br/>That means the Mara player has to spend the next few hours in a very emotionally cruel place.  That means Mara's player has to establish a zone of trust.  She has to be personally vulnerable FIRST because she's about to spend the next few hours playing with your vulnerabilities.  Sharing her personal grief makes it okay for her to be the antagonist.  She's already been vulnerable for the group, she's earned it.<br/><br/>The Director does not have to participate in the action.  He is not exposed to the same kind of emotional roller coaster the rest of the players are.  However, he HAS been witness to a whole hell of a lot of personal vulnerability.  So he has to share too.  He goes last to say, "Thank You."<br/><br/>It's all about a window of emotional trust.  Mara opens the window because she is present, active and unkind.  The Director closes the window because he observant, thoughtful and thankful.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266991/#Comment_266991" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T16:21:35+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  4:21PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey,<br/><br/>I don't have time to answer this right now, but I will!<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267120/#Comment_267120" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T11:34:54+00:00" title="April 14, 2010 11:34AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, let's get started!<br/><br/>Well, first, let me start with a disclaimer. In many ways, <i>A Flower for Mara</i> has been my most intuitive design, and there are things about it that I decided because they seemed like a good idea at the time without necessarily having the right words for it. Some of these things have been explained to me since publishing the game, and, while I'd love to take credit for consciously designing these features into the game, I can't take the credit. Happy accident or subconscious design? Dunno.<br/><br/>Anyways, the positioning of the Flower Soliloquies for Mara and the Director live in this area.<br/><br/>I started with a basic principle. The "regular" players could choose to give a Flower Soliloquy or not, based on the logic of the fiction and their own desires. However, it didn't seem right that Mara and the Director could somehow dodge giving a Flower Soliloquy just because they weren't playing a regular character. Giving a Flower Soliloquy is an emotionally vulnerable experience, and no one who is a part of the game should have the right to be on the sidelines.<br/><br/>So, the solution seemed simple. Mara and the Director <i>have</i> to give a Flower Soliloquy. It's just required, and that's it.<br/><br/>But where to put them? This actually wasn't a difficult question for me, because of my previous structuring of the game as a loose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiastic_structure" rel="nofollow">chiasm</a>. Organized by parallels, it looks like this:<br/><br/>A. Pregame conversation<br/>\tB. Raising the Curtain<br/>\t\tC. Mara's Flower Soliloquy<br/>\t\t\tD. Play<br/>\t\t\t\tE. Players' Flower Soliloquies<br/>\t\t\tD'. Play<br/>\t\tC'. Director's Flower Soliloquy<br/>\tB'. Lowering the Curtain<br/>A'. Postgame conversation<br/><br/>During design, I don't think I realized the parallel of the pregame and postgame conversations. (In fact, the postgame conversation portion of play was inspired by a conversation that Emily and I had at GenCon 2007 on encouraging postgame reflection.) Also, I'm cheating a little on the DED parallelism. In reality, a player's Flower Soliloquy is embedded in play, which surrounds and cradles the Soliloquy. So, in reality, it's more like DEDEDED, with each step to a Flower Soliloquy being a transition to a deeper place, hidden inside play.<br/><br/>Some of this structure was simply aesthetic. I think that chiastic structure is beautiful. Some of it was consciously pursuing my main design principle: the entire point of <i>A Flower for Mara</i> is the delivery of those Flower Soliloquies. Everything else serves the purpose of providing space and creating context for those short monologues. So, each concentric circle of the chiasm provides another layer of the ritual space which encircles the participants, both shielding them from the "regular" world and also guiding them towards the center of the circle and the experience that awaits them.<br/><br/>And yes, some of that was intentional, and some of that was discovered.<br/><br/>Anyways, the chiastic ordering of the Flower Soliloquies for Mara and the Director made a lot of sense. Originally, though, the Director went first. It seemed right, since he would be the most detached emotionally from player, that he should have to take the first step in being emotionally vulnerable. But it didn't work well. I'd like to say that it's because I picked up on the subtle emotional resonances that Jesse has pointed out, but the biggest reason I remember is that it was just a <i>hassle</i> for Mara to have to carry that stupid flower for the duration of the game. It made it harder for her to do her job. So I swapped the positions, and I liked the feel better.<br/><br/>(Aside: you know that irritating feeling that you get from carrying that flower around? Yeah, I discovered that, too.)<br/><br/>One thing that happened as a result of this switch is that the flow of play during the Raising of the Curtain was improved. Everyone gathers at the gravesite for the reading, and then everyone leaves, except Mara. This experience becomes the leading edge of the fiction. After all, everyone just buried Mara, right? And then they walked away from her. That ritual is the beginning of the players' opportunity to connect with  their characters' experience.<br/><br/>In the same way, at the end, the Director reconvenes the group at the graveside, where we exit this space that we've formed together. It's like the last time that the group gets to touch each other <i>as the group</i>, and so it's appropriate that the Director take the lead in establishing this final moment.<br/><br/>But, again, these were features that I discovered through play, either in playtest or in my experience of the game since it was published.<br/><br/>Does that answer the question?

If you're still carrying the flower, then your character is still carrying his grief. You're not allowed to resolve the character's grief issues without giving a flower soliloquy.<br/><br/>Now, if I were to write a second edition of <i>A Flower for Mara</i> (which isn't likely, by the way), I'd consider including some form of Rule Zero for the Director for the scene structure, letting him make spot decisions on skipping over specific scenes and the like. At the same time, I <i>wonder</i> if people might jump to that option too much because they are trying to resolve the story or suchlike. I'd rather that the players focus on the experience of the character in the situation, living the story from the inside out and relying on the Director to guide the narrative if it becomes necessary.
