I sent the guy a perfectly reasonable PM asking him to reconsider. Naturally I got no response. I imagine this thread will be shut down because of course...reasons.<br/><br/>Why does it have to be this way? Why is every site pertaining to rpg discussion run like this? Can't you people swallow your pride for five minutes and stop stifling productive discussion just because your feelings got hurt or something? This is ridiculous, it's absolutely ridiculous. I'm all for moderation where appropriate but there is something about gamers and moderation that just doens't mix. This needs to change or I'm done. There's no point trying to have a discussion where discussion isn't welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452208/#Comment_452208" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-15T01:45:55+00:00" title="April 15, 2016  1:45AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I asked you to redirect away from that topic or move on, and if you had issues, to take it up with me in PM. You did none of those things while the thread was open.<br/><br/>It's been articulated before that this isn't the place for "x site is being terrible" especially when x is another forum site (but I fully admit, I should have not assumed that was present in people's minds, and reiterated it as soon as I entered the thread). That therpgsite has a lot of interesting opinions about Story Games is not more than a trivial factor here. <br/><br/>After the discussion was closed, you sent me a two-sentence message saying to stop this 'petulance' and to reopen the discussion. There was no indication that reopening wouldn't lead back to exactly where you were keeping it.<br/><br/>The history of harassment in games, digital and tabletop, online and offline is a complex, lengthy, important topic. There's a lot of examination that each and every one of us can do in our local communities to figure out how to deal with broken stairs, how to make our communities better. <br/><br/>There's also a lot of places that spend time discussing and arguing over which sites and people are spreading ideas that we do/don't like, and who's worthy of being called out.<br/><br/>This isn't that place.<br/><br/>Have a temporary ban to cool down. If that's the last straw, then no problem, I hope you find some place that suits what you're looking for. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
