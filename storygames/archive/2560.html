But I hope Clinton will respond, as it's his game (and I hope he doesn't mind me inviting discussion of it while it's still in development).<br/><br/>I was just re-reading the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1199" rel="nofollow">Big Gencon stakes discussion</a> and it occurred to me that the Face of Angels conflict rules has some interesting bearing on this issue.  I don't think the FOA rules in any way invalidate Ron's point, but they put a potentialy new spin on the "stakes" issue.<br/><br/>Here's the relevant conflict section from the FOA wiki (hope this is kosher, Clinton):\n<blockquote> Contests are always between two players, and characters they control. A contest happens when one player says that a character they control is going to do something and another player thinks that shouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t happen, at least not without some opposition. Others can jump in and help one side or the other, but the contest is specifically between those two players. The person that wants to make the contested action is the initiator and the person who is providing the opposition is the respondent. In play, often someone will anticipate opposition and state they want a contest, but someone still has to step up and give that opposition.<br/><br/>The initiator is required to set stakes - that is, they say what they want to happen if they win the contest (in this case, played with cards) and what they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re willing to have happen if they lose. These stakes must follow the guidelines for stakes for that act.<br/><br/>The respondent has to decide whether those stakes are OK. If so, the respondent accepts and then states the pace: that is, are they playing cards for one, two, or three tricks? If not, though, the respondent can change either the condition if the initiator wins or the condition if the initiator loses, but not both. The respondent states the new condition, and this is bounced back over to the initiator. The initiator gets the same choice: change the winning condition, change the losing condition, or accept the conditions and set the pace.<br/></blockquote>\nMy reading of this (which may be flawed) is that the rules setup a process for two players to engage in the activity Ron describes as "chesting" (in the Big Gencon stakes discussion), but in a potentially positive way.  There is plenty of room for players to negotiate the stakes and mutually escalate or de-escalate them to a level acceptable to them both.<br/><br/><br/>My questions are:<br/><br/>Do the rules address the issue Ron identified, even though they include stakes (not just intent)?  Or do they need to be changed to avoid the "poison" of stakes (e.g. pre-narrated outcomes not emerging from the resolution system)?<br/><br/>If the rules are changed to deal with intent, rather than stakes, does the inter-player negotiation lose a lot of it's energy?  It seems to me that negotiating intent is a lot less interesting than negotiating outcomes.<br/><br/>What's your take?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58856/#Comment_58856" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-03T07:25:57+00:00" title="March  3, 2007  7:25AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Adam,<br/><br/>My answers will be obviously biased.<br/><br/>Those rules were written before Ron's discussion, and while I found that discussion to have a lot of merit, I don't think about how to fit a game into the Current Official Guidelines when writing it. (I'm being sarcastic, but not really mean-spirited there.)<br/><br/>Anyway, I did think about that discussion in revision. I think the FoA system works around the "stakes problem," which is, succinctly, that we think too much about the end of the contest before we have the contest. I still do that, but intentionally instead of implicitly. I'm setting up a betting system - looking at your cards in FoA, you'll know how to maximize your chances of success, by playing for one, two, or three tricks. But you lose the ability to determine number of tricks by changing the stakes. So you have to decide whether to accept certain consequences and maximize your chances of success, or change the consequences and possibly set yourself up for failure.<br/><br/>In play, it worked pretty well, but I intend to playtest it some more before publication.<br/><br/>To answer the end of your post, negotiating about intent sounds really not fun to me: I know my character's intent. I'm worried about the outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58868/#Comment_58868" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-03T10:26:08+00:00" title="March  3, 2007 10:26AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clinton,<br/><br/>I have to say I really like FoA in its current form, so I'm glad to hear you're not changing the stakes negotiation.  I think it's a real strength in combination with the game's theme, which I see as being how the character's powers and decisions impact first their own lives and the lives of those around them (in the early acts) and then the world itself (in later acts).  Without the ability to specify at least some of the outcomes prior to starting the contest, nailing down this impact would be a lot harder.<br/><br/>Good luck with your playtest.  I'll definitely be buying FoA when you publish it.  And I'm planning on stealing your negotiation process for something I'm working on now.
