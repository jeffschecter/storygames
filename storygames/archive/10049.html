I said "mine disaster" and it eventually became an antarctic team drilling for ice core samples, stumbling upon Nazi tunnels from the 1930s.  Basically, a lot like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8M59Npkh8w" rel="nofollow">the trailer for Whiteout</a>, which I stumbled on last night. We're having a lot of fun drawing ice tunnels deeper and deeper into the ground. Near the end of the session, I drew the inevitable submarine dock, deep below where the tunnels meet the ocean. The characters are being possessed by ghostly echos of the past, killing each other with ice picks and such.  Fun.<br/><br/>Yesterday, Wednesday, I played Primetime Adventures in Chinese with Alexis and Bohan.  Our show was called "Someday Station" in English and "\u53c8\u4e00\u5929\u592a\u7a7a\u7ad9" in Chinese. Alexis produced, Bohan was the corrupt alien cop Alabuda, and I was the human mob boss Liu Xiaohan. My teenage niece and his adopted human son were spotted coming out of a movie theatre together, so I had my lieutenant rough the son up a bit. This led to chaos and eventually my niece ran off with the kid and eloped, so the episode ended with Alabuda and Liu Xiaohan getting drunk together, bemoaning the fact that they were now related.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223069/#Comment_223069" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-06T14:51:53+00:00" title="August  6, 2009  2:51PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2009 2:53PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In last night's game of Dogs in the Vineyard, Malcolm Craig and Simon C had a really nice raise-see exchange.

We've got a whole thing going on with a series of space stations in the Casiguran Matriarchy that have been taken over by a revolutionary but repressive and paranoid workers' Commune, but the core of the game has to do with a pretty tangled omnisexual love triangle (love hexagon?) among most of the main characters.  <br/><br/>We avoided Duel of Wits and Firefight for the first session, since two of the players are either entirely or mostly new to the system, and I'm rusty, and it turned out (IMHO) to be a really good idea.  It felt like we got to stretch our legs a bit without any huge conflicts, and we had really cool scenes that might have gotten lost in the build-up to a complex conflict scene, like Rachael's Hammer Captain sharing some memories with Rachel's Psychologist about their parents, and one of my FoN's watching his son sleep while clutching a plush Hammer toy (just like Mom's!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223230/#Comment_223230" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T11:36:43+00:00" title="August  7, 2009 11:36AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2009 11:36AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a moment in Mouse Guard.

Meanwhile the Tsarina is following the tracks of bandits who attacked their herd and encounters some advancing riders. Anna, player of the Jarl, asks "Oh, is that me?" - "Sure!". So they start arguing about the land and eventually get in a fight in which the Tsarina dominates the Jarl. On the edge of the scene Oghma is writing furiously. After the jarl escapes Tsarina asks Oghma whether he knew who crossed this land recently. <br/>\nAnd we cut several hours back to Oghma being attacked by a warlock and his lackeys. Oghma saves his hide by confronting the warlock with unspeakables truths. <br/>\nBack to the interrogation scene between Oghma and the Tsarina in which he states what he knows.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis flow was really organic and super fun.

I think this is a mixture of:<br/><br/>1) Lack of sleep: I was awake from 5:30 AM, worked a brutal and distracting day right up until gaming, then ran.<br/>2) Lack of prep: I've gotten by before, but I think this last session was to my detriment.<br/><br/>The lesson I learned was that in small conflict-centric or explosive games like TBZ and other games with *very* aggressive scene-framing, lack of prep can really derail things. I noticed that when I had lack of prep in other games, like L5R or Savage Worlds, I could often stall for time by having "tavern talk" or a quick combat. In aggressive scene-framing games, you have to be on the ball or you might as well pack it in. It was a lesson learned. <br/><br/>Luckily, my work schedule changed so I won't be pulling any more insane no-sleep work-then-gaming runs for a long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223718/#Comment_223718" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T13:55:29+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  1:55PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played a Burning Wheel: Warhammer Fantasy game Thursday - The Inglorious Tales of the Sewerjacks (Sewerjacks being the poor guardsmen who patrol the sewers).

When the danger passed I murdered all the babies and got out of there.  So in the big throw down, I described the weasel captain as menacing Abel, and Otis gets his attention and pulls the mutilated remains of one of his weasel children out of his ruck.  Weasel goes mad with rage, charges me, and gives Abel a glorious free shot that takes him down.

Who was here with his uncle, the emperor.<br/><br/>I had been at a loss as to how to bring *my* Dark Fate into the game in any sort of elegant way. My "Why is your dude a ronin?" shtick was that my master tried to kill the emperor and was killed, and I secretly agreed with his actions. So I wanted to have my Dark Fate revolve around the emperor and my master's failure to bring him down. And here he was! Perfect!<br/><br/>Plus, as we passed into the spirit world, Tim narrated that the broken sword of my dead master (which of course my character totes around, to make himself feel bad) was whole again. Clearly a sign, Is my master alive in this realm? Or is his spirit telling me to finish what he started?<br/><br/>So ... where I was once at a loss regarding my Dark Fate, I now have all kinds of ways to go, thanks to my fellow players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224407/#Comment_224407" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T22:21:11+00:00" title="August 12, 2009 10:21PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I starting playing "My Uncle the Baron" with my 10-year-old niece.

It's kind of a loosely coupled community and the lack of facial clues can make roleplaying tougher.<br/><br/>This session, one guy was playing Richard von Frankenstein, a revenant artificer. Revenant means just what you think it might mean. Undead, unclean! Artificer means, more or less, magical engineering type. Part of the artificer schtick in 4e is that you make little healing powder/elixir/poultice thingies during the course of the adventure and hand 'em out during combats.<br/><br/>So about halfway through I twig to what he's doing: his story is that he removes little bits and pieces of himself, which are charged with necrotic lifeforce, and distills those into his healing elixirs. When he's healing the party, he's feeding them his own flesh and blood. The player was marvelously understated about it, and it was tremendously fun to watch.<br/><br/>Sometimes you get crappy LFR tables, and sometimes you get little nuggets of brilliance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225351/#Comment_225351" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T07:49:00+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  7:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2009 7:49AM by anansigirl.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Warhammer: Just after we thought we'd escaped chaos from the depths of the chaos dwarf mountains, we find it in the most unlikely of places: a nice nurse at a fort our travel weary mercenary company is charged to defend gave birth to a horrid creature whose only crime was being born evil. We killed the horrid creature, burned the mother as a witch, and the father committed suicide.

The space station is a pleasure station, where a mix of local races go on vacation. But something is amiss, the alien classes are not evenly divided, there's scientists aboard doing strange experiments on an unknown crystaline rock, and a strange vessel is being kept hostage in one of the docking bays! What will become of our heroes after the Zenetan pirates catch up with them on the station? Tune in next time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226095/#Comment_226095" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T23:20:22+00:00" title="August 19, 2009 11:20PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Happy Birthday, Robot: I wrote up a fairly detailed AP in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=226094" rel="nofollow">thread where the game was released</a>.

Our game started out slowly, and (using a technique we've come to love) I decided to fast-forward a bit in my second scene, to a point after the fiasco has gotten underway. The setup: My character has a replica Star Trek bridge chair that John's character wants like nothing else in the world. My character won't sell it to him, though, partly because he harbors a dream of selling it to William Shatner, who is said to collect them, for an exorbitant sum, and partly out of spite.  His character schemes with Kathy's character, a thief named Brenda, to somehow extract it from my guy's possession ("I don't want to know how"). She talks my guy, Courtney, into taking it to a major Trek convention in San Diego to sell it when the Shatner thing falls through, which will put it outside of Courtney's vault.  I skip over the convention and establish a scene where I'm menacing John's guy, Luke, with a gun, since I know he's stolen the chair - he either needs to give the chair back, or give Courtney the $100K that Shatner was "going to pay me." So, I'm already lying.  Two scenes later, someone suggested that maybe <i>everything about that scene</i>, from my character's perspective, was a lie. So in that scene, Courtney and Brenda are at the convention, when Courtney proposes that they should both sell the chair, and then shake down Courtney's geek cousin Luke too, by accusing him of stealing it.<br/><br/>The group built on this by setting many of the succeeding scenes <i>before</i> the main fiasco happened, revealing that the events we knew had to happen, in the future, were all part of a larger con.  Detailed AP will be forthcoming. The interesting lesson, for now, is that by doing a flashforward early in the game, then revealing that someone was lying in that scene, then revealing that someone else was conning the liar in the scene where the original lie was revealed, you can achieve this kind of heist-movie story with Fiasco, and it's totally awesome. We kept surprising ourselves by finding new ways to recast the meaning of previous scenes, and captured the feel of something like <i>Lucky Number Slevin</i> perfectly, with fake double-crosses that, we discovered, were pursued in the service of the master quadruple cross - one that we only realized had to have happened as we narrated the penultimate scene.<br/><br/>The best part? We had no idea what was going to happen until it did. Every betrayal and lie and hidden plan was a delightful surprise to all of us; we really were composing at the keyboard, in the best way, and the system pushed us there. I love this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226113/#Comment_226113" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T04:31:42+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  4:31AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>someone suggested that maybe<i>everything about that scene</i>, from my character's perspective, was a lie.</blockquote>\nThat is fantastic.
