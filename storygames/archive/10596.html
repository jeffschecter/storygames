I've now read it pretty thoroughly (I need to do it again, some of the subsystems need a second read-through).  The greatness of this game cannot be appreciated in a brief glance-through.<br/><br/>The number of previously impossible or unadvisable things that this game pulls off is amazing.  Here are some thoughts of mine.<br/><br/>* The three-phase setup for worm takeover of a planet is great.  Although I do have a question.  The description of each of the phases says that Infiltration happens first, if it's successful enough, Usurpation happens but if it's not, Invasion happens.  Nevertheless, in the game structure diagram it indicates that the campaign has three phases. Does that mean all three of the phases happen in every game, or if we kick the worm's ass in Infiltration enough, can we force them to skip straight to Invasion, as Usurpation wouldn't work?<br/><br/>This is an interesting question to me as it's quite possible to come out of the World Burner with a world that's resistant to infiltration and invasion but vulnerable to usurpation, and strategically it would make sense to make every effort to avoid that second phase if it could be done.<br/><br/>I also think that this phase system (whether it is branched or linear) can be used in all sorts of situations.  Figure out the bad guy's plans, and what sorts of things they're up to, subdivide them, then start working on a Burner that will create different environments for those plans.  My Forgotten Realms work would be greatly assisted by this.  So would all those "collect the plot token" games out there. The cool thing in those situations is never the tokens, it's the bad guy and the environment which he and the players must contend with.  Burning Rod Of Seven Parts anyone?<br/><br/>* The "you must identify an objective other than survival or killing in a fight" rule is devastatingly concise and useful in all sorts of contexts.  What I like about it, and the rest of the fightin' system, is that it still permits (and in some cases even encourages) winning by routing the other fellow.  Unlike a lot of systems that try to impose other objectives on combat through mechanics, an enemy soldier is still an enemy soldier, not just a narrative obstacle.  That is fucking great.<br/><br/>* You must have a connection to someone "on the other side". HAHAHA. That is hilarious and wonderful.<br/><br/>More thoughts on this as they develop, this really is a terrific game all the way around.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timeLESS" title="timeLESS"><img alt="timeLESS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i253.photobucket.com/albums/hh79/gamestribe/cthulhumobster.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timeLESS">timeLESS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235038/#Comment_235038" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T11:29:36+00:00" title="October  1, 2009 11:29AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just got a copy of Burning Empires as well and think its a beautiful book and looks like a TON of fun! <br/>it looks so good in fact it had me getting the iron empires comics as well ! which now that you have mentioned it, im going to read right NOW ! <br/><br/>ps.

Look instead at what happened at the table (who was the important player? who helped whom?).<br/><br/>p.<br/><i>is dangerously close to geeking right the hell out of his skull on Burning Empires talk, right here in front of everyone.</i></blockquote>\nI have not read it in awhile so I could be mistaken, but I thought it explicitly stated to pick a Maneuver and use that as a springboard for the fiction.  It even gives you examples in the Maneuver descriptions and talks about generating downtime by "Going to Ground".  <br/><br/>It also mentions that once a Maneuver has been played through you pick a skill from the list which reflects what you did in play and roll it for your Infection roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235113/#Comment_235113" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T15:05:02+00:00" title="October  1, 2009  3:05PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Springboard for the fiction" is the important part: Your Maneuver choice drives the fiction, but the fiction does not drive the Maneuver roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235117/#Comment_235117" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T15:28:36+00:00" title="October  1, 2009  3:28PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I'm thinking a breakdown of how Infection actually works would be helpful.<br/><br/>1) Players pick a Maneuver. This is usually driven by the desire to hit the other side's disposition, but sometimes it isn't. Like, you can't attack the other side 'til you've performed an Assess, for example. Or you really want to earn up some downtime and get some close skills to go ahead and pop. But setting those aside, assuming the players have a full range of maneuvers to pick from, we take two things into consideration:<br/><br/>* Who has lots of Artha RIGHT NOW? Because this maneuver's artha doesn't get rewarded 'til after the maneuver<br/><br/>* Whose Belief(s) and/or "when last seen" is going to be easiest to engage in a way that feeds back into the skills available for the Maneuver you're considering? IOW who is going to be making the FON roll? Who is on deck? <br/><br/>The GM's choice is a bit easier, and IME typically comes down to who has the most Artha headed into the maneuver.<br/><br/>2) Players do the stuff they need to do within their scenes to feed dice to the on-deck Figure of Note's player. That is, provide help, linked or connection dice to him from the maneuver's skill list. Meanwhile, the on-deck guy is working at making sure he actually IS the "most important character", probably by instigating a conflict. Players who are NOT the FON chase the living shit out of standard Artha-generating BW play, so they're ready to go to bat on a future Maneuver roll.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the GM is doing the stuff HE needs to do within his scenes to feed dice to his own on-deck FON. This one's easier: just get the FON's all involved in scenes. Usually easy, sometimes not. THe GM also can fuck around with the players' plans, typically by directing narrative attention *away* from the guy angling to make the Maneuver roll. <br/><br/>The players then have to balance several things at once:<br/><br/>* Earning Artha for themselves<br/>* Keeping the on-deck FON on-deck, i.e. not spotlight-whoring<br/>* Making sure they're doing what they can to feed the on-deck FON dice (i.e. helping within the chosen maneuver's skill list)<br/><br/>3) When the scenes are over and everyone's out, reveal maneuvers, determine the suitable skill, gather dice, and spend Artha. Now if the players are doing it right, the "suitable skill" will have been aimed at by the FON on deck all session long. You KNEW you were going for an Assess, so by GOD you have better been doing Assess-y things.<br/><br/>But that part, right there, is where things slip sideways for a lot of players. They look at the maneuver only after the fact and ask "huh...well, I made an Investigative Logic roll...I <i>guess</i> that means I should be making that Assess roll..." And guess what? In most cases, they weren't really aiming to make that roll. So it's no wonder they can't link the maneuver's fiction to the maneuver's outcome. <br/><br/>4) Play out the sequel. This is really the only point in the transaction where they kind of prompt you to tie the Maneuver's fiction into the larger Infection. But that's way, way after the fact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235119/#Comment_235119" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T15:40:40+00:00" title="October  1, 2009  3:40PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, yes, yes, YES!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235124/#Comment_235124" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T16:01:23+00:00" title="October  1, 2009  4:01PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it does require some looking-ahead.

Page 401 says this:<br/><br/><i>If the Vaylen win the infiltration phase, they manage to infect<br/>the planet and set up a method of bringing more of their kind<br/>onto the world. If the human side wins, they manage to thwart<br/>the Vaylen infiltration and prevent them from establishing a foothold<br/>on this world. This phase is a very crucial stage for the human side! If<br/>the Vaylen lose, they may opt to prematurely invade, or they may<br/>abandon their designs on the planet altogether.</i><br/><br/>Now, the Usurpation and Invasion descriptions include similar language but IMO it's all color. The bit that jumps out at me is "...they may opt to prematurely invade, or they may abandon their designs on the planet altogether." Who's "they" in this case? Well, BW doctrine says there are no characters, only players. So it's the Vaylen's player(s) who -- if they lose the Infiltration and are faced with a tough Usurpation, with the humans plowing half their surviving dispo into it -- decide whether to skip Usurpation and just hit with an Invasion, or pull the plug on the campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235188/#Comment_235188" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T07:16:15+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  7:16AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul's got it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235190/#Comment_235190" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T07:37:18+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  7:37AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2009 7:37AM by JDCorley.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense.

Do you really need to play the Usurpation phase? Nah, you can go straight to Invasion, without collecting your $200.<br/><br/>And these, of course, are the two different types of invasion described in the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235214/#Comment_235214" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T09:44:23+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  9:44AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, interesting thoughts there. So really it could be a two-phase game instead of three, under many circumstances. That's what I thought, but the diagram of the game structure threw me off a bit. <br/><br/>I have a bit of an idea for a rules extension for "minor" factions, those that are not "players" on their own, but who could be swayed to support one of the real deal factions with a mechanical benefit. When I get it together I'll post it up.<br/><br/>So here is another thought, this one about the World Burner (and Character Burner too I guess).  It seems like that even without the worm knocking on the door, the worlds and characters created are right on the verge of tipping over.  The center cannot hold, the situation is untenable, the characters have strong drives to change things.  However, many many settings (superheros, fantasy, etc.) often have a defensible and stable status quo that persists until enemy action destabilizes it.   Is there any reason that the World Burner/Character Burner doesn't work as well in, say, Canada, the Forgotten Realms or the Legion of Superheroes' 30th Century?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235217/#Comment_235217" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T10:04:15+00:00" title="October  2, 2009 10:04AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2009 10:12AM by Daniel H..">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>However, many many settings (superheros, fantasy, etc.) often have a defensible and stable status quo that persists until enemy action destabilizes it.

It's a game that's meant to be played, to be interacted with.  Which is maybe ironic seeing as it's based on a licensed property, but Luke and Co. give you all the tools to make your game whatever you want it to be.  There's, like, eight pages of dedicated setting material.  Everything else is conveyed through the game mechanics.

I think the reason is to have feasible heroes who defend the status quo.  They are conservative tales.  (You may be right about marketing, but I know nothing about that field, possessing both a soul and a mind of modest discernment.)  Unless the status quo is "worth defending", you can't really identify with or sympathize with the guy who wants to defend it.

The main conflict can throw the character's world into chaos and turmoil, but the key point is that without that conflict things would not explode into a billion pieces, things would get along okay. <br/><br/>I mean, Metropolis is a city, and it has city problems, but the real issue is that Lex Luthor is going to blow it up with a death laser unless someone does something about it.<br/><br/>What I am after is using the game structure of BE (including maneuvers, etc.) to handle stories of this more conservative kind, as I listed before.  <br/><br/>I like the Beliefs idea, that actually makes me think of belief traits from With Great Power.

I feel that way sometimes too. But there are other times when someone says "LOOK OUT, HERE COMES THE CONFLICT" and I go "what, oh, uh, whatever, I never really gave a damn about the way things were..." (or worse, "thank goodness, the way things were was terrible!") "...so I don't really care about what happens next, good luck with that, oh, it's my turn, I guess my guy would do this."  There are some others in my group that feel this way too. I can easily see us coming to the end of the World and Character Burner without really caring too much about whether any particular character gets what they want, which would reduce the fun in finding out whether they do.  They have to get a grip on how things are for characters before they are able to decide what to feel and do about a change in the situation.<br/><br/>Edit: Oh, wait!! Okay, I see something here. I've basically just listed why conservative story structures of the kind I listed above are ideal for design-in-play folks like my group.  You know what might be cool, is using the Character Burner lifepath decisions to play out certain "before the start" activities, so they can get a better emotional grip on what they're about, and then be able to jump right in at the first phase section.<br/><br/>Double edit: I don't think you missed the point, I think I got what you meant.

By utopia I meant the kind of setting you describe. I'm cynical like that.<br><br>If you want more reactive style play out of a World Burner/Infection mechanic, focus on these areas:<br/><br/><b>Figures of Note:</b> If the GM FoNs aren't external baddies or are also enemies of the Vaylen, that means their agendas are wrong, ie they allow the Vaylen to invade. If the Forged Lord is an implacable enemy of the Vaylen but is also a GM FoN, the PCs have to fight against him to stop him from inadvertently allowing the Vaylen to win. That means internal conflict. So, remove that.<br/><br/><b>Relationships with the other side:</b> Same thing, really. This is to emphasize the insidious nature of the Vaylen, and how they take over your friends and family and you never know until it's too late. It also works to emphasize how decisions as to the fate of the planet will be hashed out by people who know each other. So, remove that too, or y'know, use it like Superman has a relationship with Lexx Luthor, 'cause they already know each other. Whatever.<br/><br/><b>Beliefs:</b> An effective Belief basically states a problem and proposes a solution. "I must be the next Forged Lord, not my brother! I will gain the support of the church." Beliefs that challenge the status quo get you Artha, defensive Beliefs are defective. So, you could remove Beliefs. Or, you could be up-front about the threat, and have players write Beliefs focused on it, or perhaps on their own personal lives instead of on social issues. "Lexx Luthor must be locked up, I will discover his secret headquarters!" or "I want Gwen Stacy to go steady with me," but not "The mayor is a fool, I will replace him with a robotic double!"<br/><br/><b>Factions:</b> These don't actually come into play until somebody goes after them. Having an Organized Crime faction is an opportunity: if you go after it, you can get the Disposition bonus, but if nobody brings it up, criminals don't become a threat in the game. You don't have to have any factions, in which case nobody will get "sidetracked" by them, and you can concentrate on threat vs society.<br/><br/>The framework of creating a world and then using Disposition and Maneuvers to threaten it doesn't inherently create a setting in conflict with itself. Even ignoring all this stuff I just wrote, you can still make the kind of setting you're describing.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235286/#Comment_235286" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T15:25:11+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  3:25PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the tips, they help. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Sorry, poor choice of wording.

Hard-fought battle, sacrifices, yadda yadda, they win.<br/><br/>BE <i>does</i> says humanity is doomed, there are just too many Vaylen and humanity as a whole won't work together. But the World Burner gives humans a pretty fair chance of victory, I'd say. If you make some ignorant sub-index sea-world, you'll get pwned and hulled, but your average world is no easy target. Then again, there's no setup for taking worlds back from the Vaylen either.<br/><br/>So, no, I don't think it's very cynical. A bit dark, and it doesn't idealize politics, for sure. But I also acknowledge being hella cynical myself, right... somebody else might find BE crushingly, depressingly, hopelessly cynical.

Maybe this could be the subject of a new thread someday.<br/><br/>My own take on BE is that it is fairly neutral.  In fact it has probably one of the better "it is better to turn an enemy or rival to your side than to kill them or defeat them" mechanics out there.

I've now read it pretty thoroughly (I need to do it again, some of the subsystems need a second read-through).  The greatness of this game cannot be appreciated in a brief glance-through.<br/><br/>The number of previously impossible or unadvisable things that this game pulls off is amazing.  Here are some thoughts of mine.<br/><br/>* The three-phase setup for worm takeover of a planet is great.  Although I do have a question.  The description of each of the phases says that Infiltration happens first, if it's successful enough, Usurpation happens but if it's not, Invasion happens.  Nevertheless, in the game structure diagram it indicates that the campaign has three phases. Does that mean all three of the phases happen in every game, or if we kick the worm's ass in Infiltration enough, can we force them to skip straight to Invasion, as Usurpation wouldn't work?<br/><br/>This is an interesting question to me as it's quite possible to come out of the World Burner with a world that's resistant to infiltration and invasion but vulnerable to usurpation, and strategically it would make sense to make every effort to avoid that second phase if it could be done.<br/><br/>I also think that this phase system (whether it is branched or linear) can be used in all sorts of situations.  Figure out the bad guy's plans, and what sorts of things they're up to, subdivide them, then start working on a Burner that will create different environments for those plans.  My Forgotten Realms work would be greatly assisted by this.  So would all those "collect the plot token" games out there. The cool thing in those situations is never the tokens, it's the bad guy and the environment which he and the players must contend with.  Burning Rod Of Seven Parts anyone?<br/><br/>* The "you must identify an objective other than survival or killing in a fight" rule is devastatingly concise and useful in all sorts of contexts.  What I like about it, and the rest of the fightin' system, is that it still permits (and in some cases even encourages) winning by routing the other fellow.  Unlike a lot of systems that try to impose other objectives on combat through mechanics, an enemy soldier is still an enemy soldier, not just a narrative obstacle.  That is fucking great.<br/><br/>* You must have a connection to someone "on the other side". HAHAHA. That is hilarious and wonderful.<br/><br/>More thoughts on this as they develop, this really is a terrific game all the way around.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235337/#Comment_235337" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-03T00:30:53+00:00" title="October  3, 2009 12:30AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kinda felt like I got my money's worth and improved my gaming just by reading the Duel of Wits and Firefight sections, sooo. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Anyway, cool thread peeps.

Were you and the other players writing Beliefs about what interested you and pursuing those Beliefs?<br/><br/>Yes, we're BW veterans and had some excellent BITs.  What would happen though is that something would happen in the session that we would want to explore further but couldn't due to having to play certain scenes with the FoN using the correct actions so that we could roll a skill roll that was advantageous.  <br/><br/>So if Jimmy discovers something really messed up going on in the Church and he wants to go mess up an NPC for killing his buddy earlier we have to put this on hold because we've only had 1 Assess-like scene.  We chose Assess as our maneuever though so can't spend 3/4ths of the Maneuver ambushing enemy NPCs and spilling blood and then roll Observe on the Infection roll.  Because you are looking ahead and attempting to guide the fiction towards what you'd like to do for the Infection roll - it limits the spontanaiety.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235417/#Comment_235417" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-03T16:19:01+00:00" title="October  3, 2009  4:19PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2009 4:19PM by Luke_Wheel.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is hard to explain.

The game nudges, needles and kicks you into being a selfish asshole. But you can choose to sacrifice yourself and fight the bigger, harder fight -- ignoring your personal agenda in favor of the big picture.<br/><br/>You can say, "FUCK THE ASSESS!" and go tearing after your Beliefs. You just don't help the Assess. You've put your own personal agenda ahead of the world. Or you can grit your teeth and say, "There's no time to fuck around. We've got to pull together." and focus on what the world needs.

It's an inevitable "emergent property" of playing BE, but when it emerges it brings a bunch of tension with it. The players don't know where that tension is coming from and -- at least in my groups' early experiences -- got so flummoxed and frustrated that it interfered with their enjoyment of it. They had come into BE as if it were played like the Descent boardgame (three heroes, closely coordinated actions to fit their team goal, and no meaningful personal goals), when in fact it plays more like ... I don't know, maybe oldskool Republic of Rome (everyone's chasing their own victory but there's a looming "everyone loses" condition they have to deal with along the way).<br/><br/>So we're starting a BE campaign of our own here in sunny Tempe: Invasion phase, balls-out sprint through the whole Phase in hopefully 6 weeks. This is after a couple years of really strong BW play, so consequently the players are much more in a BW head than a "gee I've been playing D&amp;D/Exalted/Vampire all these years, why is BE so broken?" head. They've come up with these outrageously nasty beliefs aimed at EACH OTHER. The rebel leader wants to take down the imperial stewardship, the imperial steward wants to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">manipulate</span> recruit the Forged Lord into helping crush the rebellion, and the Forged Lord wants to nuke his own planet just so the Vaylen can't get it.<br/><br/>I'm so excited to see these Beliefs vis a vis the Infection mechanics that I pee a little just thinking about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235493/#Comment_235493" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-04T08:40:52+00:00" title="October  4, 2009  8:40AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Charles, do you mean you felt restricted because you were playing to the Maneuver, or that there were directions you wanted to take the story in, and stuff you wanted to explore, that you couldn't get to because you had a limited number of scenes to work with?</blockquote>\nBecause of the manuever, not the scenes.

(see page 404). That's all they have to do.  Keeping the Usurpation Phase Figure of note alive is a good idea during the Infiltration, but after the beginning of the Usurpation Phase Prequel (Page 405) after the FON makes the roll to add to disposition, he or she or ... giant frog thing is just the same as everything else.<br/><br/>Maneuver rolls are made by "The player whose character played the most prominent role in the preceding scenes.." (Page 430). The GM side "tests for the figure of note whose presence or machinations factored most heavily into these scenes" (again Page 430).  <br/><br/>Therefore any player may roll for maneuver. The GM is limited to his figure of Note characters, but he can choose whichever one he used a lot in the maneuver.<br/><br/>And therefore Figure of Note isn't a big deal.  Players can be one or not, and still affect each maneuver roll via making the roll, or helping with the roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack" title="Jon Slack"><img alt="Jon Slack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/512/nUS4FIM85ZXII.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack">Jon Slack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241004/#Comment_241004" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-08T18:19:27+00:00" title="November  8, 2009  6:19PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>What possible motivation could a player bring to declining an available FON role?<br/><br/>This comes up every once in a while and I can't figure out the thinking behind it.<br/><br/>To drive this point all the way home, I would:<br/><br/>a) not allow ANY player to roll in a dispo bonus for a Phase that doesn't have a featured FON.<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>b) Punish the players at every opportunity by playing the human-side FON they declined to take responsibility for as if (s)he were a Vaylen loyalist.<br/><br/>What's your thinking on your players' motivation to decline a FON role when it's available? Do they know what the game is about? <br/></blockquote>\nFor one, it's recommended in the World Burning that you have 3 figures of note per side. Now, there is a requirement that <b>one</b> player has to be a Figure of note (Page 67).  The other two Figures of Note can be NPCs (Page 67 spells this out).  <br/><br/>The Figure of Note WILL make the Prequel roll, whether they are a Player or NPC, unless the GM has killed them/Hulled them in play or taken them out as a PHASE goal. And they have to win the phase to achieve their goal. (Page 406)<br/><br/>And the GM cannot kill the Figure of Note unless he makes some successful building rolls to do so.  Most of these will likely be verses tests as the players work to stop whatever awful fate the GM has planned.<br/><br/>Therefore you can play the Bodyguard of the NPC Figure of Note King, keeping him alive and fight hard to convince him not to dine with the mysterious Lady Wyrminherbrain. I agree with Mr. Corley, it is a lot of fun to play that ancillary role. And in BE it is very possible to do this.<br/><br/>The NPC Figure of note is created as a relationship, and as noted in page 65-66, they are "Acting in the best interest of the planet".  So any kind of "punishment" involving the whole Vaylen Loyalist thing is not possible unless the GM succeeds in making their building rolls to convince the Figure of Note.  <br/><br/>In fact, the Infiltration Figure of Note always gets to make their roll, as the Prequel happens before playing the first maneuver of the phase begins. (Page 405)  Let the GM do it's worst to the Infiltration Figure of note, they've done their job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241009/#Comment_241009" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-08T19:59:52+00:00" title="November  8, 2009  7:59PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!

They do not! In fact, the players earn dice based on table behaviors, not in-the-fiction stuff. It's weird and wacky and tripped us up for at least two games.<br/><br/>So, basically, disregard what happened in the fiction. Look instead at what happened at the table (who was the important player? who helped whom?).<br/></blockquote>\nWhen I was playing a lot of Burning Empires, before we chose our Maneuver, we'd sit down and make a list of all our goals. <br/><br/>The goals might be things like:<br/>* Investigate the source of the narcotics spreading in the Red District.<br/>* Trace the paper trail on the Church Operation.<br/>* Disappear Ortiz.<br/>* Get my new factory up and running.<br/>* Get General Leaf released from prison.<br/>* etc.<br/><br/>Everyone got to add their goals to the list. Some might have been on the list for a few sessions, and some might be new. As a group, we'd select a handful of goals (usually two) to pursue for that maneuver. Then we'd ask ourselves which maneuver best fit the goals we'd selected. That would be the maneuver we'd go with. (And if the group didn't agree to pursue a goal that was very important to a particular player, that player could still choose to pursue that goal during the maneuver rather than helping the rest of the group).<br/><br/>And occasionally, we'd choose a maneuver and then select goals that fit that maneuver.<br/><br/>Either way, that little ritual meant that our actions in the game would always mesh with the maneuver we'd selected. We knew that our Conflict Scene had to relate to one of those goals. It also meant that everyone took a moment to really think about what their personal goals were for the maneuver so that they really knew what they wanted out of their Color, Interstitial and Building Scenes.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I think that was a big reason we were able to blaze through two maneuvers each four-hour session we played. <br/>1. We were all very focused and there was very little game downtime as players figured out what they wanted to do next.<br/>2. We didn't try to squeeze too much into a single maneuver. We were very comfortable deciding that a particular set of goals could wait until the next maneuver.<br/><br/>Incidentally, this process helped in another way as well. By staying cognizant of our goals, any Color or Interstitial Scenes that we didn't require for the present maneuver could be used to set up for future goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10596/burning-empires-is-great" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10596/burning-empires-is-great" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10596/burning-empires-is-great/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F10596%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F10596%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
