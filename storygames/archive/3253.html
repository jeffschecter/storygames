Next week we will start With Great Power.<br/>* However, there is a clause: I expect my copy of REIGN to come in sometime this week. If it sings to me, and I can get through some of it, we will ditch WGP for Reign for a few weeks first.<br/><br/><b>My Weekly Group:</b> Next few weeks we will be playing a RISUS game inspired by Vampire Hunter D and Mythic Russia: The year is THE FUTURE, and in the post-apoc wilderness of Russia, demon hunters track down lone creatures. The first session totally worked out well, and this game is giving me more ideas for a rewrite of my stalled "The Ghost Killers" game. I'm just about ready for a rewrite and replay.<br/><br/>Before that, we played some Tenra Bansho, which was kind of painful, honestly. I found out the following:<br/>1) My weekly group is already distractable.<br/>2) However, given focus, they are awesome roleplayers, down to a (wo)man.<br/>3) Tenra is an awesome game for a GM and 2-4 players. In fact, the group resources pretty much indicate that 4 players is the "max".<br/>4) With 5 players, things get strained but if you can maintain focus, it can be fun. But it definitely takes longer.<br/>5) With 5 players in my weekly group, running Tenra is an exercise in herding cats.<br/><br/>Other:<br/><br/>In June (Sat June 16th), I'm throwing a housecon. I'm organizing it now. It will focus on laid-back gaming, and mostly playtesting of area designers' designs (and perhaps an actual game or two of Something Already Published). Expecting about 10-13 people, dividing up into 3 groups for play. EDIT: As an aside, if you're in the Triangle NC around that time, whisper me!<br/><br/>In July, some of us are going to Nerdly/GoPlay South-East (which is actually Tennessee). I'm really looking forward to that. It sounds like a lake house, no slasher,just laid back relaxed gaming with Andrew and folks.<br/><br/>In August, it has been decided that I am going to GenCon.  In fact, I'm going to soon start organizing SHADOW GENCON. SHADOW GENCON. Is basically going to be a con within a con: There's usually that gaming in the cafe of the hotel after hours.  But what about DURING hours? I will try to volunteer at Kat's gaming thingy, but in the interim I want to contact other friends who are not running a booth, and organize laid-back schedule-free gaming in the open gaming areas.  More on that soon.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AdamK" title="AdamK"><img alt="AdamK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AdamK">AdamK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73931/#Comment_73931" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T08:38:06+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  8:38AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started GMing Burning Wheel.

We started out using the Everway rules, but a couple of the players felt that they were (at least psychologically) not very empowered by the rules, so last night we switched to an unholy frankenstein system of OTE character description and task resolution overlayed with Mortal Coil's Passions, Magic Tokens, and Power Tokens. Everyone liked the switch, despite the fact that the two fighty characters (ex-Joanite Templar and ex-Yagan Reaver) are much less badass under the new rules.  We're playing the metaplot and just finished "Enemy of my Enemy" last night.<br/><br/>Ran a Mortal Coil one-shot a couple of weeks ago and enjoyed it, and folks want to do another one soon.<br/><br/>Played a <a href="http://mazesandminotaurs.free.fr/" rel="nofollow">Revised Mazes and Minotaurs</a> one-shot last Sunday and it was a blast.  For those who haven't sen this, it's a true labor of love.  The premise of the project is that rather than being influenced by Tolkien and the Middle Ages, the first RPG was influenced by Greek Myths and the ancient world.  The game texts are full of funny takes on D&amp;D and gaming history, and the game itself is very playable and fun in an Old School, Basic D&amp;D way.  Plus, it looks great and is totally free.<br/><br/>T8 should keep us occupied for the rest of the summer, but if I can  swing a longer running Mazes and Minotaurs game, I'll be all over it.<br/><br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73964/#Comment_73964" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T09:53:52+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  9:53AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2007 11:13AM by J_Walton.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Weekly:</b><br/><br/>For StoryGames Boston, who knows?

Three other players, running protagonists serving the Allies in trying to stop the Axis' nefarious arcane and mad science schemes.<br/><br/>I'm playing in a kinda-monthly PTA game called Ill Met by Gaslight -- murder and intrigue in the latter part of Victoria's reign.  Although this is (at best) a once-monthly game, it's probably the most RELIABLE game.   The four players (counting the producer) include my fiance, who still lives in NYC, and we play on the weekends when she's in town.  As a result of this narrow window of opportunity, the sense is that we HAVE to play when she's in town.<br/><br/>I am organizing a "floating pick-up game"-style Spirit of the Century campaign which may involve as many as 10 or more players, with rotating GMing.  Everyone (including potential GMs) will make up characters, and whoever can show up that Sunday will play -- this is going to push a lot of focus (I think), meaning each session MUST *end* the adventure in some definable fashion.  The chargen party/barbeque is this Sunday.  I'm very excited about this.<br/><br/>I have a five-player clockpunk TSOY game that I've run about two sessions of and can't seem to get the players scheduled regularly for. This makes me a little sad, but I kind of feel like all six of us have to want to actually do it to make it happen, and I don't think that's the case right now.<br/><br/>I have a Mortal Coil game for just myself and two other players who live nearby, for those weekend when we want to do something and no one else is available.  This has a strong player overlap with the Strange Allies game, though, and right now the Strange Allies game would be what we'd play, if the one other person was also available.<br/><br/>Finally, I'd like to go back and run some more stuff with the Dogs characters we made for for the town of Virtue, but that's really a catch as catch can situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73975/#Comment_73975" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T10:29:46+00:00" title="June  6, 2007 10:29AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We'll be continuing the second season of our <em>PTA</em> game, <em>Conservancy of Gears</em>, on a very erraticaly weekly basis.<br/><br/>After that, we're due to playtest Jesse's <em>Silent Sound</em>.<br/><br/>There's also a biweekly (sort of) <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> game in the works where I actually get to play, not GM.

Everyone has now got the hang of the system enough that I just need to turn up to a session with a few antagonists, a general situation and an opening scene (always in medias res and always opening the the line "Thirty seconds ago, X seemed like a good idea...") and I can count on players to pump in all the energy they can.<br/><br/>Next Tuesday I start running a new weekly PtA game, spun off from a one-shot I did a while back, called Mooks.  The premise is that the prestigious Mooks recruitment agency -- purveyors of quality henchmen to evil overlords, mad scientists and supervillains the world over -- has just opened its door to a fly-on-the-wall TV crew, who will follow the lives of the men and women who make up the organisation, their clients and the staff they place.  When I ran the one-off, the Venture Brothers hadn't aired; now it's difficult to imagine this game without its influence.<br/><br/>I'll be doing some playtesting over the next few weekends, with Lost Days of Memories and Madness this weekend and, possibly, Dirty Secrets the week after.<br/><br/>Last Tuesday I ran the Unknown Armies one-shot, Jailbreak, with a full complement of nine players.  I pitched it as halfway between a tabletop game and a LARP -- I used props, didn't allow a gaming table and, having the use of a big room, encouraged people to move around and act things out.  It was one of the most manic GMing experiences of my life and an absolute blast.<br/><br/>Oh, and my friend Robin is going to start running his Cold City campaign a week on Saturday.  I'm really looking forward to this.  I played in a one-shot that Malcolm Craig ran at the last Concrete Cow, and I'm completely sold on the game.<br/><br/>It's a full life!

Last time I ran my first playtest of Console Legends, which people had some fun with, but which had MAJOR problems (i.e. the main conceit of the game failed and the central mechanic doesn't work the way I want it to.) Back to the drawing board. Last time we played Castlevania, I shit you not. I ran it with Donjon. The players ended up betting on which Belmont would beat Dracula first, and then rigging the game.<br><br>Hopefully Drew's running Truth &amp; Justice on Sundays, so I can play my fatso construction worker speedster. We'll see. If not, I'll throw something together.<br><br>Also, I finally got to the Night Elves missions in Warcraft III. I haven't played for a while, and now I have free time.

After decades of HERO worship, I'm finding that using HERO for non-supers stuff really bores me. Anyway...<br/><br/>My Saturday crew started the Eberron adventure <i>Eyes of the Lich Queen</i> last weekend, which I'm running. Some of the most enjoyable D&amp;D I've played in a while. It should go at least another eight sessions or so, after which we'll either return to my friend's AoW campaign or, *gasp*, play a d20 game that is not D&amp;D. Not sure what, though.<br/><br/>My Monday crew has been missing a lot of sessions, but we'll likely be finishing up our four-plus-years-running D&amp;D campaign by Fall and then disbanding as a group. It's been an awesome run, but our schedules just aren't playing nice.

We have did chargen a week ago and played the first big fight scene this weekend.  Only did the one big fight, however:<br/><br/>Five PCs.<br/>One named NPC enemy.<br/>Two groups of enemy mooks.<br/>Two groups of allied mooks.<br/>Roughly 28 zones on the map (over half of them aerial,  about 15 of which saw heavy use.)<br/>About five declares and maneuvers (in five exchanges) to add environmental aspects and the like.<br/><br/>That was our 'training wheels' fight.  Yes it took awhile, but every exchange got faster and faster, and in the middle of the third exchange, one of the really not-rulesy people commented "you know, this is taking some time, but I'm having FUN."<br/><br/>So... yeah.
