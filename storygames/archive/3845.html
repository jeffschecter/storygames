This is why there will be two Custodians, so they can cover eachother.  Take turns. <br/><br/>If your not the assigned Table Custodian but an enthusiastic Gm you need only bring a game that you want to run for the Table.  Last year we did not lack for players and this year I'd be surprised if there were a lack of willing players for any game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86214/#Comment_86214" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T13:19:07+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  1:19PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So as a guy with free time, some prep and enthusiasm, I can just show up and offer to run games?

So don't worry about that.<br/>Ryan, since your doing 2 shifts as Table Custodian, all you need to do is prepare an indie game (or a couple of indie games) that you have the most fun running.  Make sure its a game you can run in 4 hours or less.  <br/>When players come only offer to run what you feel comfortable playing.<br/><br/>If they are stoked about a new indie game that they just bought and no one can run it, show them the Meet-up Board and give them Post-its and markers.  Have them write "Needs GM" on the post-it along with the game  and the time they want to play it.  There is a good chance that someone will come by and want to run it for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller" title="Kat Miller"><img alt="Kat Miller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.enter.net/~whim/picks/ittykat.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller">Kat Miller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86316/#Comment_86316" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T16:49:59+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  4:49PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2007 4:51PM by Kat Miller.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gaerik</cite><br/>Here's how I did things.

I think G.O.D. is going to do well this year.  I have one extra duty to suggest for custodians, and that is to keep an active eye out for potential players.  I know last year I felt strangely shy about approaching the on demand tables, in part because I didn't know anyone there, but also because it was hard to tell what was going on at the table.  If someone had looked up to the door and said "Hey! You wanna play a game?  Have a seat!" I would've probably fallen right in.

I think that the (sorta unfortunate) fact is that, as Kat says, one Custodian at most should be running at a time, so that he is free to do so without the trouble of admin work. The other person can then also do the watching out for new players and such. Otherwise you really have nobody to give any attention to the organizing aspect of things. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, it's going to be a real temptation not to grab a table and run something if you're like me and Andrew. I know that when I was covering last year, that I was not nearly attentive enough, and focused on the games I was running. We really just have to bite the bullet, and sit out for a while, I think. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not on the schedule this year, but I might offer to spend a slot or two doing some extra admin and recruiting should there be a lot of games going on. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you'll find is that a lot of the people who show up help out in a lot of capacities. Ryan, it's quite social, not at all what I think you imagine. It's not:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer We've Never Heard Of: I understand that you're offering to run games on demand? I want to play Rifts! Run it for me now!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's more like:<br/>\n<br/>\nJason Morningstar, Remi, and Judd: What's going on? <br/>\nMike: Thomas is about to run some Heroquest for Shreyas and myself. Dude, you guys should totally play.<br/>\nJason et al: We're in!<br/>\n<br/>\n(Cue game where Judd's medusine basilisk ranch owner ends up marrying her own sex slave played by Remi, amongst other developments). <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, there's just discussion about who is present, who is ready, willing, and able to run what, and then games form up. The "on demand" part really refers to you being able to show up at any time and find people to play with in relatively short order. Like as soon as four or five people show up, games seem to just start spontaneously. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
