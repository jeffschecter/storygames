But "yes" doesn't always mean "yes". <br/><br/>It may not 100% be my responsibility to know if yes is yes, ideally people will be truthful, but I want to ask permission in a way that gets me that truth. My goal isn't "get what I want". It's "would this be fun for you?"<br/><br/>How do you ask permission without pressure? Without persuasion?<br/><br/>Say I ask, "would it be cool if our characters are fighting to win Jack's affection?" Plenty of people who aren't interested will simply say no, or offer an alternative. But others find it difficult to say no. They may not want to come off negative. Or maybe they feel social pressure. Whatever the reason, they may agree without wanting to. <br/><br/>How do I ask, "would it be cool if our characters are fighting to win Jack's affection" without pressure? Or in a way that helps you feel comfortable to be truthful? Especially at conventions with strangers.<br/><br/>Of course there is the further complications of saying "yes" but changing your mind later. Or simply not understanding what you were saying "yes" to before the game started. But we can tackle those separately. <br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Itiro" title="Itiro"><img alt="Itiro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Itiro">Itiro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305411/#Comment_305411" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T12:38:28+00:00" title="December 21, 2010 12:38PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe if you start in a impersonal way with something like "What do you think about characters fighting to win another character affection?" you could get a more truthful answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305413/#Comment_305413" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T12:45:56+00:00" title="December 21, 2010 12:45PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You have to start long before you ask permission.  <br/><br/>Example: "When someone asks you, this is NOT brainstorming, where we want to be positive and support each other's ideas.

You didn't really suggest that as an option, but I wanted to point out that I like the idea that what's being queried is not me or my feelings but my aesthetic sense - as one player to another, do I think that this turn of events would fit the ideal way I imagine the game taking shape?<br/><br/>Now of course in practice if what's really at stake is my emotions, that's going to color my response. But in a way it lets me save face if I can present it as an aesthetic decision: "no I don't think that makes sense" is easier to say than "no I will be enraged if anyone threatens me as a rival for Jack" or "no it squicks me out that you even think that about my character" or whatever.<br/><br/>I've dealt with a number of people (men) in a roleplaying context where they act like even admitting they have feelings is seen as a sign of weakness, so they come up with false-logical pretexts to act on their emotions; "is it cool if?" presents the impersonal response as an option because "you" isn't even in the sentence.<br/><br/>Hope we get the chance to play together at Recess and test this theory!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305424/#Comment_305424" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T13:09:11+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  1:09PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>How do you ask permission without pressure?

I think "Would it be cool if?" are the perfect words; beyond that, it's all about body language, facial expression, inflection, etc.<br/><br/>If you really, really want to be sure not to be pushy, you can always raise pros and cons yourself, just to illustrate that either answer is acceptable.  I sometimes do this when playing with shy strangers.  It tends to go like:<br/><br/>"Would it be cool if our characters are fighting to win Jack's affection?  I mean, that might be a little too teenage melodrama...  But, maybe we can do it right, and set up some tense intrigue!  Or maybe that's hard, and it'll more likely come out silly.  Should we give it a shot?"<br/><br/>Players who don't have any better ideas will often say, "Okay, sure," just for the sake of moving forward.  But hopefully it'll be a little warmer, fuzzier, "Okay, sure," than if they were simply ordered around.  For a particularly unenthusiastic "Okay, sure," I might continue:<br/><br/>"Well, maybe we can do something better.  Any ideas?  No?  Well, maybe our characters are fighting to manipulate Jack, rather than seduce him?  Is that cooler?

Something that's often stressed is the value of avoiding questions with yes or no answers if you actually want to know what people think.<br/><br/>I know it could feel like taking it a bit far (especially since the wording might make it sound like more of a big deal than it is), but asking "How would you feel about our characters are fighting to win Jack's affection?" makes it impossible to give the false, easy yes.<br/><br/>Of course, it might lead to a false "Sure, that'd be cool", but maybe there'd also be enough hesitation before hand to signal that it's actually not that cool.<br/><br/>Asking questions is tricky business.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305456/#Comment_305456" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T14:58:45+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  2:58PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite><cite>Posted By: NomdePlume</cite><br/>No, because even if you do that, many people will respond in the ways John described in the OP.</blockquote>\nAnd then you have to be tactful and respectful in response.<br/><br/>I know I'm not the greatest communicator, but I think I can safely assume John is generally tactful and respectful, both when asking questions and answering them. So perhaps that isn't enough. I do agree though, it is an essential component - a foundation on which to build.<br/><br/>I think one problem is, many people think being "tactful and respectful" is "avoid confrontation and don't hurt their feelings", as John suggested. So they will compromise their own fun, because they worry that if they don't, they'll spoil other people's fun. There's a lot of second-guessing that can go on.<br/><br/>The same situation crops up (probably a lot worse) when you're the GM and ask the same kind of questions as players. The extra authority granted by the GMing position in many games exarcebates things. So, whatever techniques you use as GMs to talk to players in ways that encourage them to be willing to open up might well work when you are a player too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305457/#Comment_305457" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T14:59:55+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  2:59PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>JD, I've had plenty of success doing that with friends, but I've never tried it with strangers (e.g. at a con).

If I'm not open to their ideas, if I don't want to try out a new experience, I wouldn't sit down. This means some con experiences are crappy and nobody can avoid them being crappy without giving up the experience.  So my answer is that <i>for the most part</i>, convention experiences can't work like that.<br/><br/>Now, if you had a convention where the purpose of the 4 hour session wasn't just "hey, come and try this game!", but instead was "let's practice and learn together to improve ourselves and our play", that would be different. But game conventions are not like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305464/#Comment_305464" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T15:36:17+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  3:36PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What game are you playing where you ask permission for stuff like this?<br/><br/>I guess my position is that sometimes things happen in games which aren't cool and which aren't fun.

We tend to rationalize our decisions after the fact:  so we'll often say to ourselves "I must be cool with this, otherwise why did I say so?".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305574/#Comment_305574" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T10:29:14+00:00" title="December 22, 2010 10:29AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "What do you think about &lt;inset cool thing here&gt; as an option?" is perhaps better than "Hey, can we do &lt;cool thing&gt;?", but in general I'm thinking good pre and post gaming chat (also with small break to discuss how things are going hen appropriate) where you discuss these matters honestly would be best.

Like Keith suggests, being willing to discuss the stuff that happened after the game, or before the next game, really helps.<br/><br/>But getting to this quickly and easily with strangers... that's much more of a challenge, and I haven't done enough gaming with strangers to really feel confident I have the answers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
