As I mentioned then, there's a bunch of scenarios I've written for the game in Finnish that are waiting in the translation queue for me or somebody else to bother to put into English. I recently translated <a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/scenarios/doku.php?id=hellraisereng" rel="nofollow">my Hellraiser scenario</a> that I'm happy enough to bring up for consideration here. Mainly I'm motivated by showing off my writing in a snappy little package, of course, but there are a few points of interest here on top of that, too.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://www.mauvais-genres.com/20017-thickbox_default/hellraiser-movie-poster-20x28-in-1992-clive-barker-doug-bradley.jpg" style="float: left;" width="250 px"/>First, to get it out of the way: I just think that <i>Hellraiser</i> is a really cool horror property. I am particularly fond of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser_(franchise)#Comic_books" rel="nofollow">the early '90s anthology comics</a> which I think capture what is best in Hellraiser as a franchise: provocative, contradictory world-building, storytelling that is static in terms of plot while being thematically meaningful. It's all over the place, being written and drawn by whomever, but that just adds to the charm. The authors have no clue whatsoever what to do with Clive Barker's central ideas, and they're being asked to stretch those few concepts out into dozens of stories. To top it off, apparently the suits didn't really care about what the comic book did, considering how horrorful it managed to be. For me personally Hellraiser was a first experience of horror that had intricate mythological world-building like <i>Dracula</i>, but that was <i>also</i> angry, counter-cultural and violent.<br/><br/>(The movie's not such an emotional thing for me. I might not be a movie person in general, but mainly I just think that it's average. The moralistic yet ambiguous storyline is good, the phantasmagoric ideas are great and the monsters are fine, but for me it's nowhere near the top of the horror movie canon. It's the perfect <i>Sorcerer</i> movie, though. Important as a case study, I might say, while being only average to watch.)<br/><br/>That aside, <i>Hellraiser</i> makes a good case study for something that I've been talking about when it comes to a certain topic that crops up a lot particularly in more traditional RPG circles. That topic is often termed such:<br/><br/>"How to adventure in the world of a pre-made story?"<br/><br/>I have literally witnessed this topic of discussion for 20 years, and it was probably going on even before then. It's an immediate question when it comes to playing something like the <i>Middle-Earth Roleplaying Game</i> or other such license games based on novels or movies or such: given that the Big Story that the setting is built around is already in existence, canonical, cut and dried, what is it that you actually <i>do</i> with all this material?<br/><br/>My personal breakthrough on the matter occurred in the mid-'00s, in the hot Forge years. I was playing a lot of <i>My Life with Master</i>, <i>Dust Devils</i> and similar drama games at the time. One particularly boring day the crew wanted to play something so I just decided that heck, we might as well throw <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> into <i>Dust Devils</i> and see what comes out. Not like I hadn't played the game in all sorts of settings before, and like many fantasy hobbyists, I could quote LotR in my sleep anyway, so it'd be a good opportunity to share my love of the books with the youngsters I was gaming with at the time.<br/><br/>My big breakthrough in how to go about this sort of "novel adaptation" was to be entirely committed to the creative inspiration of the source work while simultaneously being entirely unconcerned about enforcing canonical story direction or setting detail. When you already have a game that <i>precisely</i> determines who gets to say what when, why would you need an additional busybody hovering over everything with the canon hammer?<br/><br/>This being the insight, my LotR scenario became a great success: I told the players that we would be starting from what the lore knows as the Council of Elrond, and you could make your own character if you wanted to, but I would love it if you chose to play one of the people from the book, instead. No pressure about portraying them correctly: we would go through their background and identity quickly, and after that it'd be 100% your character, nobody else gets to tell you "what Frodo would do". The plot would be entirely up for grabs, too: you tell us what your character thinks would be the best course forward here, when the story is on the brink of destiny, and if somebody disagrees they can very well go to conflict over it like a man, or keep their peace, compadre, like you're supposed to in <i>Dust Devils</i>.<br/><br/>The story we got out of this approach was great because it managed to simultaneously be very LotR-colored without being at all like it in terms of plot. It was the first time I used the Middle-Earth at a roleplaying game table in an emotionally authentic way, as something other than a background for weak ersatz-D&amp;D. <i>Dust Devils</i> obviously made things very tense, very sudden, very bloody in its own inimitable style.<br/><br/>So that's my "secret recipe" for how to grab an arbitrary movie or novel or whatever and "play it": you take the setting, the characters, the themes, and you input them into a game that gives you dramaturgical constraint. Hilarity ensues as the players bring their interest in the original material, while the game brings its own ideas of how, exactly, you craft your story. You get a very real sense of the setting and characters, and who cares if the plot will be different? That's just about the best part, a new story.<br/><br/><i>Entropy</i> works well for this purpose, whence my Hellraiser case study. The scenario text is intended to support both Hellraiser-knowledgeable and green groups of players, obviously. You just grab the central facts of the property (as laid out in the scenario text) and go, make your own story. It doesn't have to be the same as the original.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469348/#Comment_469348" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-27T04:49:25+00:00" title="January 27, 2018  4:49AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2018 2:20PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>This is a pretty fascinating post. Playing in a well-loved setting or story, is, as you say, one of the Holy Grails of roleplaying. And, of course, I'm also preparing at some point to write a scenario for Entropy myself.<br/><br/>Let me see if I got this right:<br/><br/>In short, your recommended approach is...<br/><br/>1. Take a preset chunk of canon material to use as your basic Situation or starting point or whatever. Don't be afraid to be quite faithful to the material. This creates a familiar base or starting point, anchored in the canon.<br/><br/>2. From there, follow the procedures of your chosen game system, without regard for how that might distort or change the property. (Almost as though you were pretending now, in step two, that you weren't familiar with the material at all!)<br/><br/>3. Play! Follow it where it leads. The joy comes from enjoying the contrast between those two things, and seeing where they contradict each other and lead you somewhere new.<br/><br/>Is that the idea?<br/><br/>(As a side note, I really hope you're familiar with <a href="http://ymarkov.livejournal.com/270570.html" rel="nofollow">The Last Ringbearer</a>. If not, you should read it immediately! <br/><br/>EDIT: some notes from the description, and a quote by the author:<br/><br/><i>"Dr. Yeskov, a professional paleontologist whose job is reconstructing long-extinct organisms and their way of life from fossil remnants, performs essentially the same feat in The Last Ring-bearer, reconstructing the real world of Tolkien's Arda from The Lord of the Rings - the heroic tales of the Free Men of the West written in that world. We have a pretty good idea how well heroic tales map to reality from our own world..."</i><br/><br/><i>"I can somewhat understand the feelings of \u201cprofessional\u201d Tolkien fans who foolishly parted with their money to buy this [...] please understand that this was not written for you! If you do grab something not meant for you \u2013 which ought to be obvious after reading about three paragraphs, n'est-ce pas? \u2013 then don\u2019t whine like an Arkansas bumpkin who got taken by The Royal Nonesuch."</i>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469350/#Comment_469350" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-27T13:33:22+00:00" title="January 27, 2018  1:33PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>My big breakthrough in how to go about this sort of "novel adaptation" was to be entirely committed to the creative inspiration of the source work while simultaneously being entirely unconcerned about enforcing canonical story direction or setting detail.

And yeah, Paul, I think you grok this - I'm not presenting anything revolutionary here, just trying to be concise about a neat trick that I don't see people doing nearly as much they should. I mean, <i>Dragonlance</i> is just about the only big-name RPG product that outright advocates "playing the novels", and even there the rpg stuff was first, or nearly so. It works much better than one would assume just by looking at how rarely people just go "I'll play Frodo, I'll bet I understand him better than Tolkien ever did".<br/><br/>Or, in the case of <i>Hellraiser</i>: who has the chops to do it without the simplification or outright ignorance of the philosophical ideas that making a movie involves, or the geek cruft that comics accumulate?<br/><br/>But let's see what I meant earlier:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" rel="nofollow">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>"[C]ommitted to the creative inspiration of the source work while simultaneously being unconcerned about enforcing canonical story direction".  Let's start here.</p></div></blockquote>\nWhat I mean by this is simply that narrative art consists of layers, structurally speaking, yes? Not everybody conceives of their creative process structurally, but the structure nevertheless exists in how we allocate meaning. One possible way to perceive this structure is in terms of themes in potential (what we used to call a "premise" at the Forge, as per Lajos Egri and Ron Edwards) that become thematic meaning in the actual story. That is, we can distinguish between the message of a story, the building-blocks of the story, and the actual story, even if the only thing we have at the end is the actual story. Something like this:<br/><br/><b>Abstract:</b> We exist as cognitive beings who exchange ideas.<br/>-&gt;<br/><b>Theme I want to discuss as an artist:</b> Clive Barker in <i>Hellraiser</i> wants to help you confront your own ideas about BDSM. J.R.R. Tolkien in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> wants to talk about true humility and nobility.<br/>-&gt;<br/><b>A narrative world pertaining to the theme is created:</b> Clive Barker invents phantasmagoric concepts like the Cenobites and the Lament Configuration. He puts a lot of work in visceral visual conceptualization of the Cenobites as inhumanly extreme body-modifying BDSM hedonists. J.R.R. Tolkien goes crazy working out languages and mythologies that express the mythic worldview of his themes.<br/>-&gt;<br/><b>An actual story is constructed out of the legos:</b> Clive Barker populates his fantasy with a few hedonistic-yet-normal people whose actions will activate the engine of his hedonism-turned-into-fantasy-imagery. A few "normal people" victims too, for the ensuing carnage, and to provide contrast. J.R.R. Tolkien likewise sets up some hobbits and warrior princes to provide an extreme contrast of humility between the two.<br/>-&gt;<br/><b>Concrete:</b> Here's a book, maybe read it sometime?<br/><br/>So when I said that I want "commitment to the creative inspiration of the source work", I meant that you can't just take the narrative world out of the above process and apply your own superficial preconceptions to it. That's how you get something like the <i>Middle-Earth Roleplaying Game</i>: a gamer geek's understanding of The Lord of the Rings as a backdrop for D&amp;D adventure.<br/><br/>Rather, you need to take the entirety of the thematic stage-setting seriously, from the beginning of that creative process up to the stage of world creation. You don't only take the name of "Lothlorien" and the image of elves living in a forest; you also need to take the literally inhuman philosophical significance that Tolkien gives his elves. This requires understanding and appreciating the original work, of course - if all you see in Hellraiser is actors in funny monster suits, and all you see in LotR is long-winded tourist gazetteer, then of course your own "take" on the material is going to be just as shallow.<br/><br/>If everything goes well, what you do in your exegesis of the original work is that you successfully create a "lego set" of places, people and events that are infused with their original meaning. You might drop some stuff that's in excess of what you're doing with the stuff. You <i>will</i> drop the actual plot, because the point of playing with that lego set is to experience the material through your own story creation, which may or may not lead to essentially the same story. (Hellraiser, for example, in <i>Tales of Entropy</i>: will you <i>really</i> make a story that won't essentially be "somebody calls the Cenobites, and their mysterious fantasy reality completely redefines everybody's dramatic priorities"?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469355/#Comment_469355" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-27T15:37:36+00:00" title="January 27, 2018  3:37PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So we understand the legos, yes? The Lament Configuration, Pinhead, even Frank Cotton are all legos in the sense we can detach them from their original story and just use them for our re-telling. As per the rules of <i>Entropy</i> we add some legos of our own during character creation, too. <i>Lords of the Rings</i> has much, much more legos than Hellraiser due to the nature of the work, but the principle is the same - more legos just means that you need to create less yourself, and you have more options for incorporating them in different ways.<br/><br/>I said earlier "while simultaneously being unconcerned about enforcing canonical story direction" as the other thing you need to handle in addition to creating your legos correctly. This simply means that you can't get emotionally or intellectually attached to that most superficial layer of a narrative work, the actual plot. When you play the Council of Elrond (it's a really good starting point for giving this treatment to LotR, I recommend it highly) you can't think in terms of what happened in the original story; you must think about what your character wants and why, and what they're willing to do to get their way. You need to use the rules, and if those rules say that Boromir punches Elrond and browbeats Gandalf, then off we go to Gondor to see what the One Ring might do for the war effort. Use the hobbits a cobblestones or something, we're setting mythical humility aside (and regretting that greatly later on, obviously, when the internal logic of the thematic story universe catches up with our choices).<br/><br/>When writing that <i>Hellraiser</i> scenario I had to think pretty hard on who I'd choose for my pivot character, and what situation I would start the scenario in. I didn't even particularly need to go with the actual characters and situations from the movie; the archetypal content of Hellraiser is literal demon-summoning, it would be just as much "the Hellraiser experience" if I made up my own demon-summoning situation. I'm happy with Frank from the movie, though: he presents the fundamental existential motivation for summoning demons, and the most superficial misunderstanding of the Cenobites possible. Obviously the moment I chose for the game's "kicker" (the dramatic moment to start the game from) was a little before Frank actually manages to solve the Lament Configuration; the scenario is simple, there isn't any real choice in the matter. Frank without the Lament Configuration is just a sad and superficial asshole, and Frank after he opens the gate - well, those who know the story know that the event limit his dramaturgical options rather severely.<br/><br/>But making that choice for when to start the story, I <i>have to</i> accept that Frank may choose to not solve the Lament Configuration. Or most hilariously, perhaps he <i>fails</i>? (I would totally ask for a success in conflict to open the LeMarchand puzzle box; it's a constant conceit in the Hellraiser stories that the puzzle is far from trivial, on many different levels.) What happens then? It depends on what other characters we have in the game, maybe the players chose to create their own cast (probably more colorful than the original, considering the tastes of gamers - demon-hunters and such, perhaps). It will certainly be far different from the original story.<br/><br/>I wouldn't otherwise harp so much on abandoning the canon, except the rpg culture is historically so very biased on this single point that I feel that it requires extra emphasis. It's a simple idea, obvious really, that if you give players some characters to play and expect them to play them as per the game's rules, then <i>of course</i> they're going to make their own choices, and you can't be second-guessing them all the time. Except obviously when we look at how license RPGs get played, the second-guessing is rife: "no, an elf would never do that", "no, the Star Fleet is going to prevent you from doing that", "no, that character is not available because as per the chronology he is currently in King's Landing".

Thanks for that. And then for the subject at hand.<br/><br/>We have discussed about this issue back and forth in irc for years now and Eero's take on this is very fresh, powerful and interesting. Usually the licensed role-playing games tend to leave the original story untouched and try to live in the outskirts of the given material, trying to get out something very similar to the original without tampering with it.<br/><br/>This is sometimes very frustrating, but it gets worse when they completely miss the target. There are, for example, star trek games out there that have a premise where characters start as young ensigns and start to grind their way up to the command chain ... to perhaps meet the criteria of a bridge officer after 30 or more sessions.<br/><br/>While this is a completely valid campaign for its own right, this is not star trek as I see it. Star trek for me is the cerebral story of bridge officers making some hard decisions in utopia setting as well as being awesome and/or growing in the process of doing that. For me if you play a trek game, you put a player in the captain's chair and then let the difficulties begin.<br/><br/>Speaking of star trek, a nice parody <a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/scenarios/doku.php?id=we_are_such_stuff_as_dreams_are_made_on" rel="nofollow">scenario</a> of trek was written by a friend. While this is not straightly canonical, the idea is clear enough for those who know trek. Not only we are invited to play star trek as it is, but to explore the ideas of it while taken to the extreme. In this case, what if captain Kirk was allowed to be awesome until old and semi-alcoholic state.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is an example of using canonical material "bravely", just as is Eero's take on Hellraiser.<br/><br/>I bet the LOTR scenario as well is coming at some point <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>Answers to Eero's questions:<br/>1) I know the Hellraiser by name, but do not know the IP more than that.<br/>2) -<br/>3) Clearest obstacle for Frank is his brother.

Either his new lover, or the brother's wife, whom he used for a long time but has now dropped. Three options here - I'm going to chooe the brother's wife as my character:<br/><br/>* She's simply *not done* with Frank yet. It's a powerful obsession - perhaps lust, perhaps love, or perhaps a desire to "win" their little game and dominate him. She can use his brother for leverage, of course.<br/>* She's entangled with the demonworld in some way. Perhaps one of the Order has taken Frank's place as her lover, and she is now in terrible danger. She calls on Frank to beg him to stop all this - the demons, the crazy wild stuff - and perhaps even to exorcise her new and inhuman lover.<br/>* She's entangled in some other problem - perhaps the criminal world is coming after her and her brother, and things are going to get ugly soon. She seeks to implicate Frank, and, quite possibly, only his demonic connections or the Lament Configuration give them a valuable edge or weapon in a war against a mafia cartel. <br/><br/>Perhaps her brother amassed wealth in some illegal fashion and it's finally caught up to him: mysterious hitmen are coming after him. The wife's goal here is to seduce Frank again and use him as a scapegoat (perhaps even presenting him to the mafia/cartel as "her husband" in hopes he gets killed instead of their real mark).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469366/#Comment_469366" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-27T22:03:17+00:00" title="January 27, 2018 10:03PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Eero, I'd love to hear your take on <i>Star Wars</i> in this context...</p></div></blockquote>\nThinking of the original movie specifically: wouldn't a game like Entropy want to interject itself around the point when Luke's life on Tatoine ends in flames alongside his uncle's farm? You've got Ben Kenobi (secret jedi master), the farmboy protagonist, a couple of droids, a crazy quest from a princess, impressive villain in Darth Vader and who knows what happens next. You can still bring in anything and everything from later on, but you can also choose not to.<br/><br/>Even better, I'm not really feeling that quest thing; it seems rather unnecessarily constraining when you've got a bunch of tale-spinners at the table and a game like Entropy that doesn't even like overarching quest arcs nearly as much as it likes moral conundrums and personal risks. Let's rather start with the following:<br/><br/><i>You're the princess with the enemy's war plan, and they're chasing you. Jedis and such exist in the world, but we haven't introduced any yet, and maybe never will. What do you do?</i><br/><br/>I like that better because it opens up the scenario more for everybody: no Ben Kenobi or Luke Skywalker unless you want them, for instance. (Isn't it interesting how easy Luke is to drop when you drop the plot? He isn't that intriguing himself.) No Tatoine, and that's something I can get behind after having it in just about every Star Wars movie ever. You still have the obvious pivot character around which the scenario development turns in princess Leia Organa. Could also do Darth Vader, naturally.<br/><br/>I am actually intrigued now by how natural it is to drop Luke Skywalker altogether. He's really a remarkable example of a Hollywood whiteboy filler protagonist. The movie works just fine with just Leia, Ben Kenobi (why not train a girl, and an accomplished one at that, as a jedi?) and Han Solo for masculine charm. I suspect that quite a few groups would end up not having any use for Luke while playing with these particular legos.<br/><br/>For Episode I my take would be simple, and I think it's the only take that makes sense: secret Sith lord chancellor is the pivot character, and you guys choose who you want to oppose his bid to undermine and destroy the Galactic Republic. It is practically impossible for you to choose as vapid a cast as the original work, so I expect great things [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469369/#Comment_469369" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-27T22:27:10+00:00" title="January 27, 2018 10:27PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2018 10:27PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent reply, Eero. I like your take on this!<br/><br/>I agree that Luke is absolutely easy to "drop" from the story without undue difficulties. However, I disagree that this is somehow unusual or strange.<br/><br/>Isn't that true of the formula for most epic fantasy fiction? (I'm consider Star Wars fantasy for purposes of looking at the plot; hopefully that doesn't offend anyone.)<br/><br/>It seems similarly easy to drop Frodo from Lord of the Rings (assume he died bringing the Ring to Rivendell after all, after instance, instead of recovering in their sickbay), although the presence of Leia as ALSO being a Skywalker makes it even starker in <i>Star Wars</i>.<br/><br/>But doesn't most fantasy depend on an "everyman" character like Luke or Frodo or Bilbo (or even Neo in the Matrix), who is clueless of the larger plot and its concerns, and gets thrown into it despite that? <br/><br/>I've always thought that the purpose of that viewpoint character as someone who doesn't understand what's going on is engineered specifically so that we, as the audience, can relate to them. In a foreign, fantastic environment, it helps to have a gawking farmboy who is shocked by everything he sees and needs to have it explained to him. That character is a stand-in for us, the audience.<br/><br/>Of course such a character could be easily removed from the actual plot in most cases, I would think. <br/><br/>Usually, in such stories, there is a "prophecy" (Neo, Luke) or Maguffin (Frodo, Excalibur, etc) which forces them into the spotlight, despite being entirely unsuited to being a major player in the Larger Plot otherwise. I am going to tentatively say that this is the very PURPOSE of that literary conceit - to justify making a relatable Everyman character the central character in a world-shaking story.<br/><br/>(This isn't a particularly considered theory of mine, so I'm happy to hear counterarguments. It seems to me that considering it is still somewhat relevant to our topic of designing scenarios based on fictional "properties" and settings.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469370/#Comment_469370" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-27T22:51:13+00:00" title="January 27, 2018 10:51PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't drop Frodo from LotR, no - he carries the central theme of humility. Without Frodo and the other hobbits you lose what is arguably the single most important idea in the novel: that it is more important to be virtuous than to be strong. Also, the secondary idea: the best way to be virtuous is to be a humble country squire, rather than a world-wise warlord or such. Arguably the only thing that the dramatic events of LotR are actually about is a deconstruction of paganic notions of virtue from a Christian perspective: Saruman falls despite his knowledge, Boromir falls despite his bravery, even the hobbit falls, yet is delivered by his humility and and faith in human nature.<br/><br/>Neo in Matrix is very similar to Luke Skywalker, yes. The thematic idea of a boddhisatva delivering the world from suffering is much stronger in Matrix, which makes a "generic" protagonist more useful, though. You could swap him for somebody who actually stands for something, but then you're just adding secondary thematic ideas - it's basically a "what if Buddha, instead of being a completely generic person - meaning a young white man insofar as America is concerned - was a woman or a socialist or a dog" alternative take. Fine for what it is, but the more exceptional and interesting your protagonist, the more the focus of the story will be on that instead of the general human yearning for enlightenment. Arguably, if you want to speak about enlightenment to America, you're going to have to do it with a 30-ish good-looking white male actor; somebody generic.<br/><br/>In comparison, I think that Star Wars has so much going on in terms of exotic content that swapping Luke for Leia wouldn't ruin the composition. Sure, so there are warrior princesses in the far-away galaxy, long ago?

(For instance, if Aragorn gave in to the Ring but was stopped by Gollum - whom he had saved earlier - it would be a weaker story, but still carry those themes, since Aragorn's struggle with kingship and the Ring itself would still be about humility in the end.)

If Aragorn was Frodo, then we would lack the class society setup that gives structure to the kind of world Tolkien imagines: Aragorn should <i>not</i> be forced to make humble choices at all, for he is a true hero and a true king. This is actually sort of what the ruling class does in LotR: they ask the humble subject to take on the difficult tasks so they don't have to. "I am too powerful, I would fail in this task" they say sincerely. It is not a good or bad thing that Aragorn is unable to be truly humble; it simply is the way it is with kings. Tolkien sort of criticizes rulership, but not really; what he is <i>really</i> after is the idea that you shouldn't wish to be more than you are.

My thinking in general is that ironic understanding among the audience/players is one of the primary levels of understanding in a roleplaying game at all, so when you add an explicit source text, <i>of course</i> you have to play with that all the time.

I especially like the idea to bring Darth Vader as a pivot character in this, because if you think of it, he is the only character who grows and changes during the original trilogy. He is the character who has come from being one of the good guys and now dropped in the top brass of an clearly fascist empire and ends up saving the rebellion. I would take him as a pivot, but include the information we have from the Return of the Jedi: There is still humanity in him, deep down there.<br/><br/>We have discussed back and forth about a LOTR scenario so maybe when it gets written (I don't trust my lazy bottom but perhaps miracles happen) it really gives some interesting insights. One would pick Gandalf as a pivot character here easily, as he is both tied to the fate of the ring permanently (having one of the elven rings) and doesn't have a kingdom on which he has to sit on when sh*t starts hitting the fan.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469399/#Comment_469399" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-28T19:30:50+00:00" title="January 28, 2018  7:30PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, the Gandalf scenario wouldn't have to start from the Council of Elrond at all. It tends to be my go-to example for this because of my Dust Devils experience, but for specifically Entropy, and specifically Gandalf, there could be other interesting starting points...<br/><br/>For instance, Tolkien makes much hay at multiple times from a sort of causal knowledge thriller: what does a character know at a given point in time, and how does this justify their actions. Gandalf particularly ends up often explaining about how he "only suspected that it might be the One Ring" or "did not know that Sauron knew" or whatever. This isn't just in LotR, it's also in the various appendices and unfinished tales and so on. For instance, Gandalf did a commando dive to Dol Guldur at one point simply to discover the identity of the "Necromancer", and found the lost dwarven king Thrain II in its prisons. I find it notable how much these Gandalf's jaunts are presented to <i>matter</i> in an otherwise epic storyline: for the want of a shoe the kingdom is lost, the story seems to say. Or rather not shoe, but some petty piece of information - the ring-wraiths would totally have captured Frodo if they'd been faster on the trigger, of he'd have tarried even a day longer before escaping the Shire. That's a very modern element in Tolkien's otherwise old-fashioned storytelling sensibility, I think. An agent thriller kind of thing.<br/><br/>(The ancient author would rather choose to swim in the ironic lack of knowledge on the parts of the characters, instead of justifying last-minute saves and sudden plot twists by acquired information. An old-fashioned story would be all "oh how tragic that you would marry your own mother for not knowing who she was", while Tolkien is like "ha ha, the reason for why Gandalf could only stop you from that marriage at the last minute is that he had to go to the libraries of Denethor to figure out that she's your mother.")<br/><br/>Given the above, how about starting the scenario <i>really</i> early? Like, right after Bilbo's adventure. The scenario text needs to outline very carefully what Gandalf <i>does</i> and does <i>not</i> know. He still thinks that Sauron is dead (he thinks that the Necromancer is one of the ring-wraiths), he still thinks that Saruman is an ally, he merely suspects the One Ring yet is unable to prove it one way or another without some heavy library diving. Perhaps most importantly: Gandalf does not yet know that the Third Age is coming to an end imminently, within the next generation. He knows his mission (to protect the world from the preternatural evil left over from the Silmaril War), but there is yet much about its specifics and scope that escape him, even at this late date. His only reason to suspect that hobbits might prove key to Fate's design is his theology (Gandalf's not omniscient, remember, and he doesn't remember everything about his previous life over the sea, and he does not have a straight line to Eru or anything like that) and personal gut instinct about what the world is like. All this, and he's still just about the only <i>Istari</i> who has not thoroughly forgotten and abandoned his assigned task, even if he goes about it in some pretty abstract way, hanging out with hobbits and such.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PetteriHannila" title="PetteriHannila"><img alt="PetteriHannila" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PetteriHannila">PetteriHannila</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469400/#Comment_469400" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-28T20:33:09+00:00" title="January 28, 2018  8:33PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see how that could work.

Lets say you have Gandalf, Boromir and Frodo as characters. Boromir would like to take the ring to Gondor with him and there would clearly be a conflict over this in the scene that contains the council of Elrond. If Boromir wins then the ring at least starts its journey towards Gondor, and immediately we deviate from the events of the book.<br/><br/>If not, then after the council there would be the passing of the mountains through Caradhras. If that succeeds then there is no need to go to Moria. If that fails well then there is the watcher in the water in the lake that threatens the party, maybe it takes someone with it. If not, then the orcs....<br/><br/>In a long game the probabilities for the story to deviate from original grow exponentially.

Basically two scenarios:<br/><br/><b>Somebody else is Narrator:</b> The Narrator player describes how the Ring is calling to you, and asks for conflict to sway you to the dark side. You presumably choose to resist (maybe not very hard, though). There's a conflict, Frodo vs. the Ring. The outcome determines whether Frodo succumbs to the Ring. If Gollum is a NPC and present, you would presumably call on him to "help", describing how him attacking Frodo here and now helps him remember himself. Or, the Narrator calls on Gollum to spark Frodo's feeling of ownership; the so-called "Grains player" (who has no character in the scene) makes the call on whom Gollum helps (in the abstract mechanical sense; in the fiction he's trying to help himself, of course).<br/><br/><b>You're the current Narrator yourself:</b> You decide whether the Ring is tempting Frodo right now or not. If it's not, or you just want to talk about it without putting any teeth in it, then there's no conflict and you can have Frodo do whatever you like. (You could declare conflict against your own character if you wanted to, too.) If you declare that Frodo decides to claim the Ring (essentially go insane; it's a really bad move rationally speaking at this point, speaking of how the Ring works), perhaps you'll narrate how he becomes invisible and disappears from his companions in the mountainous landscape of Mount Doom. End scene. Afterwards, the other players probably vote you a 2-point increase in Frodo's Shadow score, representing him giving in to the ultimate temptation.<br/><br/>I would consider it a totally weak-sauce game for playing LotR if you <i>couldn't</i> do internal character conflicts like that. There's no <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, and few other modern stories, without internal character conflict. The fact that Entropy conflicts don't need to be extremely serious in consequence should make it better than <i>Dust Devils</i> for playing LotR in this regard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PetteriHannila" title="PetteriHannila"><img alt="PetteriHannila" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PetteriHannila">PetteriHannila</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470500/#Comment_470500" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-09T17:26:00+00:00" title="March  9, 2018  5:26PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry to poke an old thread alive, but we talked so much about a LOTR scenario both here and on irc that I just had to write it.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/scenarios/doku.php?id=the_council" rel="nofollow">The Council</a>.<br/><br/>I picked the most obvious choice from Entropy's viewpoint, the council of Elrond.

The character writeups are full of actionable details.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
