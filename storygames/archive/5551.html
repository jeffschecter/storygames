This way, you front load the conflict and make all the interesting choices and creative input before actually "playing" (I know that a lot of people consider this to be "wrong" -well, it happens and I've definetely been involved in it).<br/>\nIn Nine Worlds you simply cannot do this! You start out by stating your goal of the conflict - but, and here's where the cool bits are, you cannot decide exactly what happens until you have drawn cards and chosen the Urge to use. <br/>\nWant to escape from prison? Great, that's your goal - but depending on whether you choose Chaos, Cosmos, Metamorphosis or Stasis, the narration, what actually happens will only be settled as you narrate. <br/>\nI love this feature.

Yesterday we played the second session over Skype/irc.<br/>\nHere's a little gem from the first session:<br/>\nPer's Archon, Deucalion, a doctor who helped develop the plague that's currently raging on Sol, is en route to Sol to attend a medical conference. One of Deucalion's Muses - check this out! - is to infect Apollo with the plague! But Apollo wants to destroy Deucalion, so he cannot spill the beans. Apollo's forces intercept Deucalion's aethership and we enter conflict mode. In one conflict, over several rounds, Deucalion escapes from his aethership (1st round), reaches Sol (2nd round) but is then caught by Apollo just as he is about to poison him (as Apollo is about to enjoy a show at the theatre). Apollo grins at Deucalion and says words to the effect: "Did you really think I'd set a disease loose on Sol that I wasn't immune to?". And then Apollo strikes Deucalion down, sending him directly to Hades (although mechanically, Deucalion isn't dead) (3rd round). All this from one conflict, using different Urges.<br/>\nCoolness!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy" title="Yokiboy"><img alt="Yokiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy">Yokiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124477/#Comment_124477" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T01:49:40+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  1:49AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pedyo</cite>Want to escape from prison?

I've played many story games now, but don't see how this is different from most conflict resolution systems. In most games I've played you state your intent/goal and then decide what stat/skill/ability to check and obviously the narration differ based on how you go about reaching your goal.<br/><br/>Anyhow, what makes Nine World different, and how is that so cool? I'm very intrigued.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pedyo" title="pedyo"><img alt="pedyo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pedyo">pedyo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124478/#Comment_124478" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T02:03:37+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  2:03AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Note that I'm not saying that most Story Games work in this manner! But some can be played in this, perhaps faulty, way. What springs to mind right now is PTA. You reach conflict and discuss the Stakes - this happens if I win, this happens if you win. If you are not careful, you may end up narrating the two different outcomes before resolution. All I'm saying is that Nine Worlds makes this almost impossible, and it's very noticable in play. You may have an idea of how you'll end up meeting your goal, but that idea may be totally screwed once you see your hand of cards. You wanted to create a new door in the wall of the prison that you want to escape (Cosmos) but ended up playing Stasis and decide to narrate that you freeze the guard in his tracks the next time he's in your cell, about to beat you up.<br/>\nDid this help explain my thoughts, Yoki?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20Ulricht" title="Thomas Ulricht"><img alt="Thomas Ulricht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20Ulricht">Thomas Ulricht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124482/#Comment_124482" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T03:42:36+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  3:42AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really enjoying this game, though Skype has given us som grief.<br/><br/>I agree that the fact that the cards dictate which urge will be the best to use, is brilliant. There a many considerations besides just deciding which urge will be the most powerfull in combination with the card suits. You also have to consider which urge will give you the most points to play with, or the least points if you're looking at failure, since your opponent will be stealing those. I like that the game can really be <i>gamed</i> and also that neither the PCs nor the GM has to hold back at all. Oh, and the setting is fantastic. <br/><br/>Looking forward to out next session. This time, hopefully, with voice chat that works. I'm looking at Ventrilo as an alternative, it looks simple enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy" title="Yokiboy"><img alt="Yokiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy">Yokiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124484/#Comment_124484" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T05:20:12+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  5:20AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2008 5:21AM by Yokiboy.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pedyo</cite>Did this help explain my thoughts, Yoki?</blockquote>\nYes, now I totally understand you. While I haven't played Nine Worlds, Dust Devils, also by Matt Snyder, is one of my favorite games. It also does what you're saying. In Dust Devils you declare your intent, then draw a poker hand, but it's the suits of the cards that determine how you win the conflict. You might have thought you were going to sweet talk your way through trouble, but the cards state that you use a violent approach. It is absolutely awesome in play!<br/><br/>Thanks for clarifying Peter,<br/><br/>Yoki                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124592/#Comment_124592" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T12:07:06+00:00" title="February  5, 2008 12:07PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always liked how each Urge could theoretically accomplish almost any goal, if you narrated it the right way, but the game came in the form of figuring out how to narrate using that Urge to accomplish that goal.
