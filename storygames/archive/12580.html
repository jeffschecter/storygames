A Blank would be useless, and discarded. A Minus would be a minor success, and you could use it against the Obstacle, but not the Consequences. And a Plus would be a major success and could be used against the Obstacle or the Consequences.<br/><br/>Now, normally, I hate Fudge dice (hate!

You may be used to running games in this style already, but I'm a firm believer that a more well-defined GM role is more solid design.

I hadn't considered that the two non-blank faces could be the useful ones rather than the non-Minus faces, but it's all equivalent anyway. As long as it's consistent in play, that's all that matters. I'll probably leave the current definition as it stands as d6 are more common than dF.<br/><br/>The setting is actually based on a manga/anime series (albeit with the serial numbers filed off). Perhaps you need to be familiar with that for the possibilities to jump out at you. I should probably insert some little bits of fiction to sell alchemy to the reader.<br/><br/>Paul, there's actually a whole other chapter for the GM that wasn't written when I posted the draft, with any luck there'll be enough material in there that the GM isn't left to her own devices. Among the specific things it deals with are how to set consequences, move scenes forward and construct the Conspiracy. Is there anything in particular that you think I should cover?<br/><br/>The playtest actually went far better than I had good reason to expect a playtest to go. The dice rolling resolution was slightly slower than your standard chuck dice/pass/fail but didn't bog down, even when there was a lot going on. There was a lot of investigation, brow-beating and sneaking around, and the final showdown was pyrotechnic but allowed the villain to escape. The characters felt solid, which is no mean feat in a one-shot, although coming up with the details for characters took longer than I anticipated it would. One of the players was completely new to roleplaying, and thoroughly enjoyed it, so that was good.<br/><br/>Thanks, all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282887/#Comment_282887" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T07:06:52+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  7:06AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2010 7:08AM by Johnstone.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Queex</cite><br/>The setting is actually based on a manga/anime series (albeit with the serial numbers filed off).

Pretty much how I envisage the industrialised country in the setting.<br/><br/>The problem I have is laying my hands on creative commons stuff. Flickr is good for photos, providing you want pictures of things people commonly take photos of. It has an illustration category, but there are nowhere near as many images, at least when searching for stuff I can use. People are probably more reluctant to put illustrations under the cc as they usually entail more work than a photograph. If I was more artistic I'd have a go at drawing some myself- but I have to ration my time carefully on these projects, particularly the longer texts. How would simple pencil sketches of objects found in the world grab you?<br/><br/>I plan on adding a map to the gazetteer section- but in keeping with the hook-first theme it'll be a map showing Stravian military expansion over the years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282916/#Comment_282916" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T09:37:46+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  9:37AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa, there. I wasn't advocating for you to do any actual work getting illustrations. I was just saying they'd be nice.<br/><br/>The only way to get really good illustrations is to either buy 'em or steal 'em. I don't see anything wrong with using somebody's images for prototyping purposes, to analyze the effect of images on text readability, and to do layout mock-ups. You'll need to collect those images anyway to use for a style guide if you want to actually pay people for original artwork. And you could always try to license old artworks from artists. That's kinda like free money for them, since they don't have to do anything new.<br/><br/>Alternately, you could use old Victorian photos and <a href="http://lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=499#3" rel="nofollow">do the lumpley</a> on them. It should be easy to add bizarre machinery and occult alchemy to spice them up. Or draw that stuff in.<br/><br/>Pencil sketches are fine with me.

Even if they take the normal (less serious consequence), it eats up a die so they're less likely to be able to fight back. So it was purely a balance thing. Then, I realised that keeping on recycling the same consequences in a contest (gum jams, out of ammo, shoot something you shouldn't, ad infinitum) would be lame, and this method meant that such risks only cropped up occasionally. It's the kind of thing you could house rule if you want, but I think it strikes a good balance as is.<br/><br/>Another thing is that my intention is that if you suffer a consequence in a contest, future potential consequences are something different. I haven't made that clear enough, so I'll revise the text when I get home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283072/#Comment_283072" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T05:34:47+00:00" title="July 27, 2010  5:34AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few other things:<br/><br/>Library, Rank, Standing, and Wealth are not abilities.

Don't put skills first: they rely on knowing something about having a character, and knowing something about rolling the dice. Right now, it's a bunch of info that's hard to make sense of. I would suggest starting with an explanation of the character sheet, or putting most of the skill info in character creation, and the list with possible consequences after character creation, or after you explain how to roll dice.</blockquote>\nI've changed the order in the working draft so it runs Gazetteer - Chargen - Skills - Rules - GM<br/>Do you think Chargen - Gazetteer - Rules - Skills - GM is a better order? Or keep the Gazetteer first? Someone else has pointed out that reader will probably gravitate to the chargen section, but as I found out on Saturday without a little context on the countries and background it's hard for players to pick what they want.<br/>I'm not so sure splitting up the different skill info stuff is wise, it's handy to have all the relevant references in one place. Maybe a super-summary of skills in chargen, and the full details later?\n<blockquote>Resolving an attack with a consequence to the opponent's next action gives combat a real swashbuckling, parry-and-riposte kind of feel. I like that.</blockquote>\nIt was one of the things I wasn't so sure of to begin with, but in play it works well. An unanticipated facet is that it gives a mechanism for a character to be under pressure- because he has a lot of consequences to deal with, he can't make much of an attack, which means his opponent doesn't have many potential consequences so can spend more dice on his attack, etc.<br/><br/>It's strange to think of how many rulesets have gone to great lengths to simulate that kind of thing (*cough* combat advantage *cough*), and it came about here by accident.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283078/#Comment_283078" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T06:28:59+00:00" title="July 27, 2010  6:28AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Queex</cite>I think maybe Assets is a better term</blockquote>\nOh, yes.

Then again, you have Engineer under Other, and that can be a military career as well.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Queex</cite>Maybe a super-summary of skills in chargen, and the full details later?</blockquote>\nYeah. If you explain the basics in chargen, readers will know what they are when reading Rules, then put the detailed Skills list after.<br/><br/><br/>It's probably a good idea to have the setting info first, so a reader can at least browse through it on the way to finding out how to make characters. Some readers will skip past the chargen and go straight to the Rules, of course, though perhaps not the majority.<br/><br/>I haven't read the Alchemy section, just skimmed it. Are you going to list multiple Backlash results in the final version (like you do for skills), or is there only one result for each school?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283138/#Comment_283138" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T14:08:22+00:00" title="July 27, 2010  2:08PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The latest version (still sans the GM section as yet): <a href="https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0BwGkynh3mSzPNjJhOTYxOWMtYTk4NS00MTk5LWFkZTYtOWU0MTdhYmFjZjZm&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow">link</a>.<br/><br/>I've re-ordered them.
