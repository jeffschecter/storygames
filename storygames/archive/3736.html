For a few weeks I have been struggling to find the final 'thing' that makes the game click with a more story aspect rather than a simple adventure base. On my holidays, lazing in the sun, I think I had my eureka moment, but I need to sensecheck it before I get all excited.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt revolves around 'Missions' and 'Challenges'<br/>\n<br/>\nThe games resolution system is currently conflict rather than task, with intent and stakes set, resolution carried out and then narration done based on stakes etc. These I have called challenges - so, for example, if (for want of an easier example) Sharpe is in a sword fight with a French captain, that is a Challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nDead easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have now had the idea of introducing Missions. Don't laugh, but I actually got part of the idea from World of Warcraft and Quests!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the characters (soldiers, naturally) are given a Mission - say 'Capture Major Del Monte'. This mission is rated as 6 Challenges, has one Complusory Challenge (they must actually capture the Major) and rewards them in some material and regimental way.  They also have a certain time limit on the completion of these Missions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea is that the players (as a troop of soldiers) lay out which four other challenges they would like to face in their pursuit of the Major. They lay down the plan for their mission. So if the Major is known to be holed up in an old Spanish fort, they may have to sneak into the fort and then fight their way out. Thats two challenges. They might want to engage the local Guerillas as well, thats another. They could encounter a cavalry patrol on their way in. Thats another one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI forsee that each player would have a number of Missions on the go at once - not all of them Military in nature. So say the groups Officer had a Mission that was 'Impress Lady Fitzwilliam' and he has one challenge left to win her good graces. He decides that he wants to face the Major in single combat, thus proving his martial prowess to his beloved. That adds another wrinkle to the session.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo add a final couple of wrinkles, obviously failure at any one challenge will change the flow of the plan. My idea is that this process gives the GM about the biggest set of flags and hooks to play with during the game. The players are laying down exactly the sort of conflicts they want to take place with a inbuilt reason for wanting to pursue those conflicts. They can also face setbacks - there is a mechanic where they can effectively gamble previous challenge successes against winning a current challenge, if they are faced with a really bad mismatch. If they win, great, but if they lose it sets them back massively and they have to start building and planning and throwing down those story elements again.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that sound even viable? I see it as a system that requires the players to be willing to see the awesome in taking some risks and planning out a really cool, edge of the seat game rather than a nice safe one. The trick would be the weaving of the different missions and the on-the-fly reworking of the plan. Or is it just madness induced by too much sun and cheap beer?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading<br/>\nNeil                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83712/#Comment_83712" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T16:31:42+00:00" title="July 27, 2007  4:31PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds neat, Neil, but I think you're traipsing on the very edges of the Czege Principle: "It's no fun to do your own adversity."  How can you loosen it up so that the players get surprised, and not everything always goes according to plan?  Perhaps they only pick half of the challenges, and the GM/Designated-Adversity creates the others?  Perhaps they make challenges for each other?  Basically, how can the players have <em>some</em> control but not <em>total</em> control over what they're facing off with?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83714/#Comment_83714" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T16:37:36+00:00" title="July 27, 2007  4:37PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, thats exactly the issue I came up with myself.

GM or player sets up basic objective (I could see this being GM for things the characters are ordered to do, players for things the characters decide to do on their own).<br>2.

The GM decides what the challenges will be to attain the objective (possibly revising as you go, based on events).<br><br>Have you looked at the way things go in <i>Beast Hunters</i>? It might be a good model to follow - much like as I have described, the player(s) decide the overall objective AND the difficulty, but the GM determines what the details of the challenges will be.

The players start the game with a planning scene, in which they lay out all the obstacles they need to accomplish to get the mission done. The GM then awards a number of points based on how hard they've made it for themselves. But the proviso is that the GM can twist things about once the mission kicks off, introducing adversity of his own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84052/#Comment_84052" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T09:42:58+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  9:42AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks better, Neil.
