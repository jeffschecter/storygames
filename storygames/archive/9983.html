One player has a ventrilo server set up already from her WoW days but the big missing piece is a suitable whiteboard. I've looked at Maptools and that seems overblown for our purposes and needlessly complicated...

There were some really irritating issues with people getting booted out, and synchronization. I'm not sure if those have been resolved. Just a heads up, otherwise, it's great. There are a few modules for SGs floating around out there.<br/><br/>Also, if you're into playing with new folks that you meet online, I'd suggest that you stick to one-shots until you guys get to know each other.

I never think to myself "oh sure, they'll only cut and paste for now but after a while they'll discover the other functions and love it!" It's just not true.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that it might help if I wrote down a series of features that my imaginary table-top application should have and see which ones hit those marks.

I should have said it right away but I was in a hurry: Vassal looks rather ugly out of the box, and overly complicated. But fear not! You don't need to do anything difficult, really. You don't need to know anything of programming even for creating modules, for the basic stuff.<br/><br/>You have to launch the webstart, or otherwise install the program, and then download one module: the <a href="http://www.vassalengine.org/community/index.php?option=com_vassal_modules&amp;task=display&amp;module_id=610" rel="nofollow">Bucket of Dice</a>. Click on "files" and then downoad the .mod file.<br/>That should be enough for most games (unless you need miniatures. In that case I'd suggest maptool instead).<br/><br/>My idea is to use Vassal only as a shared table, with no rules enforcing whatsoever, no turn tracking, nothing. It will only be there as a substitute of your table and dice.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(screenshots of my module, made based on the Bucket of Dice, coming soon)</span><br/><br/>Sorry for the huge image, it's on my double monitor; click to see the full size:<br/><br/><a href="http://s99.photobucket.com/albums/l313/renatoram/dryh/?action=view&amp;current=dryh_table.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Photobucket" src="http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l313/renatoram/dryh/dryh_table.png" style="border: 0px;" width="700"/></a><br/><br/>The module has dice in the 4 colors, coins, and a "table" to place them with the two bowls drawn directly on. When Pain dominates you simply drag one coin from the toolbox on the Despair Bowl.<br/><br/>There are also fancy moleskine character sheet that can be compiled using the text labels and the images from the toolbox (crosses, gray boxes to eliminate the responses you don't have, and so on) but in that regard Vassal is pretty clunky. I'd use a wiki, or something, to quickly compile the charsheets, and maybe later on use these taking my time to compile them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221703/#Comment_221703" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T13:25:29+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  1:25PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2009 1:33PM by renatoram.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I guess it's worth mentioning, I also made a 3:16 table and tokens for Maptool some time ago.

You can also select some of the dice on the table with your mouse and Clone them (with Ctrl-C) to speed up the process if you have some very large pool. <br/><br/>Then select the same way, Right-Click and choose "Roll" (or CTRL-R).<br/><br/>Should be all <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(yeah, I know, the GUI of Vassal is counterintuitive and rather ugly... but it works and has loads of boardgames/wargames for those interested...
