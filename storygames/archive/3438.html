Please keep in mind that none of these are rooted in actual play, but rather based on several readings of the document.<br/><br/>Without further ado...<br/><br/><b>p3 Distribute</b>\n<ul><li>The six NPC cards could be used as a scaling/pacing tool.<br/></li><li>Perhaps key it to the number of players?<br/></li><li>However, I mostly want to confirm that it is a fixed resource -- this many, no more<br/></li></ul>\n<b>p3 Discuss</b>\n<ul><li>This is mostly a confirmation question.  Brainstorming characters is the entirety of character generation, right?  If so, cool!  (I think...)<br/></li></ul>\n<b>p5 The lights go down</b>\n<ul><li>In the sentence "We'll take turns framing scenes.", who is <i>we</i>?  Just the players?  Players and GM?<br/></li><li>Do you have any thoughts on turn order (ie: Bob framed last time, so now it's Keira's turn)<br/></li></ul>\n<br/><b>p5 What's my motivation?</b>\n<ul><li>The third paragraph (begins with "If your charcter is about to...") essentially is describing free-form play, right?  There isn't a structure here?<br/></li><li>"Opposing" another player's goals is left entirely to the discretion of each participant?<br/></li><li>Can players request that the GM oppose another player?

Or when you get D &amp; C, does new stuff happen?<br/></li><li>When NPCs take Harm due to D&amp;C, do they take Harm at every stage, or just at the "last" stage?<br/></li></ul>\n<b>p10 You can't trust the infected</b>\n<ul><li>"Once per conflict, at any point during the conflict..."  This sentence implies that conflicts are multi-stepped (like Dogs) with individual actions withing the conflict.  If so, this is not made clear in the conflict resolution rules.<br/></li><li>However, if conflicts are resolved 'all in one go' (like PTA), then shouldn't this sentence read "Once per scene, at any point during the scene..."<br/></li></ul>\n<b>p11 Murder Death Kill</b>\n<ul><li>Observation: not framing an NPC into a scene is functionally equivalent to "...willy-nilly killing off...central NPCs."  This reinforces the importance of questions of framing authority raised under "Pens and swords...".<br/></li></ul>\nPatch 1<br/><b>Reaching for that goal</b>\n<ul><li>The use of "rolls" as opposed to "roll" once again implies that conflicts are multi-tiered.<br/></li><li>The Jason/Steve example implies that achieving stakes is a function of narration, not win/lose.  Is this true?  Is this true of all conflicts?  (Related to questions on "Resolving conflicts").<br/></li></ul>\nPatch 2<br/><b>The infection spreads</b>\n<ul><li>As an aside, I was one of the recipients of the pre-deletion patch.  IMHO, it is actually much clearer than the second version of Patch 2.  I'll append its text as an attachment.<br/></li><li>Is it possible for a given PC to increase their infection dice by more than one at a time?<br/></li></ul>\nAs you can see, there's a fair number of questions.  I don't necessarily think that you have to answer them all, but I certainly think that the questions about rights surrounding NPC-introduction (framing?) and multi-stage vs single-stage conflicts need addressing.  I'm looking forward to our first game!<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Darcy<br/><br/><br/><b>Patch 2 version 1</b><br/>Whenever infected dice are rolled in a conflict there is a chance that one or more of the players will gain an infected die, indicating that their character has either become infected or the infection they already have has become worse.<br/><br/>Any player, including the GM, who rolls a 1 on an infected die in the last round of a conflict must choose one PC to gain an infected die.  A player may choose either their own or someone else's PC, but they must choose a PC who was involved in the conflict.  Naturally, the GM doesn't have a PC to give an infected die to, so they must choose someone else's.<br/><br/>Each player chooses a maximum of one PC to assign one die to, no matter how many 1s they may have rolled in the last round of the conflict.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79881/#Comment_79881" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-06T12:50:52+00:00" title="July  6, 2007 12:50PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hiya Darcy,<br/><br/>Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you on this.  I plead both laziness and vacation.  And laziness stemming from vacation.  Lemmie see if I can answer all your questions to your satisfaction.<br/><br/><b>Distribute</b><br/><br/>The six cards is a fixed resource.  No matter how many players you have, there will be exactly six of those NPC cards to draw from.  There's been some concern from my playtesters over this.  A few folks have expressed the desire to scale the number of cards with the number of players (meaning more NPC cards for more players).  However, I'm pretty sure the fixed resource thing does exactly what I want it to do.  Now I just need to figure out how to express that awesomeness to the folks who are jittery about it.<br/><br/><b>Discuss</b><br/><br/>You're right.  This is the limit of pre-story character generation.  I think it's been super-awesome in play so far.  I don't think anyone who's playtested has disagreed yet.<br/><br/><b>The lights go down</b><br/><br/>The "we" is meant to refer to all of the players, including the GM.  I'll be sure to make that more clear in future versions.  <br/><br/>The turn-order for framing scenes was one of those things where I intentionally left out any rules and then neglected to point out that the lack of a rule was intentional.  It's simply inconsequential <i>to the system </i> who frames what scene.  Therefore, any friendly system you naturally come up with is perfectly cool.  Take turns.  Flip coins.  Draw for high card.  Or let the loudest person frame next.  It'll all work as well.<br/><br/><b>What's my motivation?</b><br/><br/>This is one of those sections that I <i>thought </i>was crystal clear, but has so far proven to be a big ol' stumbling block for my readers.  You're right, it's essentially free-form right up until you have a conflict.  And you have a conflict when one player's narration contradicts or threatens another player's narration.  I expect the game to go (somewhat) like this:<br/><br/>Player 1:  My character does stuff!<br/>Player 2:  My character prevents you from doing stuff!<br/>GM:  Roll dice, you monkeys!<br/><br/>I suspect examples in the text will make this all much more clear.  There will be examples in the future.<br/><br/><i>Can players request that the GM oppose another player? If so, how much of a contribution can they make to the GM's methodology?</i><br/><br/>Now that's real interesting.  It's a completely new question to me.  In short, the answers are "Yes" and "As much as the GM is willing to accept."  Does that answer your question, or should we go into more detail?<br/><br/>(more in a bit)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79895/#Comment_79895" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-06T13:30:06+00:00" title="July  6, 2007  1:30PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Pens &amp; swords and Central NPCs</b><br/><br/>No,<br/>No,<br/>No,<br/>and,<br/>No.<br/><br/><b>Resolving conflicts</b><br/><br/>Not really,<br/>and,<br/>Yes, mostly.<br/><br/><b>Desperate and Crazed</b><br/><br/>No retconning.

As a quibbling nit, it's more like Trollbabe than DitV.  But that's neither here nor there.  <br/><br/><b>Murder Death Kill</b><br/><br/>At first, I wasn't sure what you were talking about here.  Then I looked back at my copy of the main rules and I see it.  The issue is that I need a distinctly different label for "NPCs that are on cards" and "NPCs that are not on cards".  See, when I said "Central NPCs" I meant "NPCs who are on cards".  <br/><br/>Does that clear things up (temporarily)?<br/><br/><b>Reaching for that goal</b><br/><br/>I intended the stakes thing to be a function of narration.... which will almost always be regulated by conflict resolution.  Let's say that your character is about to do That Thing.  That Thing is what your character has been trying to do the entire film (find love, impress his father, drive a Ferrarri, etc).  If, when you announce that your character is doing That Thing, no one opposes you, then it's yours.  You win.  Sail off into the sunset and play the happy music.  But, since someone will almost certainly oppose you (like the GM, because that's kinda his job), winning That Thing will come down to winning the conflict.<br/><br/>You:  I finally got the keys to the Ferrarri, the key-code to the dealership, and killed off the Zombie Car Salesmen... I am so driving that car!<br/>GM:  Well, that's when you father pipes up about how his father was killed by a Nazi driving a Ferrarri.  He's gonna try to talk you out of it.  Because Ferrarris are evil.  Roll dice!<br/><br/>(not sure if I answered your question)<br/><br/><b>Patch 2</b><br/><br/>Really?  That was more clear than the second version?  Okies.  I totally take your word for it.<br/><br/>Let me know if I missed anything essential, or if you still have any concerns.  I've gone through this a bit faster than I probably should, as I'm killing time between flights.<br/><br/>-Eric                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80026/#Comment_80026" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-07T20:07:55+00:00" title="July  7, 2007  8:07PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Eric,<br/>\n<br/>\nOk.  Things make a lot more sense now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe <b>Murder Death Kill</b> rules only make sense in light of the fact that anyone can introduce an NPC (central or otherwise).  Without the clarification that <i>anyone</i> (including the GM) can introduce central NPCs to a scene, that left the players able to effectively "kill" a central NPC who was past their prime by agreeing not to introduce them into scenes any more.  However, that's all fine, now.  Cool beans!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm still a little in the weeds when you say that Conflict Resolution is multi-tiered.  I don't see it.  Set stakes, roll, resolve.  That looks like one step to me.  Alas, your <u>Trollbabe</u> reference does me zero good (never read it or played it).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I'm susupicious that what you're driving at is that the Desperate and Crazed rules <i>add</i> steps to resolution, so long as the players go that route.  Is that right?  Or is there some other way that conflicts play out over multiple rolls?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nDarcy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80231/#Comment_80231" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T10:18:49+00:00" title="July  9, 2007 10:18AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Darcy,<br><br>The Desperate and Crazed thing is exactly what I'm talking about.

When those rules just never got used, or even discussed, I ended up leaving them out.  This is one of those things that I'll probably end up covering with a blanket rule of some sort.  Which will probably boil down to; "Resolve it however your group thinks is fair, and no, the GM gets no special consideration."  It's been my experience that, during the course of either setting the scene or narrating out the scene, it becomes pretty clear who the NPC is helping or hurting.  Which then usually leads to clarity in which player should have the NPC's card in front of them.<br><br>-Eric                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81608/#Comment_81608" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T05:48:35+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  5:48AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rich,<br><br>Are you sure we're talking about the same game?  <br><br>-Eric                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81624/#Comment_81624" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T06:30:15+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  6:30AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Eric,<br/>\n<br/>\nThat clarifies just about everything, I think.  You're right -- the scene framing and (probably in many cases) the first few moments of free-play will establish what side everyone's going to be on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, on the topic of "introducing NPCs after the scene frame is complete", where does the authority lie?  Is it the same answer, "whatever your group thinks is cool"?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nDarcy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81677/#Comment_81677" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T09:22:49+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  9:22AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Darcy,<br><br>Yup, the 'whatever you think is cool' rule still applies here.  <br><br>If you do find yourself in a meta-conflict about who should be using which NPC (or any other kind of meta-conflict, really), then I'd like you to apply the rule that I wrote up for determining who is more Desperate or Crazed;  Let the GM decide.
