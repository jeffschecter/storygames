None of us had played it before. I apologize for the vague title, but I may have a number of different things to discuss and didn't want to limit the topics by being too specific.<br/><br/>I really liked how the game is super clear on what you're supposed to do at every given time. You have a bunch of "don'ts" to avoid, like straying off Focus or introducing something from the No column of the palette, but one don't is extra interesting to me: You're not supposed to have your character perceive anything about another main character in the scene. Secondary characters are fine. The text from the rules:\n<blockquote>Don\u2019t describe things you perceive about a character someone else is<br/>playing, unless it\u2019s a secondary character (someone introduced during the<br/>Scene, not picked during setup). That\u2019s for the other player to decide.</blockquote>\nAlso, when you read what you're allowed to Push for, you can push to change what someone else perceive, and you can introduce perception for another character, but you still can't push to perceive anything about them.<br/><br/>I've taken a bunch of impro theater classes, and one thing you're taught is to help create the other characters on stage by making declarations about them. It's not only allowed, but encouraged. If you're on stage with me and you say "What? Wine at 10 in the morning? You're an alcoholic!" you're giving me a gift, something I can use to move my character and the scene forward. By limiting yourselves to only allow the actor to decide things about their own character, you stifle creativity. One thing I really dislike in traditional RPG culture is the idea of total PC ownership, where a suggestion from the GM or other player of "A guy you owe money shows up to..." is blocked by "No way! My character would never borrow money from anyone!" If you'd do that on an impro stage that's blocking and very much frowned upon.<br/><br/>So in terms of a Microscope scene, you're not allowed to have your character perceive my character having wine at 10 o'clock. I get that you can't describe or push for things my character does or thinks, but perceiving feels like it's a bit less definite. You may perceive me drinking wine, but it turns out to be apple juice. Your perception is still valid, only incorrect.<br/><br/>The wine example is on the border between perceiving and describing action though, so I'll use an example from our game. There was a negotiation scene between opposing military leaders, with me as the mediator. I wanted to describe the uniforms of the two sides as that hadn't been established, but that would be perception of main characters that I'm not allowed to do, not even push for. So I kept shut and the uniforms were never described. I guess I could have worked around it by stating my character's thoughts ("The mediator thinks the blue uniforms of Atlantis with their gold details make them look very powerful"), but that is still perception and creation of details about another main character. If you allow thoughts of that nature, you may as well allow perception, as perception is equally likely to be incorrect and therefore negatable as thoughts.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what I think about this yet, which is why I'm still thinking about it. Perhaps I was too literal in my reading of the rules, which I doubt since they're very clear on what you can or can't do. Perhaps you should be allowed to push your own perception of other characters, as that gives the other player a chance to object? I don't see that use of pushing described in the rules text, but see other categories of pushing described in a way that seem exhaustive, which makes me think this is not an oversight but intended.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463301/#Comment_463301" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-12T23:26:04+00:00" title="May 12, 2017 11:26PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting question, Jonas.<br/><br/>For anyone who's wondering what the heck, that's "perceive" specifically in the sense of making something true in the world by describing seeing it i.e. asserting things and thus making them true. If I want to make a volcano erupt, I have to describe my character perceiving it happening, rather than narrating it from an authorial/abstract viewpoint.<br/><br/>In lots of games, I'd say questions are a much better tool than assertions. You could just ask the other player what their uniform looks like or what they are doing right now. It may seem harmless to say you see them doing something (like having a drink) or tell them they have red hair, but they might have their own ideas. It's also pretty reasonable just to negotiate something truly trivial, like "hey, could you be having a drink when I come in?" but it's still a question.<br/><br/>Unlike improv, during role-playing games we're free to talk out-of-character, ask questions and work out details, so it's a very different beast. <br/><br/>The scene rules of Microscope also take into account that during other parts of the game, each of us can unilaterally make whole cities rise and fall. In a scene we're supposed to be focusing on the smaller scale of what's happening, so the rules intentionally limit us. We can make big things happen if we need to, but there are constraints. Likewise even though our characters are completely temporary, the rules set boundaries of who can say what so players know what they're allowed to do, and it isn't just a question of who speaks first or loudest (which is the same as lots of games, really). If there's a clear line, you are free to be creative without wondering if you're stepping on someone else's toes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
