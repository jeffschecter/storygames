I suppose this stems from my visual impairment and thus my lack of enthusiasm for drawing up maps and using visual aids. However, this is something that the players are requesting, and fairly so. Are there any viable collaberative drawing tools that a group can all see and edit that I may be unaware of? Skype has a whiteboard application, but it doesn't appear it can be used for more than two people at once, so that's out. Any others I might not be aware of?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
