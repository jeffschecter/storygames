Is it basically familiar gameplay with different color?  Familiar procedure with different emotional tone?  Do the color or tone change the whole equation and reason to play, or not?<br/><br/>Would it be fun?  <i>Could</i> it be fun without being nasty and mean?  Is it harder for us to empathize with characters defined more by their flaws than by their strengths?  If so, is that fixable, and worth fixing?<br/><br/>I actually think the underdog struggle to triumph over one's shortcomings amidst truly external adversity (i.e. adversity you didn't sign up for by charging into a dark hole for treasure or something) should be pretty engaging.  I imagine there are plenty of RPGs which do something similar.  I guess the big unknown is the psychological impact of the mechanical and textual framing...?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455688/#Comment_455688" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-19T20:33:43+00:00" title="August 19, 2016  8:33PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2016 8:34PM by jangler.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fate does both sides of the coin, since your character's Aspects are all things that can be Invoked for positive effect by the player and Compelled for negative effect by the GM or by a different player. The "fate point economy" more or less ensures that you can't just exploit Aspects; you have to be willing to take some complications as well.\n<blockquote><i>Could</i> it be fun without being nasty and mean?</blockquote>\nYou're not forced to take a Compel in Fate, but you have to spend a fate point to veto a Compel that someone proposes. So you're never being entirely yanked around by your character's flaws (unless you're out of fate points?).<br/><br/>The Fate games I've played weren't much different in tone from D&amp;D, even though the mechanics are pretty different. I think in a setting-agnostic game the tone depends on players more than system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455689/#Comment_455689" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-19T21:13:32+00:00" title="August 19, 2016  9:13PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Penny For My Thoughts, you don't get to decide what you say or do, the other people at the table decide that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455692/#Comment_455692" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-19T21:21:51+00:00" title="August 19, 2016  9:21PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <b>When Bad Things Happen to Good Magicians</b>, the characters are inept fantasy heroes who spend the whole game passing the blame for their failures to each other and bickering about which of them was the worst.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455693/#Comment_455693" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-19T21:26:31+00:00" title="August 19, 2016  9:26PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Fate is just one of many games where your awesome character isn't perfect.  I don't see that as a significant departure from the standard paradigm.  I'm talking instead about a game where things like "clumsy" or "gun shy" or "asthmatic" or "skittish" are the core, maybe even the whole deal, and then such characters are faced with situations that'd benefit from dexterity or boldness or cardiovascular endurance.<br/><br/>When the clumsy character faces a lock that need to be picked, how is that different than the deadly character facing a hard-to-kill foe?

Character embodiment/identification tends to mean that we (players) strive as they (characters) strive.  When faced with problems, we want to do all we can to come out on top.  I think there are a few ways forward from that default:<br/><br/>a) Work with it.  The player does their best, using the character's limitations as constraint. <br/><br/>b) Ditch it and replace it.  When faced with a problem, choosing the worst possible approach is absolutely something that real people and fictional characters do.  It's just not a thing that game-players tend to do.  So, give players an incentive to play <i>this</i> game differently.  (Example: <i>Fiasco</i>.  More on that to come.)<br/><br/>c) Take it out of the players' hands entirely.  In situations of struggle, where you might succeed or fail, your character's behavior is entirely programmed reaction, and not at all your choice.

Hmm...</blockquote>\nI don't think <i>Fiasco</i> actually engages with weaknesses/flaws in any specific ways. It's, rather, a game where we look forward to seeing some things go wrong, so we are prepared to make them up. <br/><br/>That's a different process. We're not saying, "Hey, this character has these weaknesses, let's build a story around that." We're saying, "Hey, this story will have some bad things happen. Let's all collaborate to shape our characters' choices in that direction."<br/><br/>The Aftermath is the only part that really drives it home.<br/><br/>I think it's totally different from what you're describing.<br/><br/>I like the idea of a game where, kind of like in various OSR games, engaging the mechanics is a very, very unappealing thing. Simon's "Losers of the Apocalypse" was doing that, but perhaps to ham-fistedly. If you know that your character is likely to fail anytime they do X or Y, that might inspire some really creative roleplaying. Lots of potential here!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455735/#Comment_455735" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-23T00:23:14+00:00" title="August 23, 2016 12:23AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben,<br/><br/>That's cool.

I can see two possible ways of it going down:\n<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li> Players pick up a ton of flaws: poor eyesight, loss of hearing, crippled, afraid of spiders, acrophobia, etc. When they perform an action, they've got enough of these flaws that they hinder them in most every situation. Sum up the value of the flaws and they increase your TN. Players roll whatever and see if they can struggle past their flaws to accomplish something.</li>\n<li> Players pick up a ton of flaws: they autofail when confronting a flaw situation head-on. Their objective is to find a way past the obstacle without confronting it head on and thus engaging one of their flaws. </li></ul>\nSo which of these methods is more akin to what you were envisioning? I feel like the latter is probably the more appropriate approach. In either event, I think it would make for a great system for a horror game. Pretty much the kind of thing that would really heighten tension cause you're getting forced to survive in a situation where all of your flaws are kicking your ass. I could see the former option being a way to do the 0th lvl adventure. I would probably say, "hey you're gonna pick up a ton of flaws. Each flaw is reflective of the life you lead up until this point. So maybe you lost your hearing in a mining accident, but that means you do know some stuff about mining/geology. Might have been crippled in the war, so at least you know something about military tactics." etc. etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455756/#Comment_455756" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-23T19:09:42+00:00" title="August 23, 2016  7:09PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It could be interesting to combine flaws with "experiences".

Hmm...</blockquote>\nReading these comments my thoughts are that there is a fundamental between what you want to achieve, and what you then do to achieve it.<br/><br/>You say you want the underdog struggle.<br/>But the classic underdog struggle is all about <b>success</b>, although achieved in dramatic ways against "impossible" odds.<br/>Many of the games mentioned achieve exactly this... which doesn't sound fitting to you because your preference or at least your current focus (<b>seems to me, but maybe I'm wrong</b>) is all about player ability, character skill, system mastery.<br/><br/>You look at ways to make <span style="text-decoration: underline;">characters fail</span> in their tasks and actions as a way to have Players feel challenged, to force them to be creative and work around the limits imposed by the rules. Fundamentally you offer a puzzle to be solved.<br/><br/>But failure in and of itself does not translate into drama and tension, and in most cases the best drama comes out of "positive" intentions and results.<br/><br/>In <b>FIASCO</b> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">characters</span> always strive for success, and try to do the best with what they have.<br/>But because the dice mechanics make it impossible (or very difficult and far fetched) for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">player</span> to approach the game as a challenge, then victory/loss dynamics go out the window, which in turn encourages the players to have the story go wherever seems more fun... usually towards a beautiful disaster.<br/><br/><b>Prime Time Adventures</b> focuses hugely on the PROBLEMs of the protagonists, yet nothing forces the characters into the ground artificially. Yet, the story is dramatic and challenging, even though the characters (and players) have great agency power.<br/><br/><b>Polaris</b> is a tragedy that you know from the start will only end in grief and disaster; yet you play an incredibly powerful being.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>In general I'm also thinking about all the movies and series and books that I would gladly throw out the window when the protagonists just act like morons for no good reason.<br/>This kind of fiction often makes me think "<i>the writer is unskilled, he can't handle real drama so he creates tempests in teapots by forcing characters to act stupid, otherwise the story will end in 5 minutes because of some obvious/clever idea</i>".<br/>Sounds familiar? :P<br/><br/><b>Stranger Things</b> was AWESOME exactly because it managed to be the opposite of this. Everyone was smart and sensible; sure they were under emotional stress most of the time, and this prompted some less than ideal decisions here and there; but for the most part they were acting like they had a brain.<br/>And yet, because they were "<b>just normal people</b>" everything was a challenge, and filled with tension and drama.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Going back to Simon's "Losers of the Apocalypse"...<br/><br/>(where for me the most stunning thing about that thread was how it was summarily closed after he politely and reasonably asked for explanations and guidance. I don't know if there was any backchanneling involved, but from the outside it looked like a swift display of exceedingly PC moderation, which sadly seems to be a defining trait of parts of the current "indie" community in general, these days, but I digress)<br/><br/>...his design was ham fisted, for sure.<br/>But why?<br/>To me, it was because it outlined characters with no fighting chance, no redeeming qualities, no hope for improvement.<br/>You are crap because yes and you can never be anything other than crap, because crap is what you are. Now FEEL this and I hope you enjoy the experience.<br/><br/>I mean, a full playthrough with <b>My Life With Master</b> is, on many levels, a way to have the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">players</span> (through their PCs) endure a relatively strong psychological violence.<br/>But that is ok because the game focuses that negative experience towards a final release; it gives a purpose to the suffering, so it becomes a struggle instead; and however deep and dark the voyage might be, there is always a light (sort of) at the end of it.<br/>Plus, tons of techniques to put the players at ease and moderate the content... which is NEVER offered by the game itself. All the horror is summoned by the players themselves, and the rules only offer a structure to facilitate this.<br/>In a PbtA game each move "imposes" a specific fiction, as we have seen with the Losers playbooks, which amplifies the unsavory effect <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/><br/><br/><b>Gang Rape</b> (the jeepform game) is even harsher than this, but it is ok because the focus is clearly not about being a "loser", or even a "victim". Actually the fictional victim is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">player</span> in the safest and strongest position, while the aggressors are the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">players</span> experiencing the brunt of the game's psychological backlash in spite of (and really because of) their fictional position of strength and advantage.<br/>And again, all content is provided by the players, not by the game.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>So back to the original question: yes you can play an underdog... it works just like any other "hero game" reskinned to be more down to earth.<br/>Usually games aim for the drama of it, and you get Fiasco, Polaris, etc.<br/><br/>What you are looking for I think is more along the lines of Level Zero ORS games where the difficulty is cranked up but, for aesthetic purposes, instead of adding more dragons you hamper the characters... those games capture the underdog vibe relatively well, although the drama is pretty much lost in the numbers as usually focuses more on survival than personal drama; more on performance than personal struggle.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>As a final not, a game that explicitly uses rules to limit characters in such a way that "<i>if you do X you always fail</i>" is actually my horror game <b>Touched by Evil</b>.<br/><br/>In that game the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">players</span> get to experience nasty stuff like powerlessness and alienation thanks to how the mechanics work.<br/>Characters are normal people, and there is a LOT they can do, and the dice mechanics actually give them a helping hand and lots of agency.<br/>Except when it comes to a few specific things, that are fixed "because yes":<br/>- no one believes you, when you try to talk about the Evil and its Shadows<br/>- violence is never a solution against the Evil<br/>- (real) magic does not exist, except the Evil can defy the laws of reality<br/>- even if magic existed, it does not work on the Evil<br/>- the Evil is alien, it can not be understood or reasoned with<br/><br/>These rules basically take away from the players the most common "tools" used by any character in any story to achieve their goals and to feel agency. By selectively taking them away, the game lulls the players into a false sense of safety (<i>I can roll, I can act, I can succeed, business as usual</i>) and then hits hard in very specific and targeted ways.<br/><br/>The effect is much worse than the usual frustration present in an underdog story.

I quite enjoyed the demon-binding and demon-banishing rules which I never used in Sorcerer, because they established meaningful constraints for my character.  "Banishing a badass demon is not impossible, but it's REALLY HARD," is a setting truth that it can be fun to see reflected in the system.  And then, you know, if you actually try it, it had <i>better</i> be represented in the system.<br/><br/>I do think "<i>never</i> engage <i>any</i> mechanics" is probably not ideal, though.<br/><br/>Why are we assuming that the player gets a choice, though?  "Social stuff happens at you, roll your awful Social stat, see just how it goes wrong," is mechanical engagement, right?<br/><br/>Maybe the meaningful choices in play occur <i>after</i> the rolls rather than <i>before</i> them.<br/><br/>Maybe your crappy character's crappy attributes are really just situation generators.<br/><br/>The underdog story is about success, but only in a relative sense.  Winning the championship is optional.  Simply staying on your feet to the final end of the final fight might be victory enough.  Any time you did something it didn't seem like you could do, that's a success, no matter the scale, I think.  <br/><br/>Would I play a character who spends 5 sessions working up the nerve to call his ex-girlfriend?  Well, if it was clear why it was that difficult, and if making the call at the end actually felt like an achievement, then I dunno, I'd at least be tempted to try it.<br/><br/>How do we suck at everything but then achieve <i>any</i> sort of success?  Maybe that's all we really need to answer here?  Is it through grinding until you get that one lucky roll?  Is it through roleplay that convinces the GM or the group that this time is different?  Is it through a "lose to win" strategy that improves your stats each time you fail but survive?  Is it a tactical maze where you handle what you can handle first, to grant incremental boosts in subsequent endeavors, and maybe there's a Push Your Luck mechanic and a time limit?  <br/><br/>Is there a progress ladder to climb like in Kagematsu?  A diagram of unlockables like in Spellbound Kingdoms?<br/><br/>What are the rules about which failures break you vs strengthen you, and what feeds into those determinations?  What internal and external dynamics are at play, where getting better at one thing always makes you worse at another, but slightly better at a third, etc.?  Or do the rules not tell you at all when you grow and learn vs just collapsing, and that's all up to the player to inhabit the character and determine what feels authentic in the moment?  Or is there an element of both -- the player decides, but the rules determine some costs of those decisions?<br/><br/>I'll look over the specific points I've failed to address here and hopefully get back to some of those soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455884/#Comment_455884" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-29T17:32:46+00:00" title="August 29, 2016  5:32PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great brainstorm, Dave!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455899/#Comment_455899" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-30T02:41:11+00:00" title="August 30, 2016  2:41AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2016 3:04AM by Dirk.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me all of these insights and the lessons of Fiasco suggest the necessity to abandon any paradigm in which<br/><br/>(1) a player makes a suggestion or assertion about the fiction ("I jump over the chasm!")<br/>and then (2) has their assertion challenged by the structure or mechanics of the game (first you must roll dice, spend tokens, consult character stats, etc.)<br/><br/>In other words, a <i><b>character's failure</b></i> shouldn't coincide with the rejection of a <i><b>player's input</b>.</i><br/><br/>Fiasco does this nicely by prompting for the outcome a scene with enough time for the player to incorporate that outcome into their input.<br/><br/>Swords without master also does this similarly, though the dichotomy is shifted to a thematic polarity rather than success/failure, good/bad.<br/><br/>I guess in this way both SWM and Fiasco are using "luck (or choice) at the start" rather than "luck at the end" (D&amp;D) or "luck in the middle" (most pbta moves.)<br/><br/>I'm imagining a game now that's basically a hack of SWM, but each character has their own set of thematic polarities, or maybe even a plethora of them. A hypothetical character might have a die for drunkenness, a die for despair and a die for heroism. At the start of a scene or "conflict" (how ambiguous) roll the dice and play to the result. Could maybe even admix the two highest dice. What does the "despair and heroism" result look like? "Drunkenness and heroism?" 'Drunkenness and despair?"<br/><br/>All three dice showing the same number results in a moment of wholeness and clarity, an escape from your prescriptive notions of self.

Lemme try again, with that inspiration guiding me:<br/>- melee attacks<br/>- missile attacks<br/>- being distracted, or losing track of someone or something<br/>- being physically outmaneuvered -- snared, cornered, trapped, flanked, surrounded<br/>- being outmaneuvered in terms of power and leverage -- coerced, blackmailed, etc.<br/>- being outperformed in a contest -- out-run, out-fenced, out-sung, etc.<br/>- ambushes and surprise attacks<br/>- being robbed<br/>- being conned or seduced, or believing lies<br/>- uneven deals or bargains<br/>- being physically destroyed, like by fire or acid<br/><br/>Some of those are more or less participatory than others.

So, Paul, "Do I spend XP now to succeed, or do I spend them later to improve?"  Interesting.  Suggests that we learn from failure, which is cool, but will fit some situations better than others.<br/><br/>Some musings:<br/><br/>Being bad at something can be neutral.  Or it can cause despair and lack of effort and zero progress ever.  But, if you <i>have</i> to deal with it, over time you'll either get better or develop some sort of dysfunctional coping mechanism.<br/><br/>So, maybe if you spend your XP in the moment, that doesn't mean you succeed at the immediate task you're bad at; instead, it means you succeed in your overall aim somehow, by either avoiding the task you're bad at or rendering your failure irrelevant.  Depending on your aim and the situation and what skills and habits you have, this circumventing can either be harmless or quite harmful.  If you succeed by doing something that's bad news in the longer term, maybe the XP cost increases.<br/><br/>If you <i>don't</i> spend XP in the moment, and just fail the task <i>and</i> don't get what you want, then you may or may not have learned anything from that.  Each point of XP becomes a die which is rolled, perhaps modified by the situation and whether you really even tried.  Good rolls, you improve at the thing you're bad at.  Bad rolls, no such luck.<br/><br/>This kinda mirrors real life, where it's tempting to take shortcuts and learn nothing, because the reward is more immediate and more guaranteed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456009/#Comment_456009" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-04T00:25:31+00:00" title="September  4, 2016 12:25AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2016 12:26AM by David_Berg.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>in an inversion of a capable adventurer story, how do you make experience points valuable?

It's a cool option, but there should be others.<br/><br/>Honestly, I might be tempted to do the exact opposite of your XP idea, and say that contributing to larger goals or investments gives you back <i>at least</i> what you put in.  There'd be delay and uncertainty, though (maybe the villagers don't acknowledge your help! maybe the village gets flooded!) so "just be an altruist" wouldn't be a clear or easy path.<br/><br/>Actually, I wonder, this might make more sense for something like "energy" than for XP...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
