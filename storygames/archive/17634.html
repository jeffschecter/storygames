It wasn't until I discovered indie games that I really learned how sandbox play was supposed to work (beginning perhaps with Dogs in the Vineyard and My Life With Master, though MLWM has a pretty constrained sandbox), and that the GM was essentially just another player at the table, albeit one with somewhat different responsibilities. The ramifications of all of that are things I'm still dealing with (and they also apply to GM-less play, where the "just another player" thing is strongly reinforced).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pksullivan" title="pksullivan"><img alt="pksullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pksullivan">pksullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399431/#Comment_399431" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-03T09:21:25+00:00" title="December  3, 2012  9:21AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was a sometime GM in college but my group fell apart as people graduated or moved away sometime around 2005 or 2006. In 2008 I was going through serious game withdrawal for not having played in a few years so I put up an advert at my FLGS for D&amp;D 4e players. It was the new hotness and you can always get people to play D&amp;D even if you don't know people interested in other games. We've been a regular RPG group ever since. <br/><br/>My biggest challenge as a GM was to transition out of that D&amp;D and into different systems. 4e, while relatively low-prep compared to other D&amp;D systems, was still very time consuming. I managed to convince my players to let me GM a short campaign of Dresden Files, which I felt more fully supported improvisational GMing and character-driven stories. Gently encouraging the players to take the reins of the story and direct it where they want it to go was incredibly challenging. Even though I tried to weave character story arcs into our D&amp;D game, most of my players were very much of the mind that they were at the table to experience the story I was telling. It turned out that I needed to convince them that I wasn't the one with the story to be told; it was them and their characters. I am merely the foil and the person who gives them the opportunity to be awesome. Part of my solution was to spend more time in character as the various NPCs. In many ways, the table follows my lead. If I am in character, then the rest of the table will bring their characters to life. But if I don't then the role play falls flat. It's up to me to set the tone of the session.<br/><br/>They eventually got it and our campaigns have been much different since then, more vibrantly inhabited and richly detailed. The Dresden Files campaign was character focused. Our follow up Spirit of the Century campaign was, too. I took a bit of a break as GM and one of the players ran a Serenity campaign that was a lot of fun. Our current Marvel Heroic campaign has explored my players' characters in ways that our early games did not.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399432/#Comment_399432" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-03T09:54:29+00:00" title="December  3, 2012  9:54AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Realising 1 hour in to a 4 hour Unknown Armies convention slot that the game was crashing and burning (I'd made the 'good guys' too weird for the PC's to see any reason to work with them so they just did what the powerful 'bad guys' demanded of them and derailed the plot) and bringing it back by stepping through the next 6 months of game time 1 interesting thing at a time which grew the threat of the 'bad guys' to a point where doing the weird crap that was needed to defeat them became the logical thing to do. <br/><br/>Then the PC's all got together at a secret location, the character who'd burnt the spell requirements on webcam admitted he'd taken a photocopy first and they set to robbing graves and ruining peoples reputations.

People always overlook how hard it can be to keep a group of close friends on topic! <br/><br/>One of the most important things a GM does in games that have one, is to act like a forum moderator and stop the game from getting de-railed. Part of that is shining the spot light around as well, to make sure every player gets their moment to shine. It's one the biggest challenges in my view, when I look around the table and realise that one player hasn't been in scene for awhile. <br/><br/>One reason I sometimes prefer games with GMs is that you have someone who is responsible for pace and tone. If you're in a GM'ed game and it starts to lag its the GM's responsibility to pick up the pace and eject some energy into the game, seriously you play with someone who can do that well and your experience of playing is massively improved.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399437/#Comment_399437" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-03T10:06:52+00:00" title="December  3, 2012 10:06AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2012 10:08AM by Rickard.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to improvise a lot, and sometimes let the players share the authority. I had no idea where the story would go. But I'm a people person, and can read them quite easily. So I could still do prep where I predicted how some of my players would react. I could create prewritten characters and write a word on the backside that hinted something about the character. By doing this, the players felt they had control over how they choose the characters but I knew who was going to choose which character. That's one difficult trick that I can pull off: where the players tries to surprise me, and I'm prepared because I know how they work.<br/><br/>Another thing that was difficult was to relearn was my love for the hobby. I GMd so much and did so much improvisation that I burned out. I held up for a half year, my mind went heavy just from thinking of playing roleplaying games. I made it back by going back to scratch. Starting to do prep and do prep the right way, so I could still incorporate the players ideas. I hardly GM nowadays without doing any kind of preparation, but compared to ten years ago - when it took me 3-18 hours to write a scenario - I can now come up with a functional adventure in less than an hour, because if some structures that saves me a lot of time. I've also realized that a session doesn't have to be six hours long to be OK. It actually works to play for just one or at most two hours, and manage to finish the whole scenario.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399438/#Comment_399438" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-03T10:14:18+00:00" title="December  3, 2012 10:14AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2012 10:18AM by Colinaut.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>I should note my experiences here come from a long absence from RPG. Played/GMed a lot in high school and college and after years am back and have fallen in love with the indie games.</i><br/><br/>My biggest challenge as a GM has always been having too many players. Never had a satisfactory game with groups larger than 5 as its hard to keep everyone involved so I avoid having groups that big. Though that's just logistical so not an exciting answer. <br/><br/>My second biggest challenge and one that I embrace and like to get better at is horror. Building the tension to get that horror right can be hard. Too often, no matter how many teeth or tentacles it has, it just becomes another thing with hit points. I first got the bug for GMing horror way back in high school when I GMed the game Chill. We played in the basement in low light next to the big steam boiler that heated the house. It set a great mood as the boiler made odd sounds. My one friend said he had nightmares after one particularly great game session involving evil child-like creatures. I can't say my horror games are all that good but I strive to make them so. Had a few really disturbing games of Kult I ran too\u2026 I have yet to run a game using Dread but it's on my list.<br/><br/>I also like to run more heroic style play. I GMed a lot of Top Secret and TORG and Vampire back in the day (really when you think about it Vampire is just emo superheroes). With heroic stories, no matter how hard the fight at the end of the day the characters will always live\u2014this of course doesn't mean they haven't lost something important to them. Finding that balance between making players fear the enemy and become anxious for their characters lives and not actually killing their characters is a fine line. There were numerous times I've altered a GM dice role just to make sure a character wouldn't die. I never felt happy doing that. This is one of the reasons I have fallen in love with indie games, especially the ones like AW and Lacuna where the GM never rolls dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399497/#Comment_399497" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-03T17:58:08+00:00" title="December  3, 2012  5:58PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zelbinian, a thousand thanks to you dude. Your comment made me realize an important piece I was missing on my design: a mechanic that could help the GM improvise consequences in response to players actions. It's of course something every GM does but whenever you focus on it, things really start to fly in the game.<br/><br/>A year ago I was about to ruin a whole campaign that started with the premise that the PCs were fugitives accused of a crime they didn't remember anything about. It started good but it was almost going old, when in the middle of a dungeon the players decided to fight back and create their own religious group from the ashes of a group they had just defeated. I instantly kicked the old premise and helped them create an army of fanatics, suddenly escalating the fight into a worldwide conflict. It was a medieval fantasy setting, but it somehow ended with a nuclear apocalypse and an event that wiped all magic and the PCs from the plane. Ah, good times...<br/><br/>J_Walton, I found out that pre-planned bangs and events are the way to go and having them at hand whenever that players feel lost or without a clear goal really makes them worth using. Of course, it's all <i>ala</i> DitV: as a GM all we have to do is propose a problem, not a solution; that's the player's fun. Then we just have to come up with the consequences to those actions. And it's a lot better when those consequences take their time to come back and bite players in the butt, when they least expect them.<br/><br/>Pksullivan, I really want to play like that too... a couple of the members of my group make it really difficult, but then again the rest of the time they roleplay it good and are nice pals, so it's us instead who have adapted to their way of playing. It's kinda funny that part of our fun is to watch how these guys dig their own graves through all the campaign. So I'd say that a big part of the challenge for me and the other couple of guys who had GMed was to be prepared against these door-kicking powergamers.<br/><br/>w00hoo, well, I admit that outsmarting the players into following a certain course of action is one of th hardest tricks to pull, specially with people that you don't know. It's  usually that way that a good rollercoaster ends up becoming a silly railroad, and the reason I no longer do too much prep ahead... which ends up making GM a work I can no longer do properly. But then again that's the main reason why I'm working in low-prep games that get the best out of the players and GM. But heck I do miss outsmarting the players...<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399498/#Comment_399498" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-03T18:28:46+00:00" title="December  3, 2012  6:28PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right now?

It's  usually that way that a good rollercoaster ends up becoming a silly railroad, and the reason I no longer do too much prep ahead... which ends up making GM a work I can no longer do properly. But then again that's the main reason why I'm working in low-prep games that get the best out of the players and GM. But heck I do miss outsmarting the players...<br/></blockquote>\nInteresting, I never really considered it as outsmarting the players, more digging myself out of a very deep hole as these people had committed time and money at the Con to play the game I'd offered (it was a ticketed event).<br/><br/>The main problem was the game was 'very ordinary people get confronted with a very extraordinary task and need to cope' written because I really liked the way magical rituals were just so bizarre in Unknown Armies and wanted to explore one in a one shot but they aren't really designed for that sort of play. As mentioned, the problem was I hadn't expected the ordinary people to just go 'yeah, too much for us' and punch the emergency exit button. I modified the way the threat worked for the second run and it was a lot better. Serves me right for basing a game on walking through a big box storage facility and thinking 'hey, the motion sensor lights in this maze of corridors are really quite unsettling'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399527/#Comment_399527" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T07:10:44+00:00" title="December  4, 2012  7:10AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's quite a different issue: Throwing a problem to the players only to find out they feel it's too big.

Hoping to be helpful, my character asked if our employer had any questions for the aspect. <br/><br/>In essence, I told the GM to ask himself a question and then answer it with mysterious portent.
