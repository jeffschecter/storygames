Prefer this random as well.<br/>4) Has an alarm or other notice that time is up, preferably not-too-oibnoxious.<br/><br/>Anybody know off someting like that?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307877/#Comment_307877" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T06:48:33+00:00" title="January 12, 2011  6:48AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're willing to spend about twenty bucks, the party game <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Buffalo-Games-180-Last-Word/dp/B0007W05SS" rel="nofollow">Last Word</a> comes with a randomized timer with a typical game show buzzer sound.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307881/#Comment_307881" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T07:44:22+00:00" title="January 12, 2011  7:44AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm positive there is. I found a program once that would chime at random intervals. It was a "mindfulness timer" or something like that. I was looking for something to time my meditation and came across it. The idea was that it would chime throughout the day at random times to remember you to focus your mind or whatever. I don't remember what the name of it is though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
