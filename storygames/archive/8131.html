I've decided its unlikely that a non-WoD or D&amp;D game will get traction, so I'm shooting for a game of D&amp;D combined with a bunch of ideas from Lost, the series. I'd like to get some commentary as I go through the process setting up ideas for the game:<br/><br/>For starters, in this game, the world as a whole is completely normal medievial world, humans only, no-overt magic, but the characters are ship-wrecked in an Island that permeates D&amp;Dness (Many of the characters are turned into demi-humans, bullshit monsters roam the land, magic suddenly 'works', the strewn about cargo is gifted with magical powers.)<br/><br/>I'm totally using lego minis for this.<br/><br/>I'm a little bit curious if there are obvious D&amp;D methods to escape the island - Wizard spells, for example. I'll have to think of some way to make that interesting and challenging when it comes up.<br/><br/>I'm using a hack from the Mountain Witch I wanted to try out: After meeting characters, NPC or PC alike, you can put points of Trust in them. These points of Trust can be used with special "Alliance" powers, which are taken off of Defender abilities based around direct help and Leader abilities based on cooperation. They can also be sacrificed for "Manipulator" powers, which are largely taken from the Rogue abilities, but suped up according to how many Trust points are burnt.<br/><br/>Which also puts in reasons to throw Dark Secrets in, which are very appropiate. <br/><br/>I'd like to throw in Flashbacks in a big way, something like, player sets up a situation in flashback and GM takes it from there, make it interface with the rules for Dark Secrets somehow - Flashbacks have to precede Director Authority? If someone has a more concrete idea, I'm all ears.<br/><br/>I'm also wondering whether to implement an "Others" like situation - At the simplest level, the Others are kind of fun, but at the same time, it might be hewing too close to the events of the series, as well as the fact that they can represent some of the cringe-worthy aspects of trad gaming foes (I planned you to react that paticular way to my actions!)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178941/#Comment_178941" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T04:55:29+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  4:55AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2008 4:56AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds more like <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2235" rel="nofollow">The Tempest</a>, which is a well you can return to many, many times for inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178945/#Comment_178945" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T06:11:41+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  6:11AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Trust mechanics are awfully interesting. This might be crossing lines for your players, but perhaps you should be able to buy Trust in PCs, too. It'd be interesting to mechanically buy off in-game suspicion, even as player tensions mount. Certain actions against characters might be simply impossible if they buy enough Trust. If everyone buys in, it'd be fun to see those alliances warp and change through play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179059/#Comment_179059" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T22:45:49+00:00" title="November 17, 2008 10:45PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As to wizard spells escaping- depends on edition. In 3e that stuff is all over the place, and might be very hard to avoid from as early as level 9. However, in 4e (which might be a bit of a disconnect with tactical battles and tons of healing vs. stuck on an island) that stuff is only available through rituals, which can be much more easily denied to players if it would cause a problem. Anyways, sounds pretty cool. Good luck with the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179166/#Comment_179166" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T12:10:24+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 12:10PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whiteknife's basically right about the magic being used to escape the Island: in 3rd ed or before the wizard would just Teleport everyone home.

At the end, we learn the answer to the question, and the PC either gets XP for the challenge and some small bonus or they get a quest to achieve later in the game.  It works really well, so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179193/#Comment_179193" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T13:29:13+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  1:29PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An idea: instead of action points, a player gets an extra die whenever they narrate a short scene in which they explain how the situation is eerily similar to a previous life experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179355/#Comment_179355" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T14:03:47+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  2:03PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite>Whiteknife's basically right about the magic being used to escape the Island: in 3rd ed or before the wizard would just Teleport everyone home.</blockquote>\nThat's as simple as to use some arcane type of ward against magical teleportation and a massive plannar anchor effect all over the island.<br/><br/>And you can even say it is in the rules! In fact, there is even a precedent. In Forgotten Realms, teleport spells don't work/are too dangerous to use when within the Underdark.<br/><br/>So, going for the "Lost" style, I'd say there is a misterious magical radiation at the island, that makes all attempts at teleporting unavailable. And common (very high level) monsters can block people's attempts at using more mundane methods.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179360/#Comment_179360" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T14:26:49+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  2:26PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you've also got this mysterious magical island in the middle of a normal, non-magical world.<br/><br/>Who says anything magical can be taken off the island?<br/><br/>I don't think players will be too shocked if they discover that trying to leave the island through magic simply doesn't work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
