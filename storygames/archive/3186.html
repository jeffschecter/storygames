First, I get myself in the mindset to expect that their contributions <i>will</i> contain nuggets of raw awesome coolness.  Then, in that mindset, I dig around mentally until I find those nuggets, pull them out, polish them and applaud them.  I come at things from an angle that will make it easier to do that.  And so on, and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider this set of skills, at this point, pretty fundamental.  I believe they are among the most important skills that an RPG player can learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut recently, I find myself questioning:  Should you <b>always</b> be using these skills?  Do you have a moral <b>obligation</b> to make somebody cool if you can, no matter the effort involved?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the benefits.  I know how much it improves the game, I know how much it enhances the camaraderie at the table.  It is a large, but not <i>infinite</i> amount.  It would take a really serious cost in effort and spent time in order to make me think that it's not worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I've also encountered players (mostly, it must be confessed, at conventions) who I think, in retrospect, were not worth the effort.  I spent time making them cool that I could have been spending more productively on making other players cool, or on being cool myself.  From the viewpoint of purely "How good would the game have been?" I made an objective mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there's my question, really:  If I have a choice between:<br/>\n(a) saying (more politely, but still) "No dude, you <i>suck</i>, and your imagination sucks, and until you prove otherwise I'm not going to bother trying to make you cool" and having a NOTABLY BETTER GAME (even after including them feeling like the suck) vs.<br/>\n(b) spending my effort to make a desperately boring person as marginally cool as they can be, and having a NOTABLY WORSE GAME (even after including all the factors about how much better they feel, and how much happier people are at the table)<br/>\n<br/>\n... am I morally obligated to choose (a)?  Or is this some Geek Fallacy, writ large?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72648/#Comment_72648" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T09:13:50+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  9:13AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2007 9:15AM by Graham.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, that's interesting.

Often, you don't want to play with people, because they suck but<br>3. Sometimes people who you think suck don't actually suck, they're just inexperienced and<br>4. Because they're unfamiliar with how to do it, they're often surprising and exhilirating to play with and<br>5. You might also enjoy <i>educating</i> them into doing it right but<br>6.

When I play at cons, and especially when I run games at cons, I am there to play with people I don't usually play with.  The focus is not really on the game, it's on the players.  So at convention, yeah, I'm all about digging around to get that nugget of awesome, even when building up the single player's contribution means a net loss of quality for the game as a whole.<br><br/>In my regular gaming, though, I am really fucking picky on players and rather mercenary on what gets the most attention.  There, the game is the thing, and generally speaking the players don't <em>need</em> the extensive digging around to get to the gold: they're selected beforehand to not need a bloody intervention in order to bring the awesome.<br/><br/>So for me at least, it boils down to what kind of experience I'm after <em>at that specific game</em>.  Sometimes it's worth making everybody at the table awesome; sometimes everybody at the table is there to make the game awesome.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72659/#Comment_72659" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T09:48:20+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  9:48AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>am I morally obligated to choose (a)?

For me, this most often manifests as unexpected synergy between players, a moment where you jointly produce something far better than either of you could have planned.  I think one of the best things you can do to make this happen is to look for it.  This isn't necessarily a great effort.  Sometimes it is just a matter of expecting to see it, adopting the attitude Tony expresses.<br/><br/>I don't find there to be anything inherently wrong about being selective in where you look, but I do think it should be balanced out by the realization that a lot of the cool in gaming comes when you least expect it.<br/><br/>As an aside, I had to laugh a bit at this topic.  As someone who games with Tony, I have on (considerably) more than one occasion inadvertantly done something that triggers Tony to run at full speed, like I was in some sort of relay race I didn't even know existed.  Sometimes I don't even know what I did *after* the fact.  Then when Tony, with his typical generosity of spirit, credits me with all the cool, I'm left to stammer "Um.  Er.  Yeah....Go me!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72727/#Comment_72727" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T12:58:30+00:00" title="May 30, 2007 12:58PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>So there's my question, really: If I have a choice between:</p>\n<p>(a) saying (more politely, but still) "No dude, you suck, and your imagination sucks, and until you prove otherwise I'm not going to bother trying to make you cool" and having a NOTABLY BETTER GAME (even after including them feeling like the suck) vs.</p>\n<p>(b) spending my effort to make a desperately boring person as marginally cool as they can be, and having a NOTABLY WORSE GAME (even after including all the factors about how much better they feel, and how much happier people are at the table)</p>\n<p>... am I morally obligated to choose (a)?
