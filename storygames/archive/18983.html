But before I get to the details of that, there are the groups people whose GameStorm experience I'm considering:<br/><br/>-The people running the games.<br/>-The people playing in those games.<br/>-The people who are new to these games.<br/><br/>I'd also like to point out that the people running the games tend to be community insiders who are already well established in this crowd.<br/><br/>I think each of those groups has different needs to one degree or another.<br/><br/>The basic format of Indie Hurricane breaks down into three gaming slots: Morning (3 hours), Afternoon (4 hours), and Evening (4 hours), with hour long meal breaks in between. That much probably won't change.<br/><br/>Here is what we have been doing:<br/>Morning - pre-scheduled games<br/>Afternoon - pre-scheduled games and open play pitch circle<br/>Evening - pre-scheduled games and open play pitch circle<br/>Panels - ??? (sometimes we have 'em, sometimes we don't)<br/>Special Events - do their own thing regardless of the rest of the schedule<br/><br/>(The open gaming pitch circle is a less formal thing, where a handful of people pitch games they'd like to run, and the big group of players pitch which game they'd like to play based on the pitches made.)<br/><br/>We have had a great time with that over the past years! But, I notice a few things here. This set up is best for the people running games, because they basically get to do whatever they want. This is significantly less good for those playing games, because we leave them to choose between the security of the pre-scheduled games and the selection of the pitch circle. Many IH participants have expressed a kind of "buyer's remorse" on account of that choice, and that has been my experience too (doubly so when it seems like the hot new playtests wind up being pitched instead of scheduled). Someone new to this would probably wind up in the pitch circle on account of the selection. Panels have been hit an miss for IH, partly because we talk about our gaming thoughts all the time, and partly because you often finding yourself choosing between playing a game for a few hours or attending a panel for only one hour. Finally, we have the booth in the deals room, where we have some locally made indie games for sale. Pretty cool for those in the know, but a little mysterious for those not in the know.<br/><br/>To summarize, this set up is best for people running games who are also established members of the community. It's okay for those playing the games, but only partially accessible to those who are new (which means they are both unfamiliar with these games and are community outsiders).<br/><br/>I would like to make things a little bit more even. So here is what I've been toying with.<br/><br/>Mornings: Panel + "Speed Dating"<br/>Afternoon: Open Gaming Pitch Circle. No Pre-Scheduled Games.<br/>Evening: Pre-Scheduled Games. No Pitch Circle.<br/>Night: Socializing in the Lounge.<br/>Special Event: Big giant Nordic Freeform for like 30 people in a Morning slot.<br/><br/>Some of this needs explaining.<br/><br/>Speed Dating: Demo four games in two hours (30 min each). Four local designers run their own games that are for sale in the IH booth. Twelve players or so split into four groups and rotate through those demos.  This is great for advertising games that may be unknown to people not in the loop, with a low time commitment, and trying lots of things very quickly. It will probably assist with sales, it's accessible to new people, and you can also attend the panel. But, it's may not have much to offer well established individuals, and it may be kind of a pain for the people running those demos back to back. Let me re-emphasize with this option one no longer needs to choose between attending a panel and playing a game.<br/><br/>Socializing in the Lounge: This is still in the works, but we may have a big ol' space with food and drink (I'm hoping to get alcohol happening here) where we can hang out on site. This would be a great place to have those awesome convention conversations, GameStorm staff/volunteers could attend more easily, and there is no coordination required (games all end at different times, different groups go to different places, etc.).<br/><br/>And of course, what I expect may the the most controversial point, is separating out the pre-scheduled games and the open gaming pitch circle. My aim with this is to not leave anyone feeling like they made "the wrong" choice with their IH experience. However, this is less ideal for, say, out-of-towners who maybe don't know until very late when they will be attending, and may be banking on the flexibility we've had in years past. Another option may be to just didtch pre-registered games all together, and just be awesome about announcing what is on the pitch circle menu in advance.<br/><br/>I want to talk panels, and how we can make it worth it for us, but I think I'll save that topic for a little later.<br/><br/>One more announcement:  (unless disaster intervenes) our Indie Hurricane Special Guest this year is Paul Czege! So excited!<br/><br/>So what do you think about all of this? I want to keep the flexibility and "improv-like" nature of IH, but making this event accessible for indie-curious folks and people who do not benefit from being an indie-insider is very important to me as well. I totally want to hear from people who have attended GameStorm/IH in the past, those who have considered attending but haven't, and those who intend to attend in the future, those who have attended gaming conventions in general, and everybody.<br/><br/>Thank you all so much!<br/><br/>Tayler<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424310/#Comment_424310" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T21:01:10+00:00" title="November 16, 2013  9:01PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking only for myself: I don't sign up in advance to run games, because I don't know if I'll actually make it to Gamestorm until I'm there.  So I like the 4-hour pitch circles, and having 3 hour morning slots is great because I can sleep in instead. But there are lots of games I could run, so if there some way for players to say what they wanted to play, in a sort of reverse pitch circle, I'd be happy to make that happen for them (if it's a game I can run). That's a lot trickier than GMs/Facilitators pitch, players choose, and I don't know how feasible it would be to do players request, GMs/Facilitators enable.<br/><br/>If Indie Hurricane only had one slot per day for open gaming I'd probably have to think hard about whether to attend at all, but if that works better for IH as a whole I'm OK with that.<br/><br/>Maybe something like the Gen Con / Origins "Games on Demand" where people can see ahead of time what's being offered?  Or an "Intro to Indie Games" track for newcomers who want to play Monsterhearts or whatever, for the first time?<br/><br/>I do like the idea of a lounge to hang out and talk gaming. Doesn't that already happen in the lobby and bar? But even more so, would be pleasing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/quincunx" title="quincunx"><img alt="quincunx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/quincunx">quincunx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424315/#Comment_424315" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T22:28:54+00:00" title="November 16, 2013 10:28PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The more I think about it, the more I like the idea of announcing pitch circle games in advance, and just being really on top of keeping those lists updated.

It's free, it's also and the Vancouver Hilton, so if you are in the area, you should check it out!<br/><br/>I'm told that they expect to have the scheduling system for the main convention up and running on that day. So please begin thinking about what you want to play!<br/><br/>If we have a panel, it's going to be Friday at 10am. I anticipate difficulty in getting them to program a meaningful topic for us, so if they can't/won't do that, I'm just going to bag the idea of doing a panel. We don't need a panel in order for us to have those conversations, anyway.<br/><br/>The pitch circles are the meat and potatoes of Indie Hurricane, and I'm going to insist that we have an up-to-date list of what is going to be offered in each slot.

I often choose what I'm going to run at the last minute, based on how I'm feeling and what else is going on.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm really used to the combined 4-5 methods that we tend to use at indie events in the PacificNW:<br/><br/>1. Pre-reg before the con<br/>2. Sign-up on sheets of paper at the con<br/>3. Pitch circle<br/>4. The Donut (which we use at GoPlayNW and less at Gamestorm)<br/>5. Pitch/Donut organizers facilitate a game for anyone left out<br/><br/>That seems totally normal to me now, but I understand if it's a bit confusing to people coming and expecting a standard con experience. But what we have to offer is explicitly NOT the standard con experience, but something better!<br/><br/>An important thing to remember, though: it's critical that the people volunteering their time (and money) to organize most of the games (1) feel comfortable, (2) feel supported, and (3) have a good time, because otherwise the Indie Hurricane is less of a success and fewer people will want to spend their limited time and funds to attend next year. Right now, every year I've been at GameStorm has been better than the last (and I pretty much only participate in the Indie Hurricane), but if I go and have a less good time, I may think twice about making the effort to come the next year.<br/><br/>Essentially: by all mean please help us think better about newcomers and those not yet plugged in, but let's not sabatoge the great community and experience we've created in an attempt to seek out a larger following. Honestly, the Indie Hurricane at GameStorm already feels close the maximum size it can be to operate in the same space that they've assigned to us for the last two years. If it gets bigger, we'll need a bigger space to run it too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/quincunx" title="quincunx"><img alt="quincunx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/quincunx">quincunx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426714/#Comment_426714" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T17:58:39+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  5:58PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey <a href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">@J_Walton</a>,<br/><br/>Totally, I hear you!

I love the spontaneity of our scene.  I love how people can just show up at the time of the pitch circle and be efficiently provided with a game. I love how I don't have to choose what I'm going to run weeks or even hours in advance. <br/><br/>I'm definitely not a fan of limiting pitch circles to one slot a day.  If you're looking to attract new folks I think it's easier to say "show up here at this time and we can almost guarantee you'll get into some game" rather than "please sign up weeks in advance for a game that you've never heard of."  I think fewer pitch circles mean fewer opportunities to incorporate new people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426748/#Comment_426748" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T23:15:23+00:00" title="January  6, 2014 11:15PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm subscribing to Johnzo's newsletter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/quincunx" title="quincunx"><img alt="quincunx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/quincunx">quincunx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426749/#Comment_426749" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T23:17:10+00:00" title="January  6, 2014 11:17PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Either I wasn't clear, or it just got lost, but there isn't going to be just one pitch circle a day. That idea was a left over from some early discussions I was having with my ex-co-organizer, and after talking about it with a few folks, and reading comments here, I don't buy the logic for it anymore.<br/><br/>Taking that out of the equation, I'm proposing very little - basically just collecting what information there is and making it available.<br/><br/>I'm a little surprised by the reaction to that, as uncertainty seems to be one of the surest ways to turn new comers away in general. I can say that this is at least true of the scene in Portland, but clearly you guys place great value upon spontaneity and flexibility.

Because if they still have space open when a slot begins, they can pitch them to the other folks looking for a game and get a few more players. In the past, I've also seen one of the organizers walk around the room as people are gathering and ask people 1-on-1 or in small groups if they have something to pitch, which helps put a basic list together and provide some organization to the pitch circle. So then you can be like, "Ross Cowman! You're pitching Monsterhearts? Tell us about it!" <br/><br/>Maybe I'm just not understanding what you mean by having 75% of games pre-determined beforehand. You mean before the start of GameStorm?<br/><br/>I do think paper sign-ups are important, in that it helps people reserve spots in games if they feel less confident with the pitch circle or in the mob scramble that happens as people try to fill games. And that it's critical that the organizers make something happen for any folks who feel left out, and that game should rock socks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426789/#Comment_426789" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T11:28:48+00:00" title="January  7, 2014 11:28AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm responsible for myself for figuring out strategies to maximize my fun at Gamestorm (especially as an old hand), but just as a data point, I planned and scheduled less last year, got left out in the mob scramble twice on Saturday, left a bit dejected and didn't come back on Sunday.<br/><br/>I had better luck and strategy the two or three previous years and had a great time.<br/><br/>Success in spontaneity works a lot better for some at Indie Hurricaine than others.<br/><br/>I welcome Tayler's general approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426807/#Comment_426807" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T15:54:01+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  3:54PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another trick is to walk around through the crowd with a notepad 10 minutes before pitching and ask people, "what do you want to play?" and "are you pitching something this session?" I write down the games with little tally marks on my notepad, making note of who wants to run a given game. It helps me talk to people who are on the fence about running a game, or deciding which game to run.

It's time to start submitting games!<br/><br/>I'd like things to stick to the three slot schedule as much as possible. 10am-1pm, 2pm-6pm, 7pm-11pm. Open Story Gaming in the afternoon and evening on each day of the con.<br/><br/>For pre-scheduled games, just go to <a href="http://www.gamestorm.org" rel="nofollow">www.gamestorm.org</a> and register/propose events. Be sure to fill out all of the fields, and in the notes at the very bottom mention which times you'd like to run your game. Be sure to indicate your level of flexibility (if multiple times will do, or if only one will). On account of the scheduling system shenanigans this might get a little crazy, so please give me too much information rather than too little.<br/><br/>For Open Story Gaming, all you have to do is get in contact with me and let me know what time(s) work for you. If you know what you want to run, say so. It's okay if you change your mind later. <br/><br/>I'd like to do a kind of intro track in the afternoons on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Fiasco, Monsterhearts, Dungeon World, or some other indie mega hit. if you are interested in that, get in touch with me or just go ahead and propose it.<br/><br/>I've been toying with a way to rapidly demo games in the mornings, but I'd need a few inspired GMs for that. There is no way it could happen without a certain minimum support, so please get in touch with me if you are interested in that.<br/><br/>If you run 14 hours of games, next years admission is free! You also earn "GM Bucks" which you can exchange for mostly insignificant but sometimes kind of cool swag.<br/><br/>If you are interested in volunteering at the Indie Hurricane booth, also get in touch with me. I could use a few more volunteers. Volunteer 12 hours and your admission is free!<br/><br/>Finally, I'm scheduling one large-ish and one medium-ish event, which are Nordic and American Freeform games. Before and After Silence, and Play With Intent. I think some of you may be interested in that. Still working on the rooms for that.<br/><br/>You can reach me by emailing indiehurricane@gamestorm.org. I sometimes miss PMs on here, so that's not the best way.    <br/><br/>If you've got questions, let's have 'em.<br/><br/>Thanks guys! I hope you're all excited for this!<br/><br/>Tayler <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
