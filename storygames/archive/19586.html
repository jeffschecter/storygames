"Now that you're standing on the monster's head, you have a shot to stab it in its unarmored eye and inflict a grievous wound!  Well planned, well executed, bravely risked!"<br/><br/>I <i>don't</i> like when such relevance must be enforced by measuring the fiction in terms of game stats.  "Standing on the monster's head gives you +2 for high ground, +2 for opponent's awkward defense, the eye socket is a -8 target, but the fact that it's a giant creature makes that -4, hmm, now that I've flipped through all these pages is there anything else I've missed?"<br/><br/>But I <i>also</i> don't like it when the group can't agree on how character positioning matters.  Presumably, what all that statistical measurement avoids is this: "What?!  I'm on top of the monster's head and I <i>still</i> can't stab it in the eye?!"<br/><br/>Of course, there are very simple <i>social</i> ways to solve this:<br/><br/>Player: "I'd like to climb onto the monster.  Is that possible?  Once I did, how hard would it be to stab it in the eye?  And would that be a big deal?"<br/><br/>GM: "Not easy, but definitely possible!  If you get up, the stab wouldn't be hard, but not guaranteed either.  And yeah, a sword through the eye seems like a big deal."<br/><br/>But, if we were all awesome at that all the time, we'd probably all be playing freeform.  So I'd like to talk about rules.<br/><br/>It strikes me that Apocalypse World-style outcomes have something to contribute here -- "you take definite hold of it" (e.g.) doesn't require looking up any modifiers or thinking in system numerical terms, but it's still a step above "see if the GM thinks it matters".  (Probably.  Right?)<br/><br/>So!  What moves and other rules from AW-powered games do <i>you</i> like for this kind of stuff?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435317/#Comment_435317" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T12:35:27+00:00" title="July 15, 2014 12:35PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Defy Danger is a great catch-all for this that AW's Act Under Fire doesn't necessarily cover.

For this situation, climbing on the back would clearly be Act Under Pressure (which is pretty much the same as AW's Act Under Fire). I've never done this before, but for the 10+ result, I think it'd be reasonable to grant +1 forward -- the move as written says "you do what you set out to", and in this case the character set out to get an advantage.<br/><br/>If the monster's a giant Gila Monster and can't attack something on its back, I'd call for another Act Under Pressure to stab it in the eye.  On 10+ success of that one, I'd declare a large amount of damage ("inflict harm as established"); on a 6- fail, the monster would probably shake off the character, who would take damage and/or land in the worst possible place; on a mixed 7-9 result, something... mixed.<br/><br/>But if it's a were-squid that has no problem attacking its own back, the stab is just Kick Some Ass and the character is going to take damage even on success... which I think is pretty reasonable if someone had the bright idea of jumping on the back of something that could attack someone there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435325/#Comment_435325" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T14:07:25+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  2:07PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great question, Dave.

The broader category -- "what you set out to do" -- leaves room for interpretation without being totally freeform.  Not sure about the +1 forward, though.  How easy is it to derive that outcome?

But I do use a similar approach in DayTrippers.  <br/><br/>Granted, there's a little bit of play in my suggestion, but I think the FUDGE mods are a little better than the purely social solution because after you use them for a while, the group starts to gel on their idea of what "Good" vs "Great" means.  It's certainly easier than a Rolemaster-like solution (which is likewise descriptive but includes ten categories of difficulty), and less complex than flipping through five different tables looking for relevant mods.  Judgment call.  <br/><br/>It should <i>not</i> be about the players jockeying for a +2 vs a +1.  This is a OSR kind of solution: it's the GM's call.

One of the basic moves is Move With Intention, which is essentially "Obtain Beneficial Fictional Positioning." It allows for you to take forward or easily place Tags on a foe or the environment - Tags that are binding to the fiction. While making moves that take advantage of a Tag doesn't passively grant a bonus, you can spend a point of Chi (a dual-purpose resource and xp) to instantly bump up that roll to the next sucess bracket (6- to 7-9, 7-9 to 10+).<br/><br/>To show how that would work with the head-jump eye-stab, Tokkar runs at the grizzly-toad and jump up onto its head. He Moves With Intention to do so, and for simplicity here he rolls a 10+, choosing to take +1 forward and put the tag Under Tokkar's Feet on the grizzly-toad. When he stabs it in the eye with his knife, he Commits Open Violence (another basic move). He rolls a 6, made into a 7 by the +1 forward (passive benefit of fictional positioning regulated by rules). Being alone a grizzly-toad sucks though, so he spends a point of Chi to take advantage of the tag and bump his 7 to a 10. Resolving the move, he gives the beast the tag Blinded and is not in imminent fear of direct counterattack.<br/><br/>Tags go away when they logically don't matter anymore. Move With Intention can be used socially if you're a bit creative.<br/><br/>The fictional positioning thing was something I puzzleed on a lot. How does this stack up to what you want from fictional positioning in a PbtA game? It's a bit fiddly, but I've found it pretty smooth in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435346/#Comment_435346" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T17:14:30+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  5:14PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">@horn_head_o</a> - Oh that's you!<br/><a href="http://www.logbook-project.com/p/avatar-world_23.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.logbook-project.com/p/avatar-world_23.html</a><br/>I read your early AW APs long ago, and I really liked em.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435347/#Comment_435347" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T17:27:55+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  5:27PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Regiment.
