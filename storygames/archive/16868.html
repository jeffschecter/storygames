I take some constraint, idea or ideology that didn't originate in this game, and try to shoehorn it in. <i>Let's try to make this game with all-women characters, because there are too few games like that! Let's actively avoid love relationships, because those are in so many games already!</i> Etc. <br/><br/>The shoehorn sometimes comes from a fear that the game will be unoriginal. "Oh no, this is so obvious! From here I know how everything's going to work, and so will everyone else, and it's all been done before!" But mostly, I think it comes from not having all faculties present. A part of me that is needed for good design just isn't awake/activated, but I still want to make something, so I sit down and <i>try</i>.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>So I'm thinking about how I should do things. How do I work best, when I design games? <br/><br/>I believe my personal forte is process, teamwork, getting people to play well together. Thinking about these things, I feel lucid, in control, like I'm exploring some bigger thought that - to me - feels important. Three of my favorite games (that is, of my own games) have this feeling, for me: Fuck Youth, Archipelago and Catherine. They are simple, they are very open, they don't say much about content; they are all about how you play together, and they do it simply and elegantly. <br/><br/>Fuck Youth and Catherine arrived very simply. They had a seed of content, a basic idea, and I just started writing from there. There was hardly any design or change in concept; they just unfolded at the speed of writing. With Archipelago I can't even remember how the core arrived - only that I had a pretty much full-fledged design at the first playtest, and it hasn't changed much since.<br/><br/>There is a lucidity, a calmness and flow when I make these games. They seem to just arrive, randomly, when they feel like it. But they are very often triggered by something - some challenge, some spark from outside.<br/><br/>And the games feel healthy. Like a good idea that needs to be spread to the world <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> They feel, to me, as if they will make the participants more human, their interactions more positive and whole somehow. They are an idealized view of good cooperation, good teamwork, good community.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>So. I'm thinking that, from experience, if I don't have the basic game idea ready after the first sit-down, there's really not much use in spending weeks trying to make it work on paper. It's a slightly depressing thought. <br/><br/>However, I do have experience that the first version can be <i>playtested, then altered</i> over many iterations, making a good game. The problem with this is that the version I finally write down is so familiar to me that I am unable to convey it to others properly. (Society of Dreamers is the major example of this - whether people "get" it or not is completely hit-and-miss, but if they do, they have a great time with it.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard" title="Anders Nygaard"><img alt="Anders Nygaard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/404/nXX62OQ3D3YOT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard">Anders Nygaard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384560/#Comment_384560" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-08T09:36:41+00:00" title="July  8, 2012  9:36AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually don't get to try out ideas as complete games, partly because I need a bit of a run up, or several run ups, to finish a text in the first place. And because I'm way too shy about getting everyone together to try out something *I* made all by myself. I like having and often rely on the borrowed authority of a Famous Game Designer hovering in the background.<br/><br/>But I think intriguing core ideas are central in order to keep players interested and engaged. That holds true whether you cram them into someone elses game, just give it the D&amp;D treatment, or assemble a framework to hold the idea from scratch.<br/><br/>When doing scenarios, you can dangle the cool bits of your idea as a carrot, partially reveal them, let people play with them or even reject and dismantle them. (Okay - you're generic elves being elvesy in the woods. Now something bad has happened, so we need to have a little politics minigame to decide what to do. Whoa this is middle earth. Oh shit now ALL the orcs are comingandweareallgonnadieRUN) Strangely, not giving your whole gimmick up as a "hardwired" part of the pitch and rules intro for a new game, but inserting it in the major stage changes and scene pitches could help people catch on to the core idea, as they will approach it trough play, and that will help them make it their own?<br/><br/>No matter what you do to hold on to it, that subversion of core ideas will probably happen no matter what you do; I started writing "Old Dogs" with the idea of capturing the feel of a cross-country skiing trip I had just returned from. I hadn't gone skiing in years, and had an impression fresh in mind which I wanted to convey - testing out what's still working, chatting and reminding each other of various aspects of the task, preparing and blaming the equipment, rediscovering little details and tricks, feeling muscle memory waking up, and finally a kind of exhilarating meditative joy I had forgotten about. The feeling didn't even survive the writing process, but it's still a fun game poem, which caught different people's imagination in completely different ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384562/#Comment_384562" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-08T10:51:55+00:00" title="July  8, 2012 10:51AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2012 10:54AM by Sebastian.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very insightful post.<br/><br/>Both my published games were written in response to competitions, buried deep within a period of game research.

I'm now going to sit down for the next two weeks and write that game."  More that, I think it'd be interesting to try or would solve some logistical problem that causes stress, and then it goes to hang out in my backbrain with a bunch of ideas that have got lots of colour but no structure, and eventually some of them get together and have a party.  But there's a point in there where the mechanical idea and the colour idea start informing each other, which is the part of the creative process that gets me really happy and engaged.  That flow state you talk about?  Yeah, constraints help that a lot for me, but I have to let the writing come in its own time.<br/><br/>(Also, it helps me a lot to arrange to debut a game at a con - otherwise I procrastinate way too much; but if I've announced the game, I have to run it.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
