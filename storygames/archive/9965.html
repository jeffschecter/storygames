To begin, roll your stats.';<br/>\nPLAYER: 'Oh wow, how do I do that? I can't wait to see my kewl stats with which I can beat the world!';<br/>\nGM: 'Uh, 3d6 in order. To be a psionic techno-wizard you need to get an M.E. of 12 or more.'<br/>\nPLAYER: 'Wha?'<br/>\nGM: 'But don't worry. You can be a nanotech-enhanced druid as long as you can get a P.E. of 10 or less, or a bio-engineered techno-soldier without any stat requirements.'<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I've got several Palladium products, and my enthusiasm for their depth of setting is always tempered by my cynicism about their core system. But, then, character generation is always an entertaining muddle of randomness, and you usually get an interesting character from it. But then you see people talk about mega-damage, and you agree with them, but yet...<br/>\n<br/>\nI've never played it. It looks massively clunky, with 4+ attacks per round and the whole 'roll 5 or more to hit on a d20' nonsense. But to take MDC, for instance, I can see it not bothering me. I can see it being one of those 'meh' rules that you imagine will make the game unplayable but never does. The same with the power level balance issues... since when has that been a problem for anyone? Has anyone ever played an OD&amp;D; cleric?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, does anyone here have any experience of actually playing Palladium products with good (or bad) experiences? I'm asking here because I think the story games community is pretty close on the button with my gaming tastes, and I really want to love Palladium. My suspicion is that the rules are more robust than critics say, and that the crunch/fluff sweet spot of their books make it all worthwhile... but for the moment it's a guilty dream to run/play a Palladium game. I'd love it to become a guilty pleasure. Or, alternatively, has anyone run/played games in the Palladium universe using other (perhaps more flexible.. like, uh, anything...) systems, particularly freeform systems like The Pool and that?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221216/#Comment_221216" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T15:45:26+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  3:45PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Way back when I was in Jr High/High School I played me a lot of Rifts (and D&amp;D and... well that was it) even then we had lots of problems with the game but since it was the only way we knew how to have giant mecha duke it out with giant monsters/vampires/nazis in a post apocalypse magic world we stuck too it.

One of the things I like was the experience chart, which rewarded all kinds of play behaviour. I used to make players keep lists of things they did that deserved XP, and then compare their lists to mine at the end of  a game session, and make them pitch to me why I should give them points if there were discrepancies.<br/><br/>I love the gonzo setting, but massive amounts of metaplot and power creep phased me out.<br/><br/>The character creation is brutally long, and the skill list is insane, especially since it's added to with every supplement, and only the classes in the new books get access to the new skills (so whatever the wilderness adventurer guy in the corebook is can't have trapmaking as a skill, because trapmaking is in some supplement). It could easily be streamlined into something nice and smooth while still maintaining the gonzo flavour by just simplifying the skill list.<br/><br/>On one hand, I like the whole MDC system since I like the idea of weapons so potent they can vapourize conventional life, but it turns me off in that characters without it quickly find themselves to be red stains, since every single monster in the setting does Mega-Damage, and every organized group has MDC weapons, armour, and/or magic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221230/#Comment_221230" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T17:01:32+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  5:01PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just as your question might be taken as a joke, similarly my response might be taken as a joke. <br/>but it isn't one.<br/><br/>I didn't find that my ideas translated well into character form with Palladium rules. my characters alwaays ended up with two or three dozen skills BEYOND those i'd ever use- i bet a lot of the system could be lopped off without any ill effects. <br/><br/>what i DID enjoy, however, was sitting at the table quietly, daydreaming about my character and what they would do in other situations that we were not currently facing,<br/>or thinking about their reactions to things going on in the fiction around us.<br/>This was made possible by the Palladium system due to its plodding pace; the only other game i'd played at that point was Ad&amp;d 2nd, and that was lightning-quick compared to Rifts<br/>or Heroes Unlimited or TMNT or Ninjas &amp; Superspies. But these games delivered something that our present games do not: focus-time to sit and contemplate the character,<br/>as the game-world moves in slow-motion around you.<br/><br/>It's funny how participation-heavy games can leave you pineing for quiet moments, yes?<br/><br/>Also, there was never any danger that our characters would die, we had too much armor and too little interest in playing long enough to be endangered.<br/>Fuck, character creation took way too long, though. <br/>Like, so long that use of swear words is absolutely fucking called for.<br/><br/>yep.<br/><br/>-jackson                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221233/#Comment_221233" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T17:05:25+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  5:05PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played years of Robotech.  Actually I was always the GM.  I think it somewhat works for Robotech because, once you're in the mecha, there's no need to worry about SDC or percentage skills.  Those are all out of the equation, so you're left with MDC attacks and armor, some fiddling on how many attacks you get and at what bonus, and off you go.  We liked it because we used to play Battletech and MechWarrior before that, and Robotech had the original design mechs (so the "Warhammer", i.e. Excalibur, actually had missiles in its shoulders like it showed even in some Battletech books) plus no board--it played more like a roleplaying game than a miniatures wargame.<br/><br/>There are some problems with the mecha system, still.  For example, you could wait until the opposition had no more actions left to dodge, then fire a 40 missile salvo at them that was sure to annihilate them.  Dogfighting was so lame that I made my own system based on using the percentile piloting skill, where the outcome of the roll led to a certain position (chase, face-to-face, flanking, etc.), with each position having certain potential outcomes.  That made it fun enough.<br/><br/>Again, though, we barely ever used the rules for stuff outside the mecha.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221236/#Comment_221236" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T17:11:35+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  5:11PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I too was a middle/high school Palladium junkie.  Nowadays, I think I would play them with something John Harper wrote, like Agon or Danger Patrol, because they are very fighty, but only, uh, superficially so.  Like, Agon is great at delivering that micro-pleasure of hitting monsters in the face over and over while talking trash, but it's not a super deep tactical game or anything.  And Danger Patrol is a hodge-podge of things barely held together by excitement and genre trappings (and that's pretty much a perfect definition of Rifts as well).  Palladium stuff isn't rocket science... it's a rocket strapped to a shark that does lots of damage and gives you XP when it explodes.  Even the potentially more subtle games like Nightbane and Ninjas &amp; Superspies end up leaning in that direction.<br/><br/>As it stands, the Palladium rules corpus only really has nostalgia going for it, despite some smart folks like Erick Wujcik and C.J. Carella working on it.

A friend of mine has been running a M&amp;M Rifts game for us off and on, and we've been having a lot of fun with it.<br/><br/>Rules aside, the Palladium games are a wonderful source of color. Rifts is such a kitchen-sink setting that if you narrow your focus a bit you have a really good shot at coming up with a fun campaign.<br/><br/>For me, it always calls out to the "Ellis-Moore" lobe of my brain - There's this desire to reboot the setting with more grown-up sensibilities, to treat it as serious subject matter and thus <i>make</i> it serious, in much the same way Ellis turned the Avengers into the Ultimates, and made a G.I. Joe cartoon where people actually die, or how Ronald Moore rebooted Galactica. (Yes, I know people hate the ending. Take it to another thread please.)<br/><br/>It's telling that I still have quite a few Rifts sourcebooks on my shelf, while most of the other rules-heavy old-school stuff has gone away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221377/#Comment_221377" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T06:13:20+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  6:13AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a ton of RIFTS/Heroes Unlimited/Palladium/Nightbane/Ninjas and Superspies books,,, an entire shelf full. I also get the Palladium Grab Bag nearly every year at Christmas.<br/><br/>I really enjoy the setting. I like Kevin's way of looking at his world (the Tolkeen War was an excellent series of sourcebooks and a source of endless debates amongst the RIFTS faithful), I really enjoyed the artwork of Ramon Perez, and anything written by Bill Coffin was gold.<br/><br/>The game system was a mixed bag for me. I felt it was a lot like early D&amp;D/D20, and the percentage systems for skills seemed to work just fine. It was fiddly, but so was D&amp;D. I found myself using all sorts of elements from the game books and loved the fact it was all interchangeable, so if I wanted a Juicer superhero battling Hounds in the streets of Atlantis, I could figure out a way to do that. The power creep worked just fine for me, because I tend to like epic-level super heroics. Loved getting new books and quickly scanning for the cool new guns, armor and critters.<br/><br/>I drifted away from Palladium mostly due to the limitations of the game system. I would get frustrated with the time it took to create a character. I broke a lot of the rules of the game to do what I wanted, which meant a lot of arbitrary decisions on my part (sure that character can have that skill regardless of his background because that is what I want him to do). I went back and forth between SDC and MDC, because each let me do different kinds of fights and encounters, but neither did exactly what I wanted them to do. <br/><br/>I still love the game setting and materials, but I think there are better systems out there. I have a soft spot in my heart for Palladium, so I bristle under needless bashing of the game. It has become a fashionable whipping boy of the geek world, and I have little respect for that. I don't mind people who say they don't like the game or point out its flaws, but I had years and years of good times with the game and still collect and read the books, so I know it isn't as bad as everyone wants it to be, so someone saying "RIFTS sucks!" to get a few cheap laughs annoys me (understand, Im not refering to people on this board, mostly thinking of a few podcasts which use Palladium-bashing as a crutch for their geek rage).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221383/#Comment_221383" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T06:49:29+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  6:49AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your comments, guys; it's pretty much as I suspected.

Or, I guess, M&amp;M; - which is pretty much the most flexible d20-based game I've seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's something endearing about all of the settings though, and about how openly hodgepodge the system is.

Rifts is this quintessential 1980s game where tight leather and giant dirty war machines is where it's at, magic users and crazy cyborg chop-shops are hip and subversive, and a neo-fascist police state governs from giant mega-cities while the countryside is a Mad Max wasteland. It has a lot in common with games like Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun, the fluff of Warhammer 40K, and other 1980s refugees that can only be played while listening to Slayer or something.  But the "megaverse" aspect of Rift often led it to being much more gonzo, even more so than genre-crash-fests like Shadowrun and 40K.  Still, the fact that it actually has a setting -- some of which is actually pretty interesting -- sets it apart from even more open-ended genre-crash games before and since (Gatecrasher? anything that was like "dragons + rayguns = awesome!" or "play any character you can imagine... and we'll throw them all into the same game!"), and I think that's honestly what's led to its popularity and continued existence.  It provides a premise and platform for genre-crash that isn't just pure nonsense.<br><br>Also, Ramon Perez has been really, really good for Palladium, especially in the years since Kevin Long, R.K. Post, and Vince Martin stopped illustrating for them.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221401/#Comment_221401" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T08:15:06+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  8:15AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first exposure to Palladium was the Fantasy game, before anything else came out.

Setting wise my problem was the way they went into things as an example north America gets the loving like crazy, a book to cover large areas of the rest of the world and then a smattering of random world books. It would have seemed more natural to detail the world more and if you do world books do them for worlds directly interacting with the Earth not random things like wormwood (which on its own is awesome).<br/>\n  That said what is detailed about the Earth is mostly awesome and totally worth stapling to another system. I personally suggest Tri-Stat dx it has a built in method for scaling ie a character that has "supernatural" strength could simply use d4's instead of d6's.

I find it fast and pretty smooth, especially given where it started from.  I have always been amazed at how quickly combat runs.  Most combats I've run last about a melee and a half, so call that what 8-10 rolls max?  That's pretty fast for combat that can be as detailed as Rifts is.  And if Rifts is anything, it's detailed when it comes to combat: Called Strikes, Bursts, Weapon Proficiencies.  The game gets down to brass tacks in combat (Combat Simulationism) and does it in a way that's really streamlined.<br/><br/>Also, the actions per melee thing always made sense to me seeing as how the more trained you are, the more shots you're going to get to take at an opponent.  Plus, all those actions tend to make combat faster since the people who can crush in combat (read: the PCs and the big bad guys) attack more.<br/><br/>Outside of combat, things get a little wonky, but not that wonky.  Palladium gets house ruled like every other game of its ilk gets house ruled, but somehow Palladium gets a bad name for it.  For instance in my games, I pretty much do hand waving over stats as long as players control the madness, but I do the same in D&amp;D since really the stats shouldn't go from 3-30.  They only really get interesting at 16.<br/><br/>Even the skills, perhaps the weakest area in Palladium, serve their function representing how good a character is at non-fighty bits and giving you a way to gauge margin of success.<br/><br/>I guess my thought is that if want to play Rifts, play Rifts.  It's not as tight mechanically as say Dogs or even Agon, but it does what it tries to do pretty well.  And in a way where everyone can have fun.  It's not going to give you a hardcore narrative experience or allow for a lot of player authoring.  It's going to give you a game where you play a half-Zentradi Crazy piloting a retrofitted Glitter Boy shooting at genetically engineered dog soldiers. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Okay, I'm off the soap box.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221560/#Comment_221560" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T02:04:35+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  2:04AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know all there is to know about roleplaying, so there's no sense us going down that same old road again.

With the lower number of hit points (no SDC, no MDC), lower number of attacks per round, and the lower attack bonuses the armor system actually works until high levels, where armor gradually becomes useless as the attack bonus ends up pushing attacks that hit way over the armor ratings. The skill system is reminiscent of old D&amp;D; - being that low level characters suck at everything, even the things they don't completely suck at. The trick is to do the same thing you would do with Dark Heresy and give positive modifiers to skill checks at low levels (easy lock to pick = +20%; sneaking up on distracted guards = +15%; etc...). The core of the system <b>really</b> works.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played and ran in TMNT games for several years in high school. Character creation is awesome, but we hit our first issue with skill escalation in this game - skills start boosting stats, so to make a good combat character, you need to pick up a bunch of the physical skills to boost your physical stats and to build up a huge pile of SDC. This was also the game that started having multiple attacks at level 1 - but it worked here because you had to get rid of more hit points in your foes, and damnit - you are playing ninjas! I still have my favourite character in a folder somewhere - he is the lone survivor of a team of five that we made using the team characters rules. He managed to crawl away from what would otherwise have been a TPK.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobotech. I don't think I need to say much more on this. Still one of my all time fave RPG settings, and until the Invid Invasion books, the SDC / MDC divide makes sense and works.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all cases, combat does run quickly - the system has been designed fairly well for that. As they increased your damage capacity, they also increased your ability to deal it (through multiple attacks typically). It gets boring quickly in melee though in the newer games (Rifts, Palladium Fantasy 2nd edition). SDC gun combat works pretty well, doubly so if you make sure to use the weapon rules from Robotech instead of the ones in the old editions of TMNT.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>In the Bad Experiences Folder</b>:<br/>\n<br/>\nStats are kind of wonky in that they never give you a bonus until you hit really high numbers - much like AD&amp;D1.; This is something I enjoy about most "modern" games - stats actually make a difference even in the mid-ranges. It's something I would house-rule (to the d20 style stat bonuses) if I were running Palladium Fantasy again now.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we got to TMNT, skills became core to characters - but not because they let you do thins, but because they boosted all your combat abilities. With a skill pick you would have the choice of having a 50% chance to successfully read sensory instruments, or you can give yourself +1 attack per round, a strength boost, and extra hit points (SDC). This is less prevalent in Rifts purely because those boosts don't make a huge difference when you are a magical dragon from another dimension, or an alien bounty hunter loaded with cool gear. But in the mid-range games (TMNT, Robotech, Beyond the Supernatural, Ninjas and StupidGuys) skill choices decide whether your character is functional in combat, or meat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Rifts especially, but also in some of the other games like Robotech, there is little concept of "balance" between character power. You can make a character who starts with a huge MDC weapon and armor, or a character that can have neither. As long as everyone is cool with this and you have some ideas of how to run with it as the GM, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Running urban and social adventures is a good way to keep things on the level (and also penalize the guys who put all their skills into those physical skills earlier), but sooner or later the shit will hit the fan, and the Glitterboys and Dragons will be shining examples of what happens when you put a tank battalion up against a dozen guys on horseback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
