I've been reading Twenty-Four Game Poems by Marc Majcher and love the concept of these gaming "meditations". I'd love to know of any Game Poems you find exceptionally enjoyable or powerful, as well as any great resources you know for finding new Game Poems. I'd also like to know your personal thoughts on the Game Poem, even if you hate them I would be very interested to understand what it is you dislike.<br/><br/>Here's my contribution to the conversation:<br/><a href="http://gamepoems.gizmet.com/" rel="nofollow">Game Poems</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400896/#Comment_400896" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T19:48:02+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  7:48PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like The Believers quite a lot.

One of my favorites was the game where you play travelers in space, sending messages to eachother. There is a time delay, though, so sometimes you hold a message before passing it along to the person to whom it is intended. It makes a wonderful fugue of interlayered story dialogues. <br/><br/>I should make it a point to play each of them, at some point, this year. There are many I've not played yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400908/#Comment_400908" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T21:10:21+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  9:10PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a number of good roleplaying poems on <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Norwegian Style</a> if you poke around a bit.<br/><br/>The past few years at GPNW we have played short-form (10 mins-1 hour) games on Sunday morning, and we usually get through 4-5 of them in a nice little session. <br/><br/>We played <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/old-dogs/" rel="nofollow">Old Dogs</a> for the first time this year, and it was a hoot! I think we also played It Wasn't Me, The Believers and Seance. <br/><br/>One thing that is challenging for me is bringing them to the table for a quick fix before a "normal" game session. I've usually run into "well why don't we just play the game we came here to play?" I dunno, maybe people don't want to shift gears, or they don't want to switch between two sets of rules? I think it's mostly down to social contract. Expectations for a gaming session are typically: show up-&gt;kvetch while you wait for the late people-&gt;intro new people to the group-&gt;start playing.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_400909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400909/#Comment_400909" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T22:09:28+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 10:09PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ceasar; people come with expectations.
