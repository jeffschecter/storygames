I decided to come here, because in the distant past when I've come here, you all seemed like smart, reasonable people. <br/><br/>I talk about the Forge in a negative way in the post, and while I know many of you were members, as I was (a lurker), I hope that my points can stand even among a group of people who are very interested in game theory. <br/><br/>So I've come to you, not to rile things up, but to see if reasonable discussion can be had about this topic. If not, I understand, and apologize for bothering you. I'm not putting on an act here. Despite my post (which is made in my online home, so to speak),  I do not want to needlessly offend people. I'm hoping anyone who reads this can see through the forceful opinions, and see what I mean. <br/><br/>Can anyone here read it and see if they understand why I felt I needed to make the post? It's here: <br/><br/><a href="https://yetzirah-games.squarespace.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">https://yetzirah-games.squarespace.com/blog/</a><br/><br/>Thank you. I'm not really thinking about taking it down, but I need to know if I'm losing the wrong people with it. I like the games many of you make, and I'd hate to carpet bomb any potential interactions we might have in the future. I am open to conversation, and will take anything that comes of this potential conversation to heart, and address any issues.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459928/#Comment_459928" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-05T20:09:34+00:00" title="February  5, 2017  8:09PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read your posts yet, but I wanted to say that this is a kind, thoughtful post, and I really appreciate it.

Overly negative? Purposefully inflammatory?<br/><br/>All that to describe how Your Thing is different from this Other Thing (which may or may not be like you describe it), as if to ... draw a line in the sand to make certain that anybody GETS that Tribute is totally not a Story Game\u2122!!!<br/><br/>And all that seems kinda ... weird? Like, who cares whether Your Thing is like this Other Thing? You seem very definite about it not being part of The Forge design tradition which is ... cool? You do your thing and all that. \xaf\\_(\u30c4)_/\xaf<br/><br/>But why then do the whole diss on the Forge at all? Why the cutesy "Ha Ha but kinda serious" cult thing, instead of just going "Here's my thing! In case anybody's wondering, I come at this from another direction than this Other Thing! Yay!"? <br/><br/>Is "Tribute is a Story Game" an often-held missconception that somehow needed correction?

No need to take these thoughts as counter-points or rebuttals, even as some of them necessarily come out that way in the context of your post.<br/><br/>You have some interestingly mangled ideas about the GNS theory, at least, which is sort of an expected genre element for a good old fashioned anti-Forge rant <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The most visible weirdness is that for some reason you have the GNS theory saying that a game can support two GNS agendas at once, but not all three. The orthodox idea is that you can only ever play towards one agenda at once, and thus a game that might facilitate several is at best doing useless extra work and at worst just being more confusing than it needs to be.<br/><br/>You also have some sort of a point about character immersion that doesn't ring that familiar to me - the "brain damage" debacle wasn't about character immersion nor about "Immersionism" (the suggested creative agenda of desiring for immersion), and properly speaking the orthodox idea (meaning, what Ron thought about it at the time - I don't think that others really developed any clear stances on it) about Immersionism was that it's more of a subjective perspective on "being really focused in playing the game" than a creative agenda per se. (This notion resembles the Nordic "flow state" analysis of character immersion, which might be useful to look into for further understanding.)<br/><br/>Regarding your cult thing, I don't have any strong disagreement about the particulars. As you say, some cult-like - or equivalently, clique-like - social dynamics could be observed around the Forge at times. I don't personally think that it's such a big deal, though, because I don't hate efficient cadre dynamics in an artistic work environment, and you can't have those (at least not with homo sapiens) without having at least a little bit of the insularity you mention. What's it to you if some other people like to gather together to develop rpg design and publishing in a serious way? Nothing substantially specific in the Forge itself caused it to be cult-like, and it never had any sort of official cult-like structures, so railing about it is basically just railing against any successful work-group activity at all. Which, of course, always was a big motivation for complaining about the Forge the way I saw it: the very idea that other people are having fun accomplishments without them must have stuck fiercely to some serious roleplayers' craws at the time.<br/><br/>(Note that it's not the Forge's fault as a community or organization if somebody came there, got their heads full of stuff and then made an ass of themselves at other forums. There was, again, no policy about that sort of thing whatsoever, because the Forge was always a public web forum providing a platform for exchange and distribution of ideas. Despite the crack-headed punditry one would hear at times, there never was a conspiracy council at the Forge sending out missionaries to convert people - it was all individuals reacting to the workshop and its ideas in their own ways.)<br/><br/>Regarding your attempts at differentiating your game from the Forge, my own gut sense is that it's something of a dead horse to beat - probably not many people around anymore who'll care, so it's probably not a first priority marketing-wise. Of course if it's important to you to make your own peace with the subject, then rock on. To me the accusations about other people's jargon being bad and yours being good, as well as the arguments about how your game is not a "story game", seem frivolous, but I'm sure it's easier to ascribe good intentions to yourself than others.<br/><br/>I'd like to hear more about Retrostar, personally - sounds like an interesting game to me, and the cover art's gorgeous.<br/><br/>Finally: could you make a list of those story games that have an agenda and push it in a crappy way, and are apparently part of some sort of a Forgite/Scientologist conspiracy? I've found that it's easier to discuss things if you're specific about your claims, and that one's unfortunately vague: "Some games somewhere that somebody called Story Games are bad, but my game's not like them" is pretty unhelpful, if you stop to think about it, right? I'm not trying to play gotcha with how difficult it is to make comprehensive lists - if you could just name two or three titles, so as to establish a pattern, I'm sure that other people could help fill out the list if it's a trend for people to make propagandistic story games. Besides, it would probably help people in understanding where you're coming from if you really dropped some names of games and designers you really hate for their cultic brainwashing habits <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>In summation: your blog post doesn't offend me, and I don't think that it will offend many people in general. There are really thin-skinned people out there, but I don't think that very many of those are in the habit of carrying a flag for the Forge, so you're not likely to get a mob after you or anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459936/#Comment_459936" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-05T21:03:26+00:00" title="February  5, 2017  9:03PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Lol.

So I see it as part of that overall discussion and welcome the debate. If people feel it is important to drill down into D&amp;D and see whether it has any troubling fascist aspects in its content or origins, I think it only makes sense that that probe would be directed inward as well to see if story games have any troubling in content or origins as well. By the logic of that thread his argument is sound: he provided a big list of things that cults do and connected them to things the forge did. Isn't that how we establish whether something is the worse thing since Hitler or Manson?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan" title="Rskennan"><img alt="Rskennan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan">Rskennan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459937/#Comment_459937" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-05T21:03:56+00:00" title="February  5, 2017  9:03PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was a series of private messages on Facebook.

It was back in the 90s. I spent a long time and a lot of false starts trying different ways of doing it. At every step, I'd seem to be getting close, then fail. <br/><br/>Eventually, I decided I needed a model of reality to crib from. I figured I needed some sort of pictographic alphabet or symbol set to name for my "Elements". I wanted to take the logic of (whatever system) and turn it into game mechanics. Easy.<br/><br/>I eventually found myself reading up on Phoenician, which incidentally looks a bit like pathways for energy- sort of circuits, at least to me. This was the kind of thing I was looking for. But I had no real context. What does the character meaning "House" mean? Containment for sure. But many of the other characters, like the one for "fish" were opaque to me. What did a fish represent to an ancient people like the Phoenicians. Food obviously, but what was its significance as a symbol? In their myths and aphorisms? I hit a dead end. <br/><br/>This all led me to (Lurianic) Kabbalah, of which I was only familiar with via the tree of life. Suddenly here were reams of essays on each letter, along with the sephiroth of the tree of life. This is important. This means something. But I had no cultural or religious background to really grok it. <br/><br/>13 years and two trips to the mental institution later, along with some consulting with a famous Kabbalistic Rabbi, I got it. I've tried to present earlier versions that weren't ready for prime time, and found myself very, very embarrassed by my inability to explain the game. Surely, those incidents of mental illness weren't because of the reaction I had to optical steroids. I really was crazy. <br/><br/>But again, I eventually got rules for my game that made sense to most other people who read them. Here's how I did it, more or less. <br/><br/>I made a bunch of tables based on the Sepher Yetzirah's model of reality, as (the claim) literally spoken into being by the creator. <br/><br/>This meant the big table had three "mother" letters in it- the basic sounds of Hebrew speech, 7 "Double letters"- which have two sounds each and stand for contrary qualities like life and death (a determining factor of whether you have that thing), and twelve simple letters, which represent simple concepts like the "source of laughter", or "seeing". <br/><br/>All told, I tried to learn about each force- letter or sephirah, and to find an English Key word that said something "true" about the idea, but didn't lie about it. This Key word had to be both a noun and a verb, because I wanted you to be able to "House a Counter", or "Counter a House". <br/><br/>Incidentally, I was right about the House meaning- it's about containment, specifically the world's containment inside the creator, but also every copy of that concept, through all the layers of reality. An actual house is a kabbalistic "House", but so is you body, or your mind. Tribute defines it as any container that is mainly a container, and the act of bringing something in, or Housing it. Plain English words for the crazy ideas. The rules extrapolate into what they can be used for in the game, but their actual definition is basic English, translated into mechanics. I try to bring the big idea down to earth, then discuss how it can be more interesting. I probably do a much better job than I'm doing today, because I take great care with each card. <br/><br/>I can go further on this, without the prologue, if you'd like. It's not a great elevator pitch, but it describes how I did what I'm claiming. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan" title="Rskennan"><img alt="Rskennan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan">Rskennan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459947/#Comment_459947" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-05T21:55:58+00:00" title="February  5, 2017  9:55PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elevator pitch: Tribute is an Effects-based Toolkit Rpg based on the model of reality presented in Lurianic Kabbalah.

Easy.</blockquote>\nYeah, this is a familiar train of thought - makes sense. I used to call it an "oracular" approach to setting up a game: you take a pre-existing system of inter-related symbols and meanings, and that provides you with an atmospheric base chassis for the gameplay to occur around. At the simplest it's simply a Tarot reading (no coincidence that many games go with Tarot here): you make the reading of whatever system it is and apply that to the fiction.<br/><br/>Many games make a resolution system out of this sort of thing, but it's also possible to use it as the basis of e.g. the character description rules, like all those wuxia games that use Chinese elements as character stats. The resolution approach is particularly noteworthy in that it tends to produce "oracular" resolution systems that focus less on pass/fail and more on "what happens next". Whether Tarot, runes-casting, I Ching or Chinese fortune cookies (as in one memorable Finnish game), an oracular resolution system can make for an atmospheric and interpretative conflict resolution system.\n<blockquote>I can go further on this, without the prologue, if you'd like.

I think there were a lot of other questionable claims as well that needed to be confronted. It is one thing to design a game and say, this is fun and interesting, give it a try. It is another to suggest you have medicine for fascism in the form of a game and that people who play it will be less fascist in their thinking. Now you are offering people a cure or therapy and I think it is fair to ask, what makes you such an expert/why should I believe you when you can't even arrive at a working definition of fascism. <br/><br/>But that doesn't mean I am against free debate. I was hoping to parallel would maybe demonstrate to people the silliness of the original argument regarding Old School D&amp;D and fascism.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan" title="Rskennan"><img alt="Rskennan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan">Rskennan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459952/#Comment_459952" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-05T22:31:35+00:00" title="February  5, 2017 10:31PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for how it's intended to play, I am releasing it in three stages. These are very bad terms for the versions, but the first one is as light as the game gets, and focuses on broad powers like taking control of something, damaging it, etc. these are all very broad- investment in these powers represents the over types of things you're good at, not specific powers-the first 10 Keys.  The next level adds support for specific powers and motivations, a bit more rules medium-10 Keys. The final level adds all the crunchy tactical stuff that makes some people mad. Things like effect durations, precise movement, etc. And it does it by adding 12 keys.<br/><br/>The idea is that you can stop at any stage and have a game to play, and even decide that you don't want your game to include specific keys. You can play a whole minigame with just one Power Key. They're all conflict resolution systems. <br/><br/>For example, Take the Counter (Power) Key, representing Resistance, reaction, and damage (but not destruction, you normally have to pay experience to make anything permanent).  You could play a game with just this Key, and gloss anything else. You'd have  a game where any problem needed to be ablated, and everything was about commitment and suffering your way to success. I 'don;t want to play that, but someone might. <br/><br/>Games made with Tribute will be called "Spins"; focused games made from the Tribute Keys. The whole thing can be a game protyping engine.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan" title="Rskennan"><img alt="Rskennan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan">Rskennan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459953/#Comment_459953" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-05T22:32:25+00:00" title="February  5, 2017 10:32PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to head out for a while, but I do appreciate the feedback, even if you guys aren't loving my means of arrival here.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459954/#Comment_459954" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-05T22:39:10+00:00" title="February  5, 2017 10:39PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah Brendan, I got the sense that we're going for a reductio ad absurdum here, as they used to say before it became strawmen all the way down in the rhetorical culture.

The fact that you spend so many vitriolic words trying to distance yourself from them, as well as the fact that your explanations of Forge theories don't mesh with my own understanding of them, don't really inure me to check out your game.<br/><br/>Most gamers do not know what The Forge is (was), and the majority of those who do left the fighting over it behind many years ago. If your justification for your choice of rules terminology (which, I assume, was the actual point, but I can't even be sure of that) is that you think that using specialized terms makes you part of a cult, then 1) you probably could have come up with a much more concise way of saying that, and 2) many other games (as well as most focused fields of interest) suddenly have a whole lot to answer for.<br/><br/>They're your opinions and your entitled to them, obviously. It just seems to me that you're drudging up ancient history, and indirectly attacking a lot of people who have contributed a lot to gaming, all for the sake of promoting your game. A decade ago, positioning yourself as anti-Forge might have won you a lot of support. Nowadays it strikes me as awkward, at best; like when someone complains about popular music and then cites bands that nobody listens to anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459956/#Comment_459956" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-05T23:03:15+00:00" title="February  5, 2017 11:03PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2017 11:05PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>[My] game uses a presentation similar to some Story Games (because it helps get the ideas across), and people were making big assumptions about the game, and about me</blockquote>This is a position I often find myself in.

Or just ask me, "What's your game about?" and judge my rant about character-POV supernatural discovery on its own merits.<br/><br/>The Forge didn't give me any of the specific techniques I use in my fantasy game, but it did hammer home a few important points like "for victory to matter, failure must be a possibility" and "if you care about the play experience, consider the players, not just the characters."  Forget the Hippie Story Game -- anyone who wants to make the best traditional or old-school RPG they can make is quite likely missing out if they've never browsed the core ideas of the Forge.\n<blockquote>I address the main question I've been getting, but also a few questions about "why" I'm doing the game.

The two ways in which this comes up is in making assumptions about my play (because everybody has to always play in one way only, apparently, so once you know that I'm Forge-born you can deduce everything about my play from that), and in appropriation-hate: some people seem to think that it is thoroughly disgusting for somebody to be playing another tribe's games without first making some sort of a grand disavowal of their previous allegiances.<br/><br/>Unlike David, I haven't particularly tried to shake the Forgite associations, though. Call me stubborn, but I don't like having other people decide for me what's relevant to my artistic identity and what's not. It remains a fact that I owe most of the good things in my roleplaying to the Forge, and I am uncertain as to whether I would still be in the hobby at all without it.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I am not particularly fond of the identity politics in rpgs. Just like in wider society, the labels applied to people fail to reflect complex reality, while they certainly do their work in providing false divisions, stereotypic assumptions and tribal hate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459963/#Comment_459963" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T01:00:17+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  1:00AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've now read the blog post. I found it a somewhat entertaining read, but, like others here, I was completely clueless as to why you were bringing up the particular topics. It seems like you're promoting your game (which sounds like an excellent thing to do!), but then also making strong claims that it's NOT certain things ("It's not a Story Game, I swear!"), which doesn't make any sense at all outside of the context of your friends' Facebook questions (or whatever conversation it was we're not privy to), and then some criticisms of the Forge. The criticisms have some validity, I think - you're not alone in saying that the culture there felt somewhat elitist or exclusionary. <br/><br/>Having said that, I'm with other posters here: I only ever encountered friendly, open, helpful people. Any appearance of "cultish" behaviour was usually (again, in my experience; I can't speak for the totality of the Forge membership) just given off by a group of people who knew each other and were friends getting rather deep into their own discussions. I can't really imagine how you can have years of in-depth discussions *without* doing that (at least, not productively). This is pretty much what Eero said, above.<br/><br/>For instance, when newcomers appeared at the Forge and started trying to explain things in the "Forge jargon", they would usually fail miserably. What I saw happen after that was "regulars" coming in and saying, "Hey, that's confusing and you don't need to talk like that. Want to just tell us what your issue is in plain English? Then we'll have a better shot at helping you out." This did not seem "cult-like" to me. The emphasis was on clarity and on helping people play or design better, not on "indoctrinating" anyone.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459964/#Comment_459964" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T01:05:32+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  1:05AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Overall, I will say this:<br/><br/>As someone who was not privy to your earlier discussions, your game pitch would be FAR more appealing to me if you didn't present it by:<br/><br/>a) Telling me what it is NOT. (Instead, sell me on its strong points! Tell me what it does well, what it's about, and what makes it unique.)<br/><br/>or <br/><br/>b) Talking poorly about any particular group of people, especially one that isn't around anymore to "defend itself". It doesn't matter if your criticisms are valid or not; I think there are better ways to promote your game than by slandering others, whether they be fellow gamers, people of another skin colour, or some other group.<br/><br/>I found your review of the 70's sci-fi game much more intriguing, in comparison. I would check that out if I saw it somewhere! The premise is great and the cover is beautiful.<br/><br/>Your comments on cult behaviour are interesting. Did I read accurately that you plan to start an online discussion group about your game? And that you want to make efforts to keep it from becoming or appearing "cult-like"?<br/><br/>That's a very positive goal to strive for, I think, and I support it fully. However, you don't say anything about *how* you will achieve this, or what behaviours or attitudes you recommend to others. Again, just talking about how another community *failed* in this respect (in your eyes) doesn't give me anything interesting or useful to think about. I'd rather hear about good ways to do this better now, today, and how you will go about it. If I learn something I can apply to my gaming or my everyday life, all the better. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan" title="Rskennan"><img alt="Rskennan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan">Rskennan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459966/#Comment_459966" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T05:03:09+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  5:03AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Blog post was not my pitch.

I'm not distancing myself from Story Games, I was trying to address the baggage of people who would prefer I did.  I used an enhanced version of my real opinion to try to do the job. I know the Forge fight is old, and dead, but its ghost lives on in a certain segment of my potential audience. I do feel a need to distance myself from perceptions that won't help. <br/><br/>I hope you're not mad at me for not fully explaining this, but I was wondering how well I did my job. There were a few people who saw what I was trying to do, but I could have done a lot better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan" title="Rskennan"><img alt="Rskennan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan">Rskennan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459968/#Comment_459968" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T05:30:10+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  5:30AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last bits and bobs.

This is probably because most gamers couldn't care less about high-order philosophy of gaming, while they do care about having a clear and usable game. I've yet to see a game fail by ignoring the tribalities; they are vocal, but ultimately nobody needs to court the Forgistas or anti-Forgistas or OSR grognards or Nordic freeformers or similar fringe groups to find an audience.<br/><br/>It occurs to me that the story about your mystical struggles with kabbalah, while being exactly the sort of weirdness the story gaming crowd eats up, might not sell so well with more traditional gamers. When you get to developing your marketing communication, you might wish to tone down the weirdness, if your target audience consists of mostly trad gamers - they're not called "traditional" for no reason <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan" title="Rskennan"><img alt="Rskennan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan">Rskennan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459973/#Comment_459973" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T06:35:24+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  6:35AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am toning down the weirdness.

What I was saying had nothing to do with the feelings of either side, it was simply that maybe people would silly the silliness of the claim when it was reframed and directed at the forge or story games (because I am assuming people who play these things or who were at the forge know intuitively that they are not in a cult, just like people who play old D&amp;D know it isn't a fascist game). I was saying the original claim was pretty ridiculous and vague by way of tying it to a list of things and constantly equivocating on the literary meaning of fascism and the political meaning. Then it just went into crazy territory when you start offering people a dubious cure for fascism in the form of an RPG. To me it just felt like people were asserting things, occasionally backing it up because other people had once asserted things.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459988/#Comment_459988" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T16:49:16+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  4:49PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [I think we should keep the "fascism" discussion to the other thread - no need to confuse things.]<br/><br/>Rskennan,<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I'm with David and Eero.

And Ron's brain damage article was from 2006, I think. Let it go. Move on.<br/><br/>Some people got a lot out of the discussion that happened on the Forge. Some people thought it was all bullshit. That's fine.<br/><br/>I think you're going to a lot of effort to distance yourself from something that not that many people ever knew about, or still care about, and by bringing it up so much, you're closing that distance unintentionally.<br/><br/>Imagine if I spent an hour telling you how much I was OVER my ex-girlfriend. And how I have this new girlfriend and she's not like my old girlfriend, who I'm totally OVER, if I didn't mention it.<br/><br/>That's the impression I get.<br/><br/>A word on jargon. I think the jargon of the Forge served to make a lot of the site's conversations possible, and at the same time, made it harder for people to get into it. We were developing a lot of new ideas and we attached words to them, and those new uses of those words had very specific meanings. Worse, we'd change the meanings of those words as our understanding changed, too. There wasn't a great central repository of Forge knowledge, because the site was mostly a collection of conversations in time, not a teaching tool.<br/><br/>I was one of the people who railed against the jargon (and models) without a good teaching tool. A lot of people told me, "Well, write one." Of course, you can't write one without understanding it. But over 5-8 years of conversations, and slowly re-reading older threads, I began to understand Forge ideas pretty well, and bought into some of it. And I realized there was just too much to really codify in a single document, and the handful of documents that already did exist were halfway decent starters, but that the Forge stuff was probably doomed to be a long conversation and not a text book.<br/><br/>But that's where it belongs. That's all it was. Conversations and ideas in motion. It wasn't much of a body of theory. It was useful to a lot of the people who dug into it, and folks produced some cool games that were different than the games of the time. And it helped a bunch of us play all kinds of games better -- at least at our tables.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460000/#Comment_460000" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T19:45:04+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  7:45PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2017 7:45PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"The term \u201cStory Game\u201d, I believe, was coined by former Forge member, Clinton R.

I can provide a link for this one if you need it.</blockquote>\nPlease do, because 'player agency' is one of the clearest and least jargony descriptors for a game related thing we have.\n<blockquote>Though I prefer a more traditional style, I'm open to Story Game elements in my personal games.</blockquote>\nWhat does this even mean?\n<blockquote>I want my game to be a sort of crossover engine between these two main styles, so I need to know how to appeal to both, at least by showing the game's potential.</blockquote>\nWhy?\n<blockquote>I was insensitve to one potential half of the audience in favor of the other half.</blockquote>\nHow?\n<blockquote>I guess I just thought that game theorists were intellectual about it all, and might see right through it.</blockquote>\nWho?\n<blockquote>The only thing that strikes me as a bummer is the perpetuation of this idea that there's some sort of conflict between people who make/play/read more traditional RPGs and people who make/play/read less traditional RPGs.  I really wish that would go away.</blockquote>\nSo do I. But considering how <a href="/forums/profile/Rskennan">@Rskennan</a> has continued with their beliefs despite all the evidence to the contrary, I don't have high hopes for that.\n<blockquote>[I think we should keep the "fascism" discussion to the other thread - no need to confuse things.]</blockquote>\nAgreed. But that's the problem with discussions like that: They tend to bleed into and contaminate surrounding discussions.\n<blockquote>My inclination would be to advise you to write the game you want, and let people's prejudices sort themselves out. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nThis hobby is really too small and intimate for anything else <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan" title="Rskennan"><img alt="Rskennan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan">Rskennan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460014/#Comment_460014" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-07T05:35:38+00:00" title="February  7, 2017  5:35AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't reply to all of the above, but I took the post down.

Sometimes it refers to games focused on story, and sometimes all RPGs. For example, the rules and purpose sticky thread for this forum defines the term as: \n<blockquote><b>What is a Story Game?</b><br/><br/><b>Story Games...</b> is the name of this website/forum, dedicated to the discussion of playing Role-Playing Games.<br/><br/><b>A Story Game...</b> is another word for A Role-Playing Game. Defined as "A game where you play a role". This covers a lot, A LOT, of ground.<br/><br/>Most of the games we discuss are tabletop roleplaying games, much more than live action roleplaying, or computer/console gaming (not the focus of the site).<br/><br/>While all role-playing games are kosher to talk about here at Story Games, you'll probably see a lot of discussion focused towards smaller press games, or "dirty hippie games", like roleplaying games that focus more on relationships, or story-building, or on "our story" over "my character". That's cause there's not a lot of other places to discuss those sorts of things, so folks interested in that tended to gravitate here: Beyond that, exploring cool new ways to play any sort of game is a welcome topic here. The lesser-known games we discuss here often are no more important or "better" than other games or game styles (adventure games, etc). Nor by definition must the games we discuss here contain certain rules or playstyles, emphasis or de-emphasis on a central game-master, light/crunchy rules, etc. <br/><br/>Story Gamers are not better. We are not the Chosen Ones. We simply do things a little differently.</blockquote>\nNote that there is some tension in saying that story gamers do things differently - which could imply that someone who plays traditional RPGs in a traditional way is not a story gamer and hence their RPG is not a story game. <br/><br/>Similarly, "indie games" sometimes refers to independently developed games - where the content is written by the owners rather than by freelance writers. However, it also sometimes would refer to games that are of the Forge esthetics - partly because The Forge is "indie-rpgs.com" and bills itself as "The Internet Home for Independent Role-Playing Games".                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460039/#Comment_460039" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-07T18:27:05+00:00" title="February  7, 2017  6:27PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I'd echo Eero's comments that I'd be interested to hear more about your game, Rskennan.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_460134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460134/#Comment_460134" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-11T15:56:12+00:00" title="February 11, 2017  3:56PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Also, I'd echo Eero's comments that I'd be interested to hear more about your game, Rskennan.</blockquote>\nThirded.<br/><br/>And this is what disappoints me most about our politically charged climate.

This goes back to the fundamentals of what it means to be human among other humans: emotions inherent to human-monkeys, self-control and self-understanding learned as a child, and social skills that built upon those. While there is a variety of coping strategies that adults develop for these situations, the variety is also pretty predictable once you've observed humanity for a while: some people swing this way, some swing that way, some start an artistic school and others throw rocks at its windows.<br/><br/>An important observation in understanding the phenomenon is that it is nothing special to roleplaying: <i>every</i> last form of art has similar internal social dynamics, both in history and present day. I believe this to be caused by the particular way artistic enthusiasm, feelings of ownership and social affirmation of expertise play out in an artistic setting: a person who loves their art and yearns for affirmation as an expert of the field will naturally feel resentment towards anybody else they perceive to be competing for the same social niche - in this case the niche of the "rpg guru", or however you'd want to term it. There is only so much attention to go around in a given social setting, after all.<br/><br/>Not everybody reacts to recognizing a potential guru with hostility, but there are always some in a sufficiently large population. Some have these feelings (because they'd also like to be gurus themselves) but fail to react with hostility, possibly because they give up out of timidity, or because they're self-conscious enough to get out of that mind-set, or because they're hierarchy-minded and don't mind expressing their own guruship by subordinating themselves to the other guru. Others will indeed react to a potential guru by showcasing themselves as alternate gurus, but there is wide leeway for humans in how they express this: it doesn't <i>need</i> to be in blind hostility, many rpg gurus adopt a "live and let live" attitude towards others they perceive to be striving for a similar social position. Still, as long as we have naturally grown human individuals, it's likely that we'll continue having people who choose empire-building and competitive guruship as their social reaction.<br/><br/>All this is a thoroughly common experience for anybody with an artistic hobby, such as roleplaying. Thinking back, I think the last time I felt threatened by another person's bid for social credit was a couple months back when a player in our D&amp;D campaign expressed a sudden desire to run some <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> for the group: he was, in a certain primitive monkey-sphere sense, co-opting my group of followers and undermining my guruship, my position as the deliverer of play. I have much too much social discipline and virtues of various sorts for this sort of thing to end up in a poo-flinging monkey tantrum, of course, but the psychology is precisely the same as the one that makes a person form a strong emotional attachment to resisting other people's roleplaying in the Internet.<br/><br/>I think that the best kernel of wisdom I have to offer about this phenomenon is that understanding it helps a lot in dealing with it in both yourself and others: if you understand that the other guy becomes angry and snide about your gaming because they care and love their hobby so much, and because they just might be a bit insecure in how they feel about their own position of expertise, it should also become easier to maintain your own calm and empathy towards them. This might not help you make friends, because some people actively need that antagonism as part of their identity makeup (giving it up would be much too scary to do just because you're being friendly or whatever), but it is an achievement of humanity to maintain your own calmness and empathy even where the other party to the interaction fails. Definitely worth it, even if the other guy wants and needs the fight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460183/#Comment_460183" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-13T14:33:16+00:00" title="February 13, 2017  2:33PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>the other guy becomes angry and snide about your gaming because they care and love their hobby so much, and because they just might be a bit insecure in how they feel about their own position of expertise</blockquote>Yeah.  As long as people have been wanting things out of RPGs, those things have often been genuinely difficult to identify, discuss, and reliably achieve.  So of course some people will claim expertise, and of course other people will rally to them, or try to knock them down a peg, or try to beat them at the "expertise" game.<br/><br/>Forgite claims to expertise were different than immersionist or grognard claims to expertise, and this difference provided natural enemies for anyone who was looking for them.  The Forge's frequent focus on understanding the "real people" levels of play, e.g. "social contract", is easy to see as pretentious or threatening to those who claim expertise over only a certain subset of that domain.  Try telling a gamer who's spent their whole gaming career pursuing better and better immersion that, "Immersion's never the full story of a successful session and there are other things that need to be in place before you can even hope to achieve it and it's important to talk about <i>those</i> things," and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_460188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460188/#Comment_460188" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-13T17:32:42+00:00" title="February 13, 2017  5:32PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>he was, in a certain primitive monkey-sphere sense, co-opting my group of followers and undermining my guruship, my position as the deliverer of play.
