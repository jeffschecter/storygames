I liked that game.  A lot.  It probably wasn't quite my favorite of the Old WoD, but it was up there, and I was disappointed when it went away.  I was shocked enough (though pleased) at an nWoD version of Changeling, and I don't really expect to see similar treatment of Wraith anytime soon.<br/><br/>Besides, I'm mature enough these days to admit that what I liked about it wasn't the GAME part of the game.  It was the setting, the theme, the mood.  The fact that the PCs are <i><b>ghosts</b></i> for fuck's sake!  oWoD mechanics were pretty crap.  the new stuff is better, i think, but even if i wanted to mess around trying to do some kind of conversion... well, that sounds like more trouble than it's worth.<br/><br/>so i thought i'd ask the good, smart, crazy people over here on SG what system they would use to run a Wraith-style game.<br/>and as i was thinking that, i thought...<br/><br/>Maybe Polaris?<br/>As long as everyone is willing to play a game where it is a <i>given</i> that all the PCs will eventually succumb to Oblivion, it seems like this could work, and possibly quite well.  the system is certainly flexible in terms of powers and abilities and all that crap.  it leaves things fluid and focused on the story, which is where a game based around a bunch of dead people should probably be, if you ask me.  plus, one of the trickier but also more interesting parts about Wraith was the Shadow.  No problems there if you do it through Polaris's system.  The Mistaken can handle that role just fine.  In fact, the Mistaken player role probably could/should be renamed to the Shadow in that case.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm curious to hear what anyone else thinks.  Think the Polaris idea is crazy-talk?  If so, or even if not, what system would work well for doing a Wraith-y game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147799/#Comment_147799" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T18:45:12+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  6:45PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2008 6:52PM by Jesse.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wraith is one of the two White Wolf games I actually understood.  Your idea of using Polaris to imitate the Shadow idea is a good one.  However, to me the most interesting part of Wraith was the Fetters -- Addressing the question: Why the hell are you still here?  Or the errie flip side that: To the dead, the living might as well have been the ones who died.<br/><br/>Which made me think it might be interesting to play It Was A Mutual Decision but replace the Wererat stuff with ghost stuff.  Such that you end up having a kind of a twist ending effect where one or both members of the couple might in fact, be DEAD, which totally retro-colors all the previous scenes and draws a parallel between breaking up romantically and letting go of someone after they're gone.  Speculating on at what point in the story the character must have died might be half the fun.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147800/#Comment_147800" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T19:00:00+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  7:00PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I never said I thought THE most interesting part of Wraith was the Shadow.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  just that it was both interesting and tricksy.

The alternative was to just keep playing.  As long as you didn't succumb to Oblivion the game went on.  Which kind of harshed on all the other thematic material in the game and was hamstrung by the assumptions that all games are designed for never ending campaigns.<br/><br/>Polaris at least has two outcomes, Death or Demon and then a rather broad range of material surrounding what those outcomes MEAN.  So in addition to succumbing to Oblivion (probably the equivalent of the Demon outcome) I would want some other out, some other kind of conclusion.

I think at the turn over to "Veteran" the wraith has aged and felt the taint of Oblivion, eventually giving up the connection to the world of the living, and possibly leaving the Shadowlands all together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148184/#Comment_148184" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T16:25:02+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  4:25PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            also, re: Transcendence v.

As a player you can describe it that way, but the Wraith doesn't have any way to know that it's going to be what he hopes it is.

Strength and Intelligence can't really be quantified that way either.  Niether can a ghost's "connection" to say The House I Grew Up In.<br/>But I also see what you're saying, and it would probably work just fine to roll Fetters and Passions together into the Aspects.  On the other hand, keeping them separate allows for some interesting things, like having a ghost strangely tied to a place he doesn't feel any real connection to, at least on a conscious level.
