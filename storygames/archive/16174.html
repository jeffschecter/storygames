One of the troubles I found with my group was that being most of them unexperienced GMs, there was a sort of creative block syndrome when it came to framing interesting scenes. On top of that I also wanted to play and I wanted the game to surprise me with interesting challenges. Oh, and I didn't wanted to prep, I'm still going for that lazy goal.<br/><br/>So I started making random tables to frame as much different situations I could came up with, but then it became cumbersome to roll a lot of dice and look up in the tables to create something. It took too much game time just to frame one part of the scene.<br/><br/>Then I stumbled upon the <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/systemdesign/cards/whimsycards.html" rel="nofollow">whimsy cards</a> and hacked a game out of them that did quite good a part of what I was looking for, though players still had if not a complete block, at least they needed some extra time to frame the scenes, in the worst case.<br/><br/>So I ended up creating this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/P1020333.jpg"/><br/><br/>Sorry, it's in spanish, but let me explain what you're seeing here.<br/><br/>This is a sample of a deck of 60 cards. On each one are 7 fields of information. Whenever you draw a card, you only choose one of those 7 options to frame the main element of the scene. This deck has been made with a fantasy setting in mind, so you would need to change some words to fit other settings better.<br/><br/>The information on each card is this:<br/>-Top: things that could be find up the road (a place, monster, NPC or an object)<br/>-Bottom: emotions and other mental features<br/>-Sides: physical characteristics<br/>-Diagonal: phrases from the whimsy cards<br/>-spaces between: elements (for magic) and tactical advantages (position, initiative, terrain, speed, etc)<br/><br/>Basically it works like this:<br/>1-Draw three cards. Advanced rules can use more or less, but for the example 3 would be enough.<br/>2-Choose one of the 7 options in each card<br/>3-Make sense out of your choice.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/P1020337.jpg"/><br/>translates as a "bright illusory place" Which can be a blinding Temple of Ilusions, that turns into a never ending maze for the usual unexpected visitor. Or just a place with a bright illusion if you're not specially inspired that day. Which still can be kind of interesting, depending on how the player interpretates it (you can always do the witch mountain trick on them)<br/><br/>Also this:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/P1020336.jpg"/><br/>can be translated as a "small elemental monster" which can be a magma jelly, a young phoenix, a salamander (hey, it can be a whole bunch of them running through your campfire in stampede) so you see, the possibilities are endless. And I still haven't used the whimsy cards part yet. <br/><br/>I would llike to dare you find what's terribly wrong here with this randomizer, what kind of menace it represents to RPGs in general, and of course, I would like to know how may before me came with a similar idea any why I haven't heard of them yet.<br/><br/>T\xc3\xa4hti doesn't count, I designed this before knowing of it and the feeling and philosophy of design is completely different. I also readed an article of a similar game based on a variant of tarot cards, but again, the feeling is different since the interpretation in both games mentioned is more open.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368748/#Comment_368748" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-21T02:37:02+00:00" title="March 21, 2012  2:37AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are neat!

These cards come with a game where:<br/><br/>-All players create the world together answering half a dozen questions and adding at least one element each (but you can add more if you want)<br/>-You start creating your character stating what do you want her story to be about. If you get enough plot points and don't sacrifice the most important things for you character liberally, you get what you wanted in the first place. But even if you don't, things can resolve in an interesting way.<br/>-Characters are built on a system loosely based on a mix between Fate, DitV and AW, with only 5 stats (hacked from the basic AW moves) that you fill with either common human abilities, skills, items, special powers, etc. etc. <i>a la</i> DitV. So the system can handle basically anything you want in a more or less balanced way.<br/>-Anything you put on your character sheet can become a part of a challenge, instead of a card. So you can have an scene where the challenge is that your main power fails or your sword breakes... in the middle of a fight.<br/>-3 card challenges are but the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">first level</span>. It escalates usually one card at a time each turn. However other players can complicate the challenge by adding one card from their own hand.<br/><br/>BTW Peter, in playtest I found it still takes players about 10 minutes for the less inspired/more tired ones to find a good/viable connection of 3 random words. You can also hold your last card until the player states her first reaction and rolls the dice, to add a complication to the challenge. On top of that, you can always rely on the group to help you complete the scene and bring it to life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368850/#Comment_368850" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-21T19:00:43+00:00" title="March 21, 2012  7:00PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love these kinds of tools, I have three tarot decks and a Gamemastery Plot Twist deck for things like this.

"Almost" means I'll see how to make it a kickstarter project for $500, and once finished I'll upload the whole thing as a PDF on a free blog. I have no way to make publicity for it right now, other than spamming it in this forum. And of course I've got no way to attend Cons anywhere but Peru, since:<br/><br/>1- The EEUU embassy already denied me the tourist visa once and I still don't seem to fit in the requirements they ask.<br/>2- Travelling up there would probably rise the cost of the project at least to $2500 <br/>3- I'll already be knee-dip in work here, introducing a whole country into RPGs.<br/><br/>The good part is that the project is gonna be this cheap because I won't be printing anything but some rewards for supporters and I can do all the art myself, though it's gonna take me a while. Being responsible with it I'll only begin with the kickstarter once the whole art is ready and everything is translated. I even feel guilty for charging $500 for it so I'll try to make my best to make the material worth that price. You feel ok with this? This would be a good moment to drop any comments, complaints or advice you have about this.

These ones empower a player to apply a new specific rule, to his character or when framing an scene for other player(s). In the playtests I've seen how important is to keep the pace of the game changing from time to time. <br/><br/>You can start by letting a player state where is her character and what is doing and then use the cards to add a conflict in that scene. Then you can keep adding challenges and have the players just react. But after a while you'll find is neccesary to shift the gears. You can stage an event that happens everywhere in the setting and have each PC face it alone. You can interrupt the game to let the players take the lead and frame an scene where they get one step closer to their goal, or where they get to state what's really going on and roll to see if their hypothesis is true.<br/><br/>I was thinking from the beggining of several ways to allow players change the pace of the narration. I don't thing this would compensate the absence of a GM but could help less experienced GMs to introduce variations to keep the story interesting.<br/><br/>I'm definitely going for Game Crafter, so the fund rising still doesn't seem to be a necessity. BTW, the icons for the elements are finished, now I've gotta design the card layout.

I'm still translating the phrases in the middle of the cards, it's coming kind of slow yet. However my pals here had this couple crazy ideas for two settings:<br/><br/>First one is loosely based on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMEhkTxs3_E" rel="nofollow">Pandorum</a> with the twist that on their turn players PCs are the repairing drones of the ship. While they have a humanoid body, they are fitted with the proper tools for their specific work, which can be security, hardware fixing, software fixing, medic, etc. On other players turn, they play the part of one of the main AI of the ship: communications, engineering, navigation, life support, security, etc. They get to feed the active droid with data and give them tasks, which some times could be conflctive and it's left to the individual AIs of the drones to decide relevance of the tasks.<br/><br/>A.I.s start with three cards to frame situations for the active droid. However randomly, one or more of these cards could be corrupted data or a virus, meaning the AI could become unresponsive at the worse moment or going nuts and following the directive overwritten by the virus. At the end of the turn of all droids, all cards are reshuffled, meaning AIs exchange data. 3 more cards of new data are then added to the shared database which is again split among all AIs. This leaves players to start getting paranoid about which AI is infected now, or if they are infected at all, since it could happen that the virus cards won't appear until later in the game.<br/><br/>Droids will even get the chance to shut off one of the AIs on their turn, freezing the data flow in an attemp to stop the virus actions. But this won't happen without consequences...<br/><br/>GTG, I'll post something about the other setting later!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370562/#Comment_370562" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-02T05:15:22+00:00" title="April  2, 2012  5:15AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anybody interested in helping me with the translation of this game to make it faster?

I'm done with the twist phrases and the top side of the cards, this is the list of descriptors on the sides:<br/><br/>sagrado, destructivo, oscuro, imparable, hostil, r\xe1pido, riesgoso, aterrador, hermoso, elemental, innaccesible, elemental, humedo, org\xe1nico, t\xf3xico, seguro, fuerte, extra\xf1o, maldito, dorado, venenoso, flotante, pegajoso, alerta, blindado, estrecho, embrujado, infernal, antinatural, glorioso, violento, ominoso, polvoriento, muerto, miserable, mistico, seguro, cambiante, inestable, resistente, salvaje, ruinoso, derrumbado, espinoso, inundado, destruido, legendario, veloz, peque\xf1o, gigantesco, interminable, ensangrentado, tenebroso, cadav\xe9rico, sorpresivo, inaccesible, extremo, enterrado, sobrecogedor, sobrenatural, corrosivo, plateado, met\xe1lico, falso, elevado, agil, subterr\xe1neo, enmara\xf1ado, luminoso, oculto, infestado, paralizante, concurrido, contaminado, retorcido, infernal, protegido, poderoso, electrificado, profundo, importante, acorazado, petrificado, inmundo, descomunal, antiguo, grande, explosivo, vigilado, enjoyado, insalubre, afilado, fino, pobre, horripilante, fragante, r\xe1pido, mohoso, fuerte.<br/><br/>Bear in mind that the words in this list are suppossed to help create a medieval fantasy setting. Monsters themselves will be created by the players with these words as inspiration, so I won't include things like "orc" or "dragon". It goes the same with specific places, objects and characters. However the characteristics or any details of those could be added.<br/><br/><br/>I made another list for the emotions/mental characteristics, which will be located on the bottom side of the card. These ones are:<br/><br/>Demencia, calma, tristeza, arrogancia, miedo, l\xe1stima, odio, enojo, ira, alegr\xeda, cobard\xeda, amor, crueldad, cautela.<br/><br/>Many thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372254/#Comment_372254" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T18:35:27+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  6:35PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            holy, destructive, dark, relentless, hostile, fast, risky, terrifying, beautiful, inaccessible, elementary, damp, organic, toxic, safe, strong, strange, accursed, gilded, poisonous, floating, sticky, alert, shielded, narrow, haunted, infernal, unnatural, glorious, violent, ominous, dusty, dead, miserable, mystical, forbidding, changing, unstable, tough, wild, ruinous, collapsed, thorny, flooded, destroyed, legendary, quick, small, gigantic, endless, bloody, scary, cadaverous, unexpected, inaccessible, extreme, buried, startling, supernatural, corrosive, metallic, false, elevated, agile, subterranean, matted, bright, hidden, infested, paralyzing, bustling, polluted, twisted, hellish, cyclopean, powerful, electrified, profound, important, monstrous, petrified, nasty, huge, ancient, massive, explosive, vile, bejeweled, unhealthy, spined, emaciated, poor, horrifying, fragrant, hurried, musty, strong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372259/#Comment_372259" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T20:15:14+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  8:15PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.

I'll be back working on the layout tomorrow. However it's not like I've been doing nothing, I've been adjusting the character sheet (which is also the GM screen) and designing and working on a horror version of the game.<br/><br/>The first draft of the horror game used a similar deck to throw everyday problems to the players. Well, everyday problems <i>with something really strange in them.</i> Like an argument with your fiancee because she borrowed you her car and now the inside looks like a couple of huge racoons teared it apart.<br/><br/>In the first part of the game, the players task is to find an explanation for these strange events. One that doesn't involve creatures from beyond our realm because, you know, even you would doubt of your sanity if you have to admit that. Of course, the more you fail to find good explanations, the more you believe in something and start giving shape and powers to it. And the more stress you accumulate, which in turn makes your reactions more and more extreme. Until the point where the thing is so real for you that it starts showing itself and attacking you and the things most dear to you, corrupting, destroying or even just making you push them away from you, which is what the second part of the game is about.<br/><br/>Initial testing went quite good for the first part, but we have to work more on the mechanics and word lists for the second part of the game. Anyway I'll put it aside for a while and get the original game finished. More on this later!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372509/#Comment_372509" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-12T06:00:57+00:00" title="April 12, 2012  6:00AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, 80% of the layout is done, now I've got to translate the Emotions list, set those in place and it would be ready for playtesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moleculo" title="moleculo"><img alt="moleculo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/874/n4G37MA34HKP8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moleculo">moleculo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372532/#Comment_372532" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-12T09:52:09+00:00" title="April 12, 2012  9:52AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm ready to give you money right now just to inspire you to finish these, Paulo.

They found that just using one card to frame the scene is more than enough if the PCs have enough plot behind them, which the system we were using provided with no trouble. I'll make the use of more than one card optional in my game, but anybody could use this tool the way they feel it's the best for their game.

Most cards printed nicely the first time, except for a few ones where some letters were misplaced. That's fixed now.<br/><br/>On other news we made another playtesting yesterday using BARBAREN (at least in spirit) and it went totally hilarious. We all used totally stupid-cartoony-barbarian names for our skills (My archery skill was called Axe, and my morning star was called Chelsea) Since most scenes were short and simple, we could write a one-liner at the end of each scene describing what happened. Once we filled the space in the back of our character's sheet we played the last scene, wrote the last one liner and then sung it as the worst barbarians bards could do.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not going to hack Barbaren, but this gave me ideas for making a game from a <a href="http://monjeguerrero.wordpress.com/el-elenco/" rel="nofollow">comic</a> I'm actually publishing through my company. The characters are already a success here, so making a tabletop game that could reproduce scenes from the comic on the table will certainly find it's place among our readers. I've gotta make up more silly names for the characters special techniques and redesign de whole deck for this but it's definitely worth the shot ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374242/#Comment_374242" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T13:42:43+00:00" title="April 24, 2012  1:42PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2012 2:47PM by WarriorMonk.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm working on some procedures to use this deck now. Our group is interested in playing Pathfinder, but nobody wants to GM full time, so I came up with this:<br/><br/>1) We determine the place drawing 2 cards for descriptors and one for element. That could get us for example: empty, inaccesible, nature. So I went up for "The trail ends in a deep part of the jungle, where trees and bushes grow too thick for us to keep going. We may need to find some other way to cross this part of the jungle." - Notice that I'm not stating any inmediate danger yet, not because of the "empty" card, but to prepare the scene better.<br/><br/>2) Then all players take a round stating "observations" This means they select one skill from their characters, roll fudge dice, and add one element to the scene according to the roll and skill selected. A "+" means their character spots something that could be useful, related with the skill they choosed. A "-" means they just found out one clue of something dangerous in the place, again, only related to the chosen skill. Still, since they spot it they can actually avoid it. And for each empty face they get to add1 to the CR of the next challenge, but what's the challenge gets defined only in the next step.<br/><br/>3) Draw 3 more cards. The red letters on the first one indicate what's the danger here: a monster, an object (either there or brought by the PCs) an NPC or the place itself. The other two help to describe it. You can instead use the same descriptors you got on the first set of cards, to keep the challenge on the same theme with the place created.<br/><br/>4) If the challenge is an NPC (or a group of them) one more card is drawn to set an emotion for these characters, if needed. Of course, there are more emotions than angry or hate among the deck, so the problem isn't always a fight; the group might find a tribe mourning one of their own so now the challenge may become a social one.<br/><br/>5) Players can always add elements of their own background into the scene when they add their observations: their nemesis could be involved in this situation, one of their relatives could be in danger, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Well, the "Object" card is still giving me some trouble. It could be a cursed altar, a magical weapon someone dropped or lost, a bridge about to collapse... but some of these could be related to challenges created with "the Place" card, so I'm wondering if I should delete that option from the deck or if I should be adding others.

Now the cards can also be used to frame specific events and create character's backgrounds <i>a la</i> Harrow deck, except my deck is less tarot-like and doesn't require you to know the meaning of all arcanas and stuff. It still uses one thing from tarot: if the card is upside down, it's something someone inflicted to you. If they come out in normal orientarion, it's something you inflicted on someone else.<br/><br/>For example, if you get "murder" upside down you can read it as "someone attempted to murder you" (not that it was succesful, unless you're playing a wraith character) if you get it in normal orientation, you can read it as "you murdered somebody". Of course, you can still draw cards to make up further details, unless you're already inspired or traumatized by the first card you've got <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385336/#Comment_385336" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-18T01:41:22+00:00" title="July 18, 2012  1:41AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just finished the second version of the deck (it's still in spanish, sorry) and the character sheet.

Thanks everyone for their input!<br/>-Replaced narrative twists with events<br/>-Added more elements: lightning, steel, death, ice, sand, rock, wood<br/>-Replaced tactical advantages with a list of conditions. Now creatures do more than just hurt you.<br/>-Adjusted and added a few more words on the list of emotions.<br/><br/>Character sheet is also simpler. And -at least in theory, yet- you can use any dice you want: d20, fudge, ORE, assign different dice sizes to any skill, equipment, etc. etc. You can even add a "3d6 personal army" as your weapon of choice, "2d6 diplomat" as your social skill, "1d6 web of espionage among merchants" as perception and play on a higher scale. The game can be guided by a GM or several, have players compete against each other or act as a group... anyway, I'll have to test it to see what else it can do.

However these could be combined in a single challenge.<br/>-Conditions in the cards should feature details about the effect they have in the mechanics, like a -1 to the roll, nullify certain types of actions, end the scene. That makes them more interesting.<br/>-Procedures for creating challenges could be simpler and thus, faster.<br/><br/>The character sheet also needs a lot of adjustments.<br/>-Types of actions will be already distributed in the sheet and explained. Players will only need to make/or choose 3, relate one to their story and will be able to pick the rest as the game progresses.<br/>-Physical Injuries will be limited to 12.<br/>-There will be a sort of injury gauge for social conflicts that affect how's the character perceived, but doesn't determine how the character and others will react every time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387093/#Comment_387093" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-14T13:34:34+00:00" title="August 14, 2012  1:34PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Had another playtest this sunday. I still need player's feedback but based on my own observations:<br/><br/>-There are still pieces missing from the game: creating the resources for the characters still takes a bit and players can get a blank page syndrome doing it. But a list of resources to choose from isn't enough, they have to be fun to use, and even on a miss these should do something more interesting. So I'm going to embark in another huge stage of work: creating another deck of cards for resources. This time each card will feature things like what does the resource in different levels and what happens on a miss, marginal success, complete success and critical miss, <i>a la</i> AW<br/><br/>-I can also turn the injuries into cards, and write there the conditions these impose on the PCs. Some injuries can even be turned into resources as well one the player buys it. For example, if your character loses a hand, you can later pay 4 story points to buy Hook as a resource.<br/><br/>These changes make resources more varied and interesting to use, reduce the time required to make characters and even make challenges more varied and interesting, since the GM also gets to use these resources for the challenges she will put the players through. It also makes the character sheet almost unnecessary.<br/><br/>T_T ok, now to hack/make up all the resources. I think to start I'll need:<br/>5 one-use resources<br/>15 or so skills<br/>8 or less physical advantages<br/>25 special/magical abilities<br/>20 common items<br/>20 wondrous items<br/>5 reputations<br/>8 NPCs                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399065/#Comment_399065" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T21:07:44+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  9:07PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2012 9:08PM by WarriorMonk.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Still toying with this. It almost turned it into a CCG with a complex mechanic, but then after a playtest I found that this wasn't the game I wanted to make, so I took a step back into a few previous stages of design. The current version of the game is again intended to be an RPG for newbies, either they are GMs or players. It must be easy to understand, require no prep but benefit from a heavy prep in the same way a trad RPG does.<br/><br/>The GM deck allows the GM to randomly frame scenes with three key ingredients: a situation, a challenge and a mood/emotion. Two adjectives can be applied also randomly to further define the scene. Then a single 2d6 roll provides for the challenge level. Players roll against this number a single 1d6 and add +1 for each card they have that helps them overcome the conflict. They reduce the challenge levelby 1 each time they roll over it or lose a resource every time they don't.<br/><br/>So players can try and push their luck to overcome the challenge and get a xp reward equal to the level of the challenge. They can cash it in the act for more cards and/or a single step towards their objective, which they get to create during the game. Players randomly get a card with a single word on it to define their objective, but they get to define and state it along the game. Whoever advances more steps to their objective is rewarded with levels, that allow him to make more complex moves, but also rises the minimum challenge level they face. Game progresses that way until players reach level 6, when they get to face the final challenge and fulfill their destiny or fall in the intent.<br/><br/>There are a few more mechanics I'd love to use but I also need to simplify the game. Most of the rules have to be in the cards or it won't work the way I'm planning. I also expect that the way I'm building it will allow players to hack it and make cards of their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399667/#Comment_399667" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-05T07:45:17+00:00" title="December  5, 2012  7:45AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GM's deck now looks really strange. It's got many interesting options, it can frame scenes out of nowhere complete with brief descriptions of places, npcs and monsters. Perhaps even items if the GM gets creative. It helps to add random events on those places and random emotional reactions for the characters present in the scene.<br/><br/>But the weirdest thing now is a copuple of mechanics added to the back of each card. One helps the players create motivations for their characters (it must be used in the beggining of the game and it can be used whenever a PC loses their motivation) The other helps the GM come up with a random consequence whenever the players beat or run from a challenge. Even I still don't know how will these work since everythig is quite open to the GM's and players interpretation and creativity to fill in the blanks.<br/><br/>Now the deck is up to 80 cards of pure chaos.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399751/#Comment_399751" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-05T20:10:44+00:00" title="December  5, 2012  8:10PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would you like to post the latest version?

relized I've gotta adjust a ton of stuff. So far it seems the final version of the deck will feature:<br/><br/>-A list of events<br/>-A list of focuses for challenges, currently it list just five things: A Person, Persons, A place, a Monster, Monsters. To adapt this to a new game idea I've got right now, I'll probably add Object back again, but I'm not sure yet.<br/>-A list of adjectives that help define objects, places and people. Two or three are usually enough to define what or who is on the scene.<br/>-Twelve drawings that feature different elements. It currently includes Illusion, but probably I'll be taking that out and add instead the adjective "illusory" to the list above.<br/>-A list of emotions. These have been the most useful stuff so far, it really helps a lot to bring life into a scene. I still gotta refine those, though.<br/>-A list of motivations. Some can be confused with emotions, but I really need to vahe these in separated lists.<br/>-A list of combat strategies. I'm still wondering if I can turn these into something that can also be used to define how a character would react in a social conflict. This would help a lot to simplify the deck.<br/>-A list of consequences. I still haven't tested these but they seem quite useful. Letting the players chose one at random certainly has a nice ring attached to it.<br/>-Numbers from 0-9, not much needed so far but they ain't so bad. These can even replace the dice.<br/><br/>Some things I'm planning to add:<br/>-A list of animals, in icons. These should be iconic animals, totem creatures that could be mentioned/used in magic. I'm not using mythological, but common animals instead.<br/>-A list of laws of magic, certain conditions a person should meet in order to make magic do something. Using these, the drawings of elements, emotions, and a couple other things, a GM should be able to add weird hellbazer-like spells and macGuffins to the game. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400843/#Comment_400843" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T11:54:08+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 11:54AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, serendipity. I've been working on a very similar project of my own (albeit for a more traditional play style). I even ended up making it a deck of 60 cards also, though in my case its because I'm including die-rolls on it and 60 is the sweet spot for every standard die type (except the d8, darnnit). <br/><br/>My deck is just broad single-phrase concepts, to be used tarot-like for on-the-spot inspiration (plus letters, time spans and the aforementioned dice for more concrete matters). I've also come up with abstract designs on the back so they can be used for random map generation at any scale (dungeon to continent).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream" title="daniel_ream"><img alt="daniel_ream" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream">daniel_ream</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400845/#Comment_400845" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T12:24:31+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 12:24PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a deck of these: <a href="http://www.thecards.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecards.com/</a>  although I must have an earlier printing because mine have pips on them.<br/><br/>I can't find a link or remember the name now, but I have a product at home that consists of four discrete decks of cards, each one with a different topic (character, setting, mood, and prop); each card has a short list of genre-neutral synonyms for a specific element.

Does using them to replace dice rolls affetcs probabilities of achieving something in the game? What kind of situations did those decks help you resolve?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401926/#Comment_401926" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-28T07:52:24+00:00" title="December 28, 2012  7:52AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 28, 2012 7:52AM by WarriorMonk.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now it's got so many lists and options, I'm using both sides of the cards. On one side are mostly lists of phisical stuff: the adjectives for places, objetcs, people and monsters; a list of weapons and a list of mundane objects (which now allows the deck to properly create a city, town or market by giving each important building a sign with an object painted in it and let players/gm figure what's the function of that place) along with the elemental drawings, the list of strategies and situations. Two new features appear now on the corners: a "yes, yes but... , yes and..." etc randomizer, and numbers from 0-9.<br/><br/>On the other side there's mostly mental stuff: a list of motivations and a list of emotions, the "type of challenge" randomizer, the relationship randomizer; a list of consequences and a list of laws of magic. <br/><br/>This last one has more to do with the setting for the game I'm planning but it can be used to generate interesting ways of doing magic as well. I still want to give it a feeling like "the Books of Magick" or th "Hellblazer" comics, in the sense that magic requires certain rituals that charge it with meaning, that the way it affects the world is closely related to that meaning, and that it comes with a price. The laws in the deck act as a limit and indications of how to make an spell, which can be totally different from player to player. The rest will have to come with the interpretation of the GM, who would have to make magic feel unwieldy and unpredictable but quite powerful. I hope it would be enough to add a few guidelines on how to interpretate magical effects.<br/><br/>In the setting, the players are free to ask whatever they want from magic, but are recommended (often too late) to be careful with whatever they wish for. For example, a person could perform a ritual to get a lot of money quickly, only to find the next day that her parents passed away and left her their inheritance. Another could craft a magical bow and find it linked to his person in such a way that whatever happens to the bow will happen to him, and though it can be used to punch a hole through a mountain, each time its used in such way it drains the life of the crafter (mechanically meaning that it could be used like, 6 times before the caster dies)<br/><br/>So the magick could be either too literal, way too much effective, work on a different target, have an unexpected side effect, use the closest resources available instead of creating anything, etc. etc. I prefer to put these as guidelines instead of adding them as a list to the deck not only for lack of space, but more because it will depend on specific situations and won't work too good if they were used at random.<br/><br/>And well, implementing all this in the deck is still being a pain and taking a lot of time, but I hope it will be worthy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403575/#Comment_403575" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-12T19:56:17+00:00" title="January 12, 2013  7:56PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, the 2.0 draft is ready!<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/P1020392_zps42f96316.jpg"/><br/><br/>Ok, sorry, it's in spanish but I really need to playtest this a lot first, before translating. Current version is now double-sided. One side features the adjectives, a list of weapons, a list of common objects, a list of events, a list of tactics, icons for elements which can either be used to describe places or for elemental magic. Or anything you can relate the pictures to, actually. There's also numbers from 0 to 9 and the infamous "yes", "yes, and..." "yes, but..." etc options, so if you ever wanted a dice with those options, here it is.<br/><br/>The other side has one list of challenges, one of motivations, one of relationships, one of emotions, syllabes to form random words and exotic names, a list of laws of magic (which sadly still doesn't produce the result I'm looking for, and will have to be reworked) and a list of things a GM can do to make the life of your character happier or totally miserable. I intend to let the players choose one randomly after they face the challenge, either if they win or not. Mostly to let the GM come clean after having the players pick their own poison, but also to keep them on the edge for whatever will result from their choice.<br/><br/>Let's see an example. So far the deck can produce random challenges in the form of NPCs, monsters or places just by adding two adjectives as shown in the picture. This one is a savage teleporting creature.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/P1020393_zpse1af4a37.jpg"/><br/><br/>Which we will call "the Cislanka"<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/P1020394_zpsb5b3b423.jpg"/><br/><br/>The next card stated that it will always attack the closest enemy, though you can make the creature change strategy in mid-battle if you feel it isn't enough fun.<br/><br/><a href="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/P1020395_zps4339617a.jpg" rel="nofollow">i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/P1020395_zps4339617a.jpg</a><br/><br/>You can also add a particular emotion, not to the creature but to the group. This card here states that the heroes face this challenge with enthusiasm rather than in fear or surprise. Perhaps it happens that the Cislanka is a good prey or, if you defeat it, it can be a sign that you can defeat anything. Well, at least your party morale is high.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/P1020396_zps3b5dd007.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403577/#Comment_403577" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-12T20:07:39+00:00" title="January 12, 2013  8:07PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's say the party slays the Cislanka.

I'm going with an idea I'm not yet sure how will work on play. The core stats are 6 ways to solve problems: By instinct, with violence, Ignoring it, Paying attention, Calmly and With knowledge, which are always played in this initiative order. Each way of solving problems gets a bonus from 1 to 3 and the same number of characteristics linked to it. <br/><br/>Notice that some ways of solving problems are opposite, it's on purpose: Players have to put the same number of bonuses as penalties for the opposite way of solving problems. So let's say your character mostly solves problems with violence, at a +3 she will probably find it easier to resort to violence to solve anything. Let's link it with the characteristics "strong", "agile" and "cunning" to make her a fearsome fighter; these characteristics now explain why she tends to draw a weapon whenever there's problems around. However this will also mean she has problems whenever she has to face problems Calmly. You'll have to put a -3 to Calmly and link it to 3 defects like "stubborn" "quick-tempered" and "happy trigger". Of course these will only give you trouble whenever your character needs to solve something calmly.<br/><br/>So, more than describing what your character can do, this system is dedicated to help players describe how their character actually accomplishes or fails at something.<br/><br/>There will also be skills and items, but these won't give exactly bonuses or penalties. Instead they allow the character to do something or not, and work as Reign's "master" and "expert" dice for the most trained skills.<br/><br/>The other part of the character that gives out bonuses is her Humanity, a collection of "Fate"-like Aspects involving relationships, fame, objectives, memories, enemies and everything that represents a passion for the character, all reasons why she gets in trouble. Certain magical effects in the game may stole memories from the character, which will mean these Aspects may get erased in play. Others will be solved, reached, broken and be forgotten, while new ones can appear, be forged or cultivated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406226/#Comment_406226" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T11:17:31+00:00" title="February 14, 2013 11:17AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2013 11:19AM by WarriorMonk.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the anatomy of the last ResourceFULL Deck iteration, with 16 lists of random stuff to create PCs, NPCs, monsters, combat tactics for them, weapons they carry, random medieval objects, places, names, quantities, relationships, emotions... you name it.

I couldn't sleep well after that, thinking in all the implications of that...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406339/#Comment_406339" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-15T15:21:17+00:00" title="February 15, 2013  3:21PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First playtest last night. I still can't believe it worked, and it worked in a totally different way than I thought. I was expecting the game to create an ordinary but familiar setting with a few interesting turns, like your usual medieval fantasy game. But suddenly the players ended up with very unique characters that wouldn't fit as adventurers in your usual game...<br/><br/>Besilofeno (player actually loved this randomly created name and snatched it from another player) was a son of a soldier who decided he actually wanted to be an actor and tinkerer. Dog (player refused to use the random generator, which is fine since it means they have a more defined idea of the character they want) was a beggar, son of a beggar and descendant from a great warrior clan fallen in disgrace, who only kept his honor but not the fighting instinct of his ancestors. And Swatko was the son of an artisan with dreams of becoming a soldier of fortune.<br/><br/>So I went with the idea that small characters fit better in a small story and created a relationship tree for a small town, added a corrupt religious cult as a front and kept adding NPCs and relationships among them and the players. And as a Mc guffin, the presence of a fat but nice bard who handed some magical tickets to the PCs, that were supposed to grant wishes.<br/><br/>A lot more parts of the story strangely came from the excuses the PCs had for their equipment, most of which came from the cards. The beggar had a pig, some milk from the animal and a rusty scimitar. He came up with the idea that he saved a merc from death and he was given the weapon in gratitude. I inmediatly linked that to the corrupt cult by adding a giant merc with a horned helm and bad attitude, who had beaten Susan, a nomad caravan guard and left her for his sidekick to dispose. The beggar saw this and killed the merc's sidekick, saving Susan.<br/><br/>Well, making it short, the good things were:<br/>- The Deck works! It kept the story flowing and added interesting and meaningful details; all I had to do was follow up, write things down and connect them later. Players noticed how easy their raw ideas were accepted, introduced in the story, completed with further detail and returned to kick them in the ass when least expected.<br/>- A relationship tree is the best tool to use with the deck, it's the easier and fastest way to keep track of everything and surprise the players with logical twists in the story. It also helps a lot to make the PCs more involved with the situation.<br/>-Players started separated and had one scene each, but the story helped to bring them together.<br/>-It's good to know exactly what kind of setting the game produces, now I can add things that fit better in it and finally have an idea of the art style the game should have.<br/><br/>Things that need fixing:<br/>-Character creation took 30 minutes but it should take less time. I'm simplifying some stats and procedures, and including more of that info in the character sheet so players can do it on their own.<br/>-Character objectives need to be more urgent and clear. Perhaps I'll modify that list of the deck just for this.<br/>-Magic is random, though not exactly in the way I wanted. But that's something I need to fix in the setting, not in the cards.<br/>-The skills need to be more clearly related to the core stats, which are being reduced to 4. Virtues will probably dissapear, since they saw no use in the game. Defects worked better and players collected rewards as soon as they mentioned them.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429562/#Comment_429562" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T07:51:03+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  7:51AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rise!<br/><br/>Ok, I've been testing the deck on several other games and while it worked wonders, I admit is still hard to handle the total randomness of the outcomes. The random magic didn't worked as I expected and in general, a lot of options were insufficient. On top of that, I crammed too much options on the last version, from which 3/4 were useless. Lastly, I've played a bit of OSR and haven't been able to get a copy of Whitehack (it's kinda difficult to get a printed copy in south america), so I'm hacking it from every speck of info I can find in the reviews.<br/><br/>Which took me back to the deck, wondering if I can automatize dungeon generation. I've been playing on steam this game, <a href="store.steampowered.com/app/239220/" rel="nofollow">Mighty Quest for Epic Loot</a> and a co-worker has been playing <a href="store.steampowered.com \u203a ... \u203a Orcs Must Die!" rel="nofollow">Orcs must Die</a>. Both games share this mechanics of setting traps mixing a really fun tactical component to them. Then I readed here about Hexacrawls and noticed how simple it could be to automatize this part of the game. Then I went back to the PF gamemastering guide and saw the NPC generation tables and remembered I had a similar table to create random monsters. Also, I readed again <a href="http://adam.legendary.org/thoughts/13th-age-rituals/" rel="nofollow">Adam Dray's amazing system of ritual magic for 13th Age</a>. Finally, I was wondering if I could build some sort of deck for social encounters, based on the emotional matrix from Tenra Bansho.<br/><br/>So here I am, designing 4 or 5 new decks and trying to improve my previous design. Things are getting interesting, I'll let you know how crazy it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429615/#Comment_429615" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T21:53:29+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  9:53PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, keep us posted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450307/#Comment_450307" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-04T15:13:42+00:00" title="January  4, 2016  3:13PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rise!<br/><br/>I did made a temporal deck for dungeon generation last year that I fell in love with, and I've been looking foward to include it in the Resourcefull deck as a single tool. For this I had to eliminate some of the lists that were seeing less use. On top of that, it's been so long since I used it continuously that I forgot what were some lists supposed to do. <br/><br/>So instead of going back to a "user manual" everytime I have to remember what's everything for, why not include what's each thing for in every card? I hope it doesn't get too cluttered but making that text grey and small should do the trick. <br/><br/>Numbers and "yes/no/yes but.." results will go, since they haven't seen any use at all. I always have dice at hand anyway, so no need for those. Emotions got turned into small round emoticons with words on one corner, I'm adding a list for classic D&amp;D classes using the icons they gave for free use on websites (though I'll probably end up making my own later) and I'll also list alignments at another corner of the cards.<br/><br/>Now, if things fit nicely, one side should be able to handle complete NPC creation and scene generation. The other should be able to handle Dungeon generation and Monster generation, though I'm still struggling to make proper lists for this last one, ones that could fit the card at last.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450928/#Comment_450928" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-27T16:33:58+00:00" title="January 27, 2016  4:33PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are the list of triggers and traps I ended making up after taking notes from <i>Orcs must die</i> and <i>Epic Quest for the Mighty Loot</i>:<br/><br/><b>Triggers</b>: motion, pressing a slab, block light over some spot, illuminating a place, open something, close something, move something, automatic (cyclical trap) proximity of living creatures, only sudden movement, crossing an area, read a rune, removing an object, 1d6 hidden magnets (activates with metal objects), orb that vibrates with sound, Throne or seat (sitting on it activates the trap), lever, button or rope (on an obvious place), overweight (weight above X lbs. will activate the trap), underweight (reverse the previous one), death of a creature, open a door, activated by someone nearby, take something from a statue, removing a book from a shelf, open a chest.<br/><br/><b>Trap type:</b> 1d6 Blades, 1d6 circular saws, 1d6 guillotines, 1d6 retractable harpoons, difficult terrain, tar, well with (event), well with (Concept), 1d6 explosive barrels, walls closing, darts, cannon, spring / piston crushes victim to the ground, spring / piston pushes victim against roof, spring / piston pushes victim against (draw another trap), treadmill sends victims back to the entrance, treadmill sends victims to (draw another trap), gate (separates party), gate (exits close temporarily, you may draw another trap) jet of (concept), gelatinous cube, loose slabs, loose floor, Huge rolling boulder, mobile trap (runs through the entire room in a rail, pendulum, etc), Double trap (draw 2 cards), Triple trap (draw 3 cards ), shredding machine, blades fall from the ceiling, blade or iron ball atached to a pendulum, sleeping gas, nerve gas, poison gas, corrosive gas, drill(s), landslide, catapult, bear trap, deactivated/broken trap  (draw another trap), non-lethal/joke trap (draw another trap), immobilizes only the one who activates it (draw another trap)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450933/#Comment_450933" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-27T20:13:12+00:00" title="January 27, 2016  8:13PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great list!<br/><br/>I'm also really glad to see you removing things from the cards with testing.

I tried to recycle the concepts (the drawings representing elements and themes on one corner) for this use, but it wasn't fast enough. I'd probably need to remake the drawings to attain this purpose, but by the moment adding class icons is faster. It's still an untried feature though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan" title="SeleneTan"><img alt="SeleneTan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/264/nRW74G3J2K4XC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan">SeleneTan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450952/#Comment_450952" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-28T21:31:19+00:00" title="January 28, 2016  9:31PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <a href="http://game-icons.net/" rel="nofollow">Game Icons</a> project has a lot of useful icons, great for prototyping.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450953/#Comment_450953" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-28T22:14:58+00:00" title="January 28, 2016 10:14PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooooh, tons of great stuff there, many thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463299/#Comment_463299" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-12T22:49:20+00:00" title="May 12, 2017 10:49PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Still struggling with this. There are a few advances though:<br/><br/>-Elements worked quite well, but it took too much space on the card, I'm reducing them to small icons in one corner<br/>-I want to introduce Themes as the main image of one side of the card, replacing elements. Mix anything with a theme and perhaps an emotion and you have a powerful clear story element. Previously things like adjectives, elements and events had suggested these, and many themes were left out of the deck. So why use three lists when themes could be all put in one, using images to give them a wider range of interpretations? After all, this is a lot of what makes Tarot cards so attractive.<br/>-After printing and using a bit the <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/tarokka-deck" rel="nofollow">Tarokka Deck</a> and seeing images from the <a href="http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/dragon-age-inquisition-tarot/" rel="nofollow">Dragon Age Inquisition Tarot</a> I'd also like to add Archetypes. That is, images of characters that suggest NPC ideas by themselves. At least archetypes allows me to drop the Class icons I was thinking of.<br/>-Using Items instead of Weapons, and making these into icons too. You can then roll a die to determine quality, ranging from <i>cursed</i> to <i>magical</i> This reduces two lists to a single one.<br/>- I've got a list of magic rules for freeform rituals that have made wonders for my campaign, I think I can cram it at the bottom of the card.<br/>-Will ditch random list of encounter types, hasn't been too useful.<br/>-Decided to add a proper "monster tactics" random table. Well, perhaps it can be used by NPCs or even PCs. I'm organizing it by strongest stat and even by weakest stat, though there are things that probably any type of monster can use. What I've got so far is this:<br/><br/>STRENGTH<br/>- charges / runs over / tackles<br/>- throws opponents, obstacles, heavy objects, wrecks location<br/>- uses a heavy shield and/or armor. Shield bash.<br/>- grapples / chokes<br/>- big size, slam attack<br/>- uses heavy weapon, greater damage and/or armor damage<br/>- uses oversized weapon for greater reach and area attacks<br/>- can carry more equipment or another creature<br/><br/>DEXTEROUS<br/>- precise attacks<br/>- ranged attacks<br/>- stealthy<br/>- can deflect/catch projectiles<br/>- flexible, can pass trough narrow spaces<br/>- acrobatic<br/>- boomerang attack<br/>- ricochet projectiles<br/>- spinning attack<br/><br/>FAST<br/>- dash<br/>- multiple attacks or actions<br/>- great mobility<br/>- can dodge almost anything<br/>- can swim or fly<br/>- hit &amp; run tactics<br/>- can appear anywhere<br/>- jumps through shadows, plants, etc.<br/><br/>RESISTANT<br/>- big size, can soak tons of damage<br/>- immune to certain types of damage<br/>- resistance to certain type of damage<br/>- can regenerate / heal itself a limited amount of times<br/>- vampiric<br/>- natural armour<br/>- can ignore a certain amount of damage a limited amount of times<br/><br/>INTELLIGENT<br/>- uses complex items or spells<br/>- uses illusions<br/>- uses the terrain or changes it to get advantage<br/>- may see through opponent's tactics<br/>- sends others to do the dirty work<br/>- won't show up until he feels safe/victorious<br/>- sets ambushes, traps and decoys<br/>- attacks when opponents are most vulnerable<br/>- separates their enemies, targets their resources<br/>- is prepared for its opponents<br/>- persistent and patient<br/>- cautious<br/><br/>PERCEPTIVE<br/>- heightened sense(s)<br/>- darkvision, blindsense, tremorsense, echolocalization<br/>- true vision<br/>- telepath, sixth sense, can sense fear or anger<br/>- detects life, magic, traps, lies or an specific materal<br/>- can see/sense through obstacles or great distance, tracker<br/><br/>CHARISMATIC<br/>- fast talker, confuses opponents<br/>- deceives, seduces, persuades or manipulates allies and foes against each other<br/>- manipulates masses of people<br/>- Hypnotic eyes, voice or pattern<br/>- earns their opponent's trust before backstabbing them<br/>- shapeshifts or disguises<br/>- deceives victims into thinking it's harmless<br/><br/>WEAK<br/>- incorporeal<br/>- turns into smoke or liquid<br/>- pack tactics<br/>- uses cover / hides<br/>- is guarded by another creature(s)<br/>- buffs up itself for combat<br/>- relies on speed or brains instead<br/>- blinks or teleports away<br/>- supports other attackers<br/>- uses a single spell-like ability<br/><br/>SLOW<br/>- remains static, uses camouflage<br/>- uses area and/or range attacks<br/>- lives in groups of several individuals<br/>- it's dangerous to stay in their territory<br/>- moves through / attacks from unsuspected places<br/>- paralyzes / attaches itself to victims<br/>- entangles victims<br/>- affects enviroment or uses attack to pull victims to itself<br/>- hard shell or carapace<br/>- telekinetic<br/>- multiplies itself if cut<br/><br/>ANY<br/>- explodes when it dies<br/>- inflicts conditions<br/>- elemental damage with aura, area, breath, ray, touch, etc.<br/>- corrodes / destroys equipment<br/>- intimidating<br/>- aura of terror or insanity<br/>- natural weapons like fangs, claws, tail, horns, spikes, etc<br/>- projects some form of barrier<br/>- affects weather / visibility<br/>- suicidal<br/>- once opponent is weak enough it can steal their soul<br/>- turns victims into monsters<br/>- corrupts their surroundings<br/>- can call allies<br/>- never forgets, learns.<br/>- no door or wall can stop it<br/>- harmful contact<br/>- parasitic<br/>- feeds with blood, emotions, memories, lifeforce or other unusual harmful sources<br/>- uses innocents as shield<br/>- keeps victims alive for a while<br/>- invisible or inaudible<br/>- it's disgusting/revolting to fight against<br/>- resists or its invulnerable to conditions that make sense for it's type or shape<br/>- attacks the weakest first<br/><br/>Did I miss anything important?

I could also imagine having two dimensions to this: i.e. one for <i>what</i> it does (leash out, capture, control, ambush, deceive, threaten...) and <i>how</i> it does it (mental attack, force, acrobatics, illusion, social attack, precision...).<br/>The combination could give you interesting results.<br/><br/>When designing randomizers for a game, a design decision I find important is <i>balancing setting-specific vs generic random parameters</i>. Generally, in my experience, things/chars/monsters can be very specific while events/situations benefit from being more open to interpretation.<br/><br/>I like the way how these games handle random (tables):<br/>- Blades in the Dark<br/>- Mythic GM Emulator<br/>- Maid RPG<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463446/#Comment_463446" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-18T21:55:25+00:00" title="May 18, 2017  9:55PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting! The combination you suggest is somewhat already happening, though in a bit more organic way: a monster can have a theme and a type besides of a tactic. Themes are represented through evocative tarot-like images. Types here are like D&amp;D monster types (undead, aberration, etc) but it's way more extensive and fortunately, they could be turned into icons, saving more space. Its this combination that produces the desired effect a bit more organically, as theme and type would give the user a more proper idea of how the creature would accomplish things, and then the tactics just dictate what will it do.<br/><br/>Well, I'm still pondering how to make it work in the reduced space I have right now. I'm about to finish another prototype, hoping to put it to test this weekend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463684/#Comment_463684" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-03T23:40:42+00:00" title="June  3, 2017 11:40PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2017 12:32AM by Kenny_J.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Rise!<br/><br/>Ok, I've been testing the deck on several other games and while it worked wonders, I admit is still hard to handle the total randomness of the outcomes.

I don't know if this would require a complete redesign or something you could just add. Also tarot suits and numbers combine in interesting ways that make it easier to tell stories that could be an inspiration. <br/><br/>Anyway just my thoughts after skimming this thread, these look cool good luck!<br/><br/>***found it, it's called Russian gypsy fortune telling cards <br/><img alt="image" src="https://fthmb.tqn.com/1hy_0jQVVZ6KjxmxL3WVR2-gzCo=/768x0/filters:no_upscale()/about/gypsy-layout-58b9771c5f9b58af5c493ffa.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463692/#Comment_463692" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-04T16:15:12+00:00" title="June  4, 2017  4:15PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Genius! I think I may have an idea on how to use this with the actual design. Perhaps not with the images but with a couple of things that could use better readability. It's worth a shot. I've been testing the current version so far and while it has certainly reduced the amount of decks and random tables I often use for inspiration, the information still feels somewhat cluttered. See for yourselves:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/DSCN0003_zpshldpbxbg.jpg"/><br/><br/>The cards above show the front side, the cards below show the back. I though they had enough small features to look different but they still need more features to differentiate them quickly. I'll go back to making one side have a dark background and clear on the other. Font size definitely need to be increased again. I was afraid of putting stuff to close to the borders, but now I think I can push that a little to gain more space. <br/><br/>Having two sides make a complete image like in the Russian gypsy fortune cards could help a lot into helping users relate two or more random tables easily, like the set related to dungeon building, even if it's just the words and color alone to relate them it could do wonders. Many thanks for the idea!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463695/#Comment_463695" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-04T19:18:42+00:00" title="June  4, 2017  7:18PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Many thanks for the idea!</p></div></blockquote>\nI'm glad I could help!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464255/#Comment_464255" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-23T16:09:07+00:00" title="June 23, 2017  4:09PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok Kenny, this is how it looks now thanks to you and to my boss at work, who caught me making these and decided to meddle suggesting a different color palette, instead of well firing me. It's not like there was anything else to do so it was better that I was practicing my design skills instead of doing nothing. Also, thanks a lot to Selene for suggesting the icons, it saved me many months of work and a good amount of space on each card.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/IMG_20170623_094506_zpsfmfn2dn5.jpg"/><br/><br/>As usual, the cards above show the front, the cards below show the back. All images in the cards were picked from somewhere on the web, so obviously this version is just for personal use. After testing I'll see if I have enough time to make original pieces for all the cards (maaan that's gonna be an awful lot of work...) and translate it to english. <br/><br/>So how the thing works now? color codes and arrows help a bit now to pair things up, like in this pic (sorry for the crappy quality of my cam) <br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/IMG_20170623_094754_zps43u1uh4m.jpg"/><br/>see where the corners of the cards touch at the center of the pic? Those are supposed to be the icons for fire on the top, a corridor turn to the left and an stairway up on the right, which make a great idea for a dungeon scene: the next room in the dungeon is a lit up corridor that turns to the left (or the right if that doesn't make sense on your map) and ends on a stairway up. You can read these things on a different way of course, after all this deck is just about suggesting ideas to the user.<br/><br/>This next pic is also about places, though more of an outdoor thing:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/IMG_20170623_094959_zpsfrvb3tfk.jpg"/><br/>Here the corners can be easily connected by color to suggest at night, a place with fire as a predominant element and a thunderstorm for weather effect. My first idea was a volcano at night, under a thunderstorm. Dunno why didn't thought of this scenery before!<br/><br/>Red sides are meant to be connected to create traps by suggesting a trap effect and a trigger, which makes up for something quite interesting to roleplay through instead of rolling dice to spot and another to deactivate. If you can deduct the nature of the trigger or the trap there are things you can do to avoid the trap without rolling the dice, or perhaps the players may never know about it nor activate it, since it's meant to activate whenever someone carrying metal objects cross this place and they are all druids.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/IMG_20170623_094714_zpsaj1r1kb2.jpg"/><br/>Here the trap is a rock cube powered by a piston that comes from the ceiling, crushing whoever dared to step into the area carrying a magnetic metal object. I'd say there would be giveaway signs like the metal pulling to the ground a bit or and hydraulic like sound right before it moves, to give the players a chance to roleplay through it.<br/><br/>Also, there are items now! Draw one and roll a d6 to find out if the item is either cursed, barely usable, masterwork, or anything between +1 and +3<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/IMG_20170623_095208_zpselol8gyn.jpg"/><br/><br/>It makes monsters too. The icon over the blue background says what type or shape has the creature (an extraplanar in this case) the text in the blue bubble describes the deal with this creature (this one is both perceptive -probably using echolocalization- and inmune to one type of damage.) You can pile up as many tricks as you like of course. The bigger ones on the bottom are adjectives which state that it looks colorful and reinforced, which probably makes it an extraplanar blind. Throw an element or a pic for theme in the mix to get an idea of which other abilities the creature could have, and random items for loot or equipment <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/mantis_shrimp" rel="nofollow">mantis shrimp</a> from another dimension. <br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/IMG_20170623_094629_zpscrunxfrx.jpg"/><br/><br/>Want NPCs? you've got them! Full with motivations, things they could be doing, an image for an archetype which you can mix with others, an emotion which can be used as a reaction to something the PCs say or do, and adjectives to add further characterization.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/IMG_20170623_095102_zpsyk85zvfq.jpg"/><br/><br/>And there's a list of conditions for high magic that make for great insta-quests whenever the players want to try dealing with unstable wish-like magical rituals and effects.
