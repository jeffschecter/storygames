I invited a friend to participate, but asked him to keep it under his hat.<br/><br/>He didn't stay quiet.  But, the people he leaked it to are impressive &amp; could easily make the endeavor a bigger success.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I feel at risk of being marginalized in my own project... becoming the Winklevoss twins (or the Eduardo) to his Zuckerberg.<br/><br/>One solution would be for me to assert myself as =the= boss &amp; assert a "GM-fiat" type of control over the project.<br/>But, I'd rather devise a way to give him freer reign, with a<b> resolution system</b> to settle our creative &amp; business differences.<br/>I've always wondered if there's a way to attain that old DIY/Dischord Records/egalitarian punk ideal of collaboration, with a random roll<br/>giving the minority stakeholder a fighting chance to get his way.<br/><br/>Maybe something as simple as flipping a coin to settle disputes.  Or maybe more-compex functionality, such as opposed die-pool rolls-- where each party has the option of signing-away 1% of his profitshare of the project, for each extra die-pip of roll-for-creative-control he purchases. <br/> <br/>I could say more, but I think I should wait...  this is enough to explain what I'm looking for, right?<br/><br/>Any suggestions?<br/><br/>I'm going to go read about Pirate ship 'Articles' now, to see how they did it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351064/#Comment_351064" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T20:08:52+00:00" title="December  9, 2011  8:08PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you friends feel about buggery?

I'm at a wedding, typing on my phone.\xa0<br/><br/>When there is a dispute, act as follows:<br/><br/>- Captain states project goals.\xa0<br/><br/>- Pirate confirms they understand project goals or asks questions till they do. If they ask more than 3, they walk the plank.\xa0<br/><br/>- Pirate states what coarse of action they want the pirates to take that the captain disagrees with.\xa0<br/><br/>- Pirate rolls 2d6, and adds them together minus any modifiers the captain chooses (see below). On a 10+, the pirate gets what they want. On 7-9, the pirate gets what they want but only if the pirate first completes a relevant and reasonable stipulation specified by the captain. On a 6 or less, the pirate doesn't get what they want but they earn a cumulative +1 to their next attempt to convince the captain. If the pirate fails to get what they want 3 times in a row, they walk the plank. If they haven't walked the plank and later it is discovered that the captain should have done what the pirate wanted, the pirate can say, "I told you so", and gain +2 to their next roll to convince the captain.\xa0<br/><br/>- Captain may apply any number of the following modifiers to the pirates roll before the roll is made. -6 if what the pirate wants isn't relevant to the project goals, -2 if it requires anyone other than the pirate to exert effort, -2 if it requires more than 1 day of work, -2 if it costs money not accounted for in the budget, -6 if it would kill the captains enthusiasm for the project.\xa0                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351161/#Comment_351161" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-11T07:57:48+00:00" title="December 11, 2011  7:57AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2011 4:15PM by Todd_L.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks John!

But a lot of people haven't played Craps or Settlers! <br/><br/>A budget system could work. Every day you complete work, you get a chip. When you have a conflict, it costs chips to get what you want. You can then use the modifiers to adjust the amount of chips required. This way the more work you put in, the more say you have in the future. Less about chance, and more about spending a money like resource.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
