                    So board games have the same problem, when I say that I am going to my board games Meetup people often ask me, "what sort of board games do you play?"<br/><br/>I honestly don't know how to answer, because describing the games I play requires being familiar with a terminology that means nothing to someone uninitiated.<br/><br/>RPG's have a similar if not worse problem. If you want to tell someone you're playing something other than dungeons &amp; dragons (not that there's anything wrong with that game) people look at you surprised not having known there <i>are</i> other RPGs.<br/><br/>How do you deal with this issue? What do you say to get people interested? (Or simply explain the experience in some way)                </div>

                            Who are you trying to explain this to? Total strangers? Gamers? Trad gamers? Board gamers?<br/><br/>I’d treat each of these quite differently.                        </div>

                            Fair question, it's funny I think I find it easiest to explain it to folks who have never played any tabletop story game/Role playing game. For them I just go conceptual. Hey it's like organized make believe but we all agree on some rules to guide the story. <br/><br/>But usually it's Trad gamers and boardgames. <br/><br/>I personally usually just say "yeah there are other RPG's cool stuff on a spectrum of kind of like D&amp;D games on one end and some very very different sorts of games on the other"<br/><br/>That part is not so difficult, but I'm not sure where to send them to find out more info. Even the somewhat limited knowledge of the games I know it took quite a while to acquire.  <br/> </div>

                            There isn’t necessarily a good “jumping off point” for story games or indie RPGs.<br/><br/>Your best bet might be Tabletop (there are good sessions of both Fiasco and Misspent Youth) and/or all the podcasts out there that do story game playthroughs.<br/><br/>Some Kickstarter intro videos could be helpful, too! They tend to be brief and to the point.<br/><br/>In the other hand, if you ARE asking about introducing and explaining:<br/><br/>For trad gamers:<br/><br/>“I’m interested in role playing games that have a more dynamic narrative; they are designed to worry less about winning fights and more about characters, their stories, and difficult personal decisions. Some of these games don’t even have a GM, so everyone gets to contribute creatively to what’s happening.”<br/><br/>For board gamers:<br/><br/>“The games I enjoy are tabletop games, like board games, but instead of manipulating figures on a board, there’s a strong component of imagined or fictional material. As a player, you’re not limited to the actions the game has specified for you, but can try a nearly infinite number of options to solve problems or get ahead. It’s like participating in making a tv show, movie, or novel, while also being a character within it.”                        </div>

                            I've always found that storygames are much easier to sell non-gamers on (in big part because they're very much designed to be parseable by non-gamers, whereas trad presumes gaming experience, and because storygames use skills more commonly held by non-gamers than tactics and strategy) as long as the DnD comparison isn't made, or as long as it's immediately shut down if it's made.<br/>"Is this like DnD?"<br/>"No, not at all."<br/>I can imagine it would be harder with neo-trad stuff and other more orthodox indie stuff though, since the answer with some of those games to "Is this like DnD?" is "ehh, sort of". whereas the stuff I play is entirely unlike DnD.                         </div>

                            Yeah, that's been my experience, too. I tend to use a GMless storytelling game when "introducing" non-gamers to the idea, and then graduate to other things later, if they're interested in branching out.                        </div>
