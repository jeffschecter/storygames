As I mentioned before, the thing I like best about it is that it's got a very focused skill list. As GURPS has known for years, the choice of a "what you can do" list really focuses a game, which is the main struggle of Vampire for anyone, regardless of experience level. Actually, the system used in the computer RPG Vampire: Bloodlines is quite similar.  (Bloodlines is available on Steam, if you can get it running, I highly recommend it.) The focus of the quickstart is what makes it good for both Vampire player noobs and GM noobs. It basically says "okay, so you want to learn this crazy Vampire game. Here's an example of a Vampire game about these things. Try it out, see what you think. Do you like it, do you want to change it? Cool, you're ready for the big toybox." <br/><br/>Any specific questions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Imperator" title="Imperator"><img alt="Imperator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/569/nUS8BD26ISIQN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Imperator">Imperator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296383/#Comment_296383" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-09T18:42:33+00:00" title="October  9, 2010  6:42PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finished my first quickstart game a few minutes ago. A short mission-based game set in Victorian England. I have some questions about Humanity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quickstart lacks Humanity rules. Humanity is a very important part of Vampire. Any ideas on how implementing it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, how could we create some character skills development given that the game doesn't havvev any XP rules? Which is understandable, given that is meant for a demo, after which you will buy the full game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose two are my most pressing questions. More to come as I get some sleep and think about the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
