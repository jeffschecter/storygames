You mean the aliens! <br/>Lloyd: Yes. You know, the reason we came down here in the first place! <br/><br/>"Alice (Driven Anchor) looks at the console, regarding it like a personal enemy." <br/><br/>"Jessica (Innocent Sweetheart) is kind of defusing and calming down gradually."<br/>"Good, then it's just point 2. Have you ever kissed a guy?"  (I'm sorry, you were saying something about 'calming down'?) <br/><br/><i>Dear Jason, <br/>You should have just been asked to tutor Jessica. Given that the only real alternative is Julian (ex-anchor and Lothario), I appeal to your sense to accept the task. If that fails, consider that I will bash your head in if you don't accept, and I'm sure the right choice will become clear. Abuse the trust I have given you, and I'll rip your balls off, so be polite and gentle, and make sure she *likes* it. <br/>Regards, <br/>Lloyd. <br/>P.S. Not kidding about the 'balls' part. Seriously. </i><br/><br/>Jessica: "Oh, and when he says tutor," she says, in a kind of forced casual voice that she doesn't feel, "he means kiss." <br/><br/>SoylentWhite: I'm trying to get into the mind of a cynical, traumatised, manipulative, near-death 17 year old. Forgive me if sleeping with more than 1 woman doesn't seem that big a deal. <br/>ElliottBelser: Ahem.  We were just discussing the ethics of being a slut for the purposes of this game. <br/>SoylentWhite: To which I was saying Lloyd's general reaction was: 'Ethics? *pfhhht*' <br/><br/>"Albtraumhafter ausl\xe4ndischer Abschaum! Essen Sie Schei\xdfer!" - Dr. Schwartzchild describes the invaders, and offers them some advice.<br/><br/>Regarding a terrible Pilot's Nightmare check involving a sensor buoy: <br/>SoylentWhite: It's a <i>very</i> scary sensor buoy. <br/><br/>On the surprising discovery that they have flightsuits:<br/>SoylentWhite: Uniform? How on earth did we scavenge one of those? Army surplus shop? (or worse. must . . . clean . . . brain) <br/>ChessyPig: No, it's part of the ANIMa design, so it's lame and probably made out of the remains of someone's fetish gear after Eloise absent-mindedly said she needed some latex clothing. (having looked up 'plugsuit' on Google) <br/>SoylentWhite: That's what I was thinking when I said 'worse'. <br/><br/>Dr. Schwartzchild: "...do not misunderstand. Ah... Sex education... let's put it that way, yes... especially regarding the emotions involved, is vital. I just rather disapprove of your requiring PRACTICALS WITH UNWILLING TUTORS." <br/><br/>Tarragon (minor chara) on pacifism: "There are times... times, mind... when I almost make an exception for the Nightmares."<br/><br/>"As I understand it, which I don't..." Tarragon tries to describe the ANIMa.<br/><br/>Tarragon: "A... kiss... wouldn't matter so much as the intent behind it, which is why I don't understand Lloyd's ...request. "<br/>SoylentWhite: (And this is the part Lloyd will <b>never </b>understand.) <br/><br/>----<br/><br/>We also have actual play reports up the wazoo there: check it out.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162880/#Comment_162880" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-16T19:05:01+00:00" title="August 16, 2008  7:05PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            New from  today's excellent RP: I'm going to post an Actual Play analysis.<br/><br/><b>Innocent Sweetheart Jessica by her Anchor, Thomas:</b><br/>Jessica: "Alice wouldn't suggest *tennis*. Or a *walk*." She sounds contemptuous of the activities, as if they are below her status as a pilot. <br/>Thomas sighs. "No, but I wouldn't suggest to you what Alice would suggest to Lloyd." <i>(Alice/Lloyd: Int 5)</i><br/><br/>Thomas starts. "I don't know what to do, Jess. Every time I let you get in that pod, and every time you come out more distant than before. And I don't know what to do!" <br/>Jessica's face twists in an agony of not knowing what to say. "I don't want to be angry because then you'll run away," she manages, choked, her eyes fierce. <br/><br/>Thomas nods. "Yes. I'm weak. I know that now. But I don't want to lose you, Jess." <br/><br/>"What *do* you want to do tomorrow?" <br/>"Maybe we *could* go for a walk," she conceded. "After all, it's a lot like the real world in the dream, it's good to keep track of landmarks," she added, spoiling it rather. <br/>Thomas smiles, slightly. "A walk it is, then." <br/><br/><br/><b>Seasoned Veteran Lloyd with cook Amanda:</b><br/>SoylentWhite: Does being disembowelled count as a negative to a seduction check? <br/><br/>Amanda grins. "Tommy and Wonder Girl are kissing and making up. You know, I really don't talk to anyone much but Dr. S, and that's because she's looking for a sign to put me on crazy pills." <br/><br/>Lloyd: "You scare people off, and most people won't care enough to look below the surface." <br/>Amanda: "You seperate the wheat from the chaff by beating it senseless, right?" She shakes her head slightly. <br/>Lloyd: "Awful lot of chaff around, and not much wheat." <br/>Amanda: "So would you slap me for saying you go against the grain?" She sips her water. <br/>Lloyd: "I certainly seem to rub some people up the wrong way, I'll give you that." he says half-smiling. <br/>Amanda: "And Alice the RIGHT way, apparently," she says with a rather vicious smile. <br/>Lloyd: "It's a talent. Want me to show you?" A smile shows he's half-joking. <br/>Amanda: "Dear me, does Alice know?" Half joking herself. <br/>Lloyd: "Oh, she knows how I rub her, alright." (deliberately misunderstanding) <br/>Amanda: Amanda shrugs. "I could stand some lessons, assuming that this won't result in our murder." <br/>Lloyd: "Understand, my lessons are heavily subscribed, but for a favoured customer, I could fit you in a few days after you stop hearing Alice scream at me." <br/><br/>Amanda suddenly sobers up a bit. "...I wonder what would happen if we outright asked?" <br/>Lloyd finally looks serious. "I was intending to, but there's no 'we'. This is my burden." <br/><br/>Amanda: She slumps back in her chair. "Mental note: get Julian to raid the market for more gin." <br/>Lloyd nods. "Yeah. I have a stash already - want some?" <br/><br/>Lloyd: "I don't want to hurt anyone. Not you, not Alice. But I *need* both of you." <br/>Amanda: "<i>Presumably</i> for reasons other than an arms race," she mutters. <br/>Lloyd: "It doesn't work like that. False emotions are useless. Your manifestation is so powerful *because* my feelings for you are so strong." <br/>Amanda is silent for a long second, before she sighs: "...I know, Lloyd." She puts her hand on the table. <br/><br/>Lloyd looks down. "Look, I don't just want your body, I want *you*. Do I love Alice? Yes. Do I believe I also love you? Yes. I know what kind of a man that makes me, but I can't change my feelings." <br/>"I'm guessing it makes you normal..." Amanda seems to be thinking of something to add. <br/>Lloyd laughs. "Yeah, probably. But what about you?" <br/>Amanda blinks. "That's odd. I honestly don't feel jealous." <br/>Lloyd: "You don't? I'm honestly surprised. Far be it from me to look a gift horse in the mouth, but would you mind telling me why?" <br/>Amanda has to think about it. "As soon as I find out, I'll let you know. Promise." <br/><br/><b>Lloyd by his Anchor, Alice:</b><br/>Alice: "Then what am I meant to do about your robot gun size problems?" <br/>Lloyd: "Because I can only come up with one solution." <br/>Alice: "....you really are going to kiss Julian?" <br/><br/>Lloyd smiles. "Get your mind out of the gutter." <br/>"Oh, I'm sorry," Alice purrs, "where would you rather my mind was?" She breathes over her fingernails again, trying to work out if they're dry enough to use yet. <br/>Lloyd smile changes. "good point. Stay in the gutter, we'll need it there soon enough." <br/><br/>"You wanted to fuck other girls behind my back?" Alice appears to be shocked and outraged that you'd think of doing it any other way (than all at once). <br/>Lloyd: "It's hardly behind your back if I get permission from you first, is it?" <br/>Alice: "It totally is. Even if I didn't mind, I'd want to keep an eye on you." (It's obvious that's not quite the real reason, but she doesn't want to share the real reason now you've reacted like that) <br/>Lloyd: "In case I do what? You *know* I'd be f**king them, what could I do that's *worse* than that... And can I do it to you?" <br/>"In case you get... attached!" Alice waves her arms around. "And..." she looks kind of upset, "and I don't want to lose you, Lloyd." <br/><br/>Lloyd: "I understand you don't like her, and I'm sorry about that." <br/>"You sure I can't tempt you into kissing Julian?" teases Alice, mostly not serious. "I mean, Jason would be my first choice, but it sounds like he's out of the running already." <br/>Lloyd looks slightly unhappy, though trying to hide it. "If the war gets bad enough, I may have to."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Metal%20Fatigue" title="Metal Fatigue"><img alt="Metal Fatigue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://msen.com/~sethb/xkcd-sqrt-love.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Metal%20Fatigue">Metal Fatigue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164254/#Comment_164254" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T16:36:20+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  4:36PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elliott's game logs at the CURS wiki convinced me to buy the PDF rules, and I wound up joining the game (playing a couple of minor characters, one of whom may well undergo pilot training). I had this to say over there:\n<blockquote><i>I have </i>never<i> had a game get this far into my head this quickly before. I woke up in the middle of last night worrying about what would happen to poor Tarragon and Jessica because they can't figure out how to talk about their relationship.
