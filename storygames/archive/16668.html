I have an opening for a player to take on a role in the game of play-by-post Primetime Adventures I am running on RPoL.net, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://rpol.net/gameinfo.php?gi=48448&amp;date=1339083015" rel="nofollow">'Paradise, Alaska'</a>. The show is dark, with a 'Twin Peaks' type of feel, including some hints of weird, possibly supernatural goings-on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had a highly successful Pitch session and now the game is in its pilot episode, and a player has had to drop out. The character you will be playing is Trooper Hudson, a small town cop in Paradise who struggles to command respect in the community due to an error they made early in their law enforcement career that left a local man crippled. Trooper Hudson's Issue in this season is 'Atonement &amp; Respect'.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe character has only made a tiny onscreen appearance so far, so they are still open to be played how you wish. There is no pre-existing character development. Even the details of the character such as name, gender, appearance, and personality are still open to change if you wish.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe character will be an integral part of the storyline, with an instant hook of investigating a murder to get you into the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, if you want to create a brand new character that would be fine too, as we are only 6 scenes into the Pilot Episode.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a cast of creative, mature players, and I hope that you would be able to complement this group. The posting rate is pretty casual, once a day when your character is involved in a scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested and want to play, please get in touch, either here, through RPoL.net, or at paulspraget@gmail.com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DrTachyon" title="DrTachyon"><img alt="DrTachyon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DrTachyon">DrTachyon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381229/#Comment_381229" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T11:59:29+00:00" title="June  7, 2012 11:59AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently playing in the game, and I'll add my 2 cents. So far, the player base has been fantastic (as has the Producer) and we could really use a replacement for Trooper Hudson.  My character (the town doctor) was called by the police to help investigate a murder scene, as the medical examiner would take a while to fly into town. I'm sure that my character will be having future scenes with the Trooper so I'm hoping we can get someone to step in and make the character their own. I can only say great things about the game so far and as Staxx said, come take a look on RPOL to see if the game looks like the kind of thing you may be interested in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mulrah" title="mulrah"><img alt="mulrah" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mulrah">mulrah</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382245/#Comment_382245" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-13T20:57:18+00:00" title="June 13, 2012  8:57PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't quite tell from RPOL.net; have you found someone for this yet?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
