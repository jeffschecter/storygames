Is Vincent talking about random tables when he instructs the way to use dice in DiV? Or is he talking about a game that only uses dice for conflict resolution between dramatic actors?<br/><br/>I always thought that he was just using a metonymic figure of speech there, where the "dice" stand for "conflict resolution". He's not saying "never in any game use dice for anything except avoiding saying yes" - his message is much simpler: in DiV (and, charitably, certain similar games), the GM is disallowed from refusing anything to the PCs unless they lose a conflict resolution process. Nothing to do with weather tables, everything to do with limiting GM fiat.<br/><br/>Interpreting the pithy catchphrase as some sort of universal rpg wisdom is the same trap of essentialism that roleplaying has struggled with for its entire history. If 21st century rpg theory has actually contributed anything worthwhile to the artform, it is the realization that there is very little essential to it. "Say yes or roll the dice" certainly isn't it, we could spend all day naming games where it's just bad advice - simply because the purpose of play is different, and the dice are used for different purposes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol" title="Jonathan Nicol"><img alt="Jonathan Nicol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol">Jonathan Nicol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473478/#Comment_473478" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T04:18:55+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  4:18AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trying to turn every game into Burning Wheel is just as bad as trying to turn every game into Vampire = The Masquerade in terms of play techniques. <br/><br/><b>Say yes or roll the dice</b> would be horrible for B/X or Apocalypse World or a number of other games.

As has been discussed in other venues, a player wanting something that is totally logically out of bounds does not warrant rolling the dice or giving in to the player. Reading Burning Wheel's text on the subject, it says, if there is no conflict say yes. But a player making an out of bounds statement is making an out of bounds statement and you deal with that. Once the statement of intent is in bounds, then you decide if there's an actual conflict or not, and roll dice, or say yes.<br/><br/>I think in fact this was how good GMs always ran games.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473487/#Comment_473487" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T05:50:15+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  5:50AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He even added dice rolls to things in old-school D&amp;D that were already autoyesses at our table (Seclusium p 156).<br/><br/>Vincent is baller\u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473495/#Comment_473495" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T07:42:41+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  7:42AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2018 7:45AM by DeReel.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cease fire.

OTOH I sometimes prep coarsely enough that the prep would just say which <i>room</i> the evidence is in. In which case checking the drawers or the mattress would be fine. But either a dice roll isn't necessary or it isn't enough. It starts <i>and ends</i> with positioning.</p></div></blockquote>\nMainly because I consider this kind of "there is only one, specific, precise solution," to be a common cultural trapping of play with 80's and 90's games.<br/><br/>Your mention of how coarsely you prep demands the question: At what level of granularity do you truly stop? How many drawers, loose baseboards, and books on the shelves are there to search? If there's ever a time when a player achieved their ends only by searching the correct room, that's their expectation. If there's ever a time when a player was thwarted UNTIL they searched the tenth tiny, discrete location, they'll always search at least that much whenever they can. The only way to head that off is to do things like creating tight time restrictions or some kind of backlash for leaving traces of their presence/search that are only triggered by searching some certain (possibly secret, possibly arbitrary) amount.<br/><br/>Of course all of this depends on the system (for example, a game in which stakes are announced up-front is going to work differently from a game in which outcomes are only narrated afterwards), but you can avoid making your own bed of problems with that one by saying that fictional positioning matters in a different way: *how* things are done.<br/>"I look in all of the obvious places - carefully, so I don't leave any sign of my presence. Do I find anything or do any less obvious places catch my eye in the process?"<br/>That's when you offer a tougher choice: "You don't find anything in a cursory search, but there are a lot of places something could be hidden. If you want to get more involved, it's going to eat up your afternoon and you'll definitely leave traces of your presence behind."<br/>Then the player has the chance to commit to that risk or alter the circumstances: "I don't have time for this, I toss the place," or, "I call in a favor to Mrs. X. One of her boys can make this look like a burglary."<br/>And then, the best part is that you can still have different outcomes based on the final act and how it's being carried out. Tossing the place is more thorough than a careful once-over, but is haphazard, so the player found a piece of small evidence. But calling in Mrs. X's boys finds a safe that contains something more serious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/emarsk" title="emarsk"><img alt="emarsk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/831/nTAGTUPOK6CW5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/emarsk">emarsk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473503/#Comment_473503" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T09:44:43+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  9:44AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I see it, "say yes or roll the dice" is not in any way antithetic to "roll the dice".<br/><br/>The meaningful part is "say yes".

Preferably either a picture, or an itemized list of features of interest. Precision in process description is only possible if the fiction is described precisely. And obviously, my answer to "what do you do" is, "I look inside, under and behind every single item you just listed." Plus the walls, floor and ceiling, of course - we're not newbs here.<br/><br/>Alternatively: here, have my pre-written search protocol, it lists and carefully defines what "all of the obvious places" consists of, and in what order I study them. I can read it aloud item by item if that makes it feel more like roleplaying. If you've managed to hide something in a way that defies the protocol, you might as well have it - I'm not gonna think of another possible hiding place on the spot.<br/><br/>(Does anybody know, by the way: is this the way professional conduct home searches? I could see it being protocol-based, simply because I don't really see the advantage in free-styling something like that. It's surely more certain to just start at one side of the room and examine every separate object in the room in order until you find what you're looking for.)<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I think it's pretty obvious why I enable dice-based searching; I don't think that a dialogue-based approach is truly sufficient alone if you desire the process to be quick and have uncertainty. If the players actually take the pixel-bitching seriously, it becomes much less interesting [grin].<br/><br/>Specifically, an observation: dialogue-based searching, as other dialogue-based procedures, has no ready means for establishing imponderables. Somebody at some point has to decide how visible the outline of the secret door in the wood paneling is, precisely, and whether a character with sigh-correcting eye-glasses, going over the wall with an acoustic hammer and a flashlight, keeping their field of view at precisely five inches distance from the wall surface, is going to spot it when they pass over it in their examination. You can either just let them have it, or roll for it, or deny it arbitrarily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473512/#Comment_473512" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T11:59:32+00:00" title="May  8, 2018 11:59AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And obviously, my answer to "what do you do" is, "I look inside, under and behind every single item you just listed."</p></div></blockquote>\nThere's a bookshelf and on the bottom shelf one of the books is third from the left<br/><br/>suddenly the smell of 3d4 snakes fill the air! and they are singing the bitey bitey song!<br/><br/>"bitey bite o bitey bite o bitey bitey bite!" you hear<br/>make 7 defense rolls vs attack value 13<br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>here, have my pre-written search protocol, it lists and carefully defines what "all of the obvious places" consists of, and in what order I study them</p></div></blockquote>\nThat, on the other hand, is awesome<br/><br/>but Eero why the pushback here?

I was just exploring the implications.<br/><br/>I am specifically concerned about the imponderables myself, when it comes to D&amp;D procedure: if you don't roll the dice or engage in tediously simulating the cracks in the ceiling, how do you account for them? Does it not devolve into "say yes or roll the dice" in that sense? How does a GM achieve a moral position where they can actually say no to a player on the basis of imponderable details that nobody has really established?<br/><br/>(What I mean by "imponderables" in the wargame context: those small details of the fictional situation that obviously exist yet are never established in advance because they fall below the threshold of simulation. Wind and sun direction are usually not accounted in D&amp;D missile combat, for instance. The basic wargaming conceit is that the dice roll "covers" these details - or equivalently, that we can establish them after the fact, once we know what the roll was. "You rolled so badly, apparently the wind and the sun were not your friends on this shot.")<br/><br/>I can see a GM avoid rolling the dice to determine the weight of the imponderable factors in challengeful D&amp;D by "saying yes": you just assume that anything that has not been explicitly established poses no problem to the adventurers.<br/><br/>I can also see the GM rolling for the imponderables: now that we've established that something is happening, let's roll to find out if anything goes awry. Sometimes there is no problem, other times the imponderable factors are indeed against the adventurers, and cause an otherwise well-thought-out plan to fail. Sometimes you just miss that secret stash, even if your search procedure covered it; perhaps you got smoke in your eye at the wrong moment, or somebody distracted you.<br/><br/>What I can't see is the GM outright deciding that the imponderable factors cause failure; that would be arbitrary tyranny. I suppose that the D&amp;D GM is, indeed, caught in the "say yes or roll the dice" binary!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473518/#Comment_473518" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T12:46:03+00:00" title="May  8, 2018 12:46PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Verbal Exchange Clue Hunt" is, I suspect, much like "Carefully mapping a dungeon on graph paper and using it for clues", or, well, a few other types of Old-Skool activities, in that it is a fun sub-game...once in a while.<br/><br/>OTOH, it's also an activity that can become annoying when overdone, unless you reduce the overall activity to that one activity being the main part of play, and focusing on it with everyone's buy-in in advance.<br/><br/>( Minis and grid combat probably fits in this category as well.

"How detailed do you want to go?" is always present in this type of game where you want to have real issues while obviously not being a god capable of simply creating a pocket universe to run simulations in. It is an universal fact if you're doing any sort of simulative gaming at all.<br/><br/>I refer to a golden mean because forgoing the simulation entirely (with e.g. mechanical subgame like modern D&amp;D has) side-steps the very thing we're trying to do, while insisting (falsely) that you're running a perfect simulation leaves the imponderable factors up to arbitrary GM tyranny. The best position is, I think, in the middle: strive to simulate your wargaming concerns, yet recognize that the simulation is limited and you are forced to simplify, abstract and randomize on minor and undetermined factors.<br/><br/>Sometimes the simulation threshold is lower and sometimes higher, some people want to simulate some things that others prefer to leave imponderable. It is a category error to perceive this as a binary matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473521/#Comment_473521" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T13:35:56+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  1:35PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            like if this stuff is boring then what isn't boring! boring dragons fly at you and you need to roll boring save against breath!? <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23emo2097&amp;Mode=like">#emo2097</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473522/#Comment_473522" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T13:51:50+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  1:51PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2018 1:52PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>you just assume that anything that has not been explicitly established poses no problem to the adventurers.</p></div></blockquote>I prefer a different approach.<br/><br/>I think if the GM's job in that game is to be an impartial referee of challenges, then that dovetails nicely with the GM also acting as an impartial presenter of the setting.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the GM's <i>intuitive sense of what is correct</i>, if informed by a strong but dispassionate connection to the setting, is a perfectly fine substitute for random rolls, and vastly superior to a logic of "every corner of the setting you haven't previously examined favors the players".<br/><br/>The moral authority to say "no" stems from the social contract which grants the GM that authority in exchange for the GM providing the players with as "real"-feeling a challenge arena (and exploration sandbox) as the GM can.<br/><br/>When I GM, I am careful to make this logic transparent.  It's never, "I don't want there to be cracks in the ceiling," it's always, "This place appears stable and not that old, and this part of the world has never known earthquakes, so no, there are no cracks in the ceiling."<br/><br/>If my intuition and knowledge of the setting are completely <i>mute</i> on a question, though, <i>then</i> I go with "say yes or roll".<br/><br/>(Not that all fiction-focused challenge gaming is the same.

Not so much after the umpteenth room in the dungeon.<br/><br/>Grid-n-minis combat can be fun, but not every session and taking up 90% of the play time every session.<br/><br/>Mapping can be fun, in a dungeon where it really matters and is part of unravelling the mystery of the space involved. It isn't that fun every session with every dungeon.<br/><br/>Logistics of dungeon delving can be fun every now and then. So can bargaining at the souk for great deals.

I would think no matter how much you enjoy detailed hunt-the-verb room search simulation (and I like it plenty well!  bring on the detailed mechanical trap mechanisms!), eventually you would face the point where the players are asking about something you hadn't thought out.<br/><br/>As an extreme example, what if the party walks into Port Nyanzaru and the rogue player starts asking you for extreme details of every house you walk past.  How many doors?  How many windows?  Is the garden well maintained?  Can I see a lock on the door?  Perhaps he's looking for the best one to rob.<br/><br/>So, these aren't boring details, but there is no way you can have them all prepared for every house in the city, can you?  So at that way you need some other way to proceed.  Say yes, say no, roll the dice, go with your intuition, something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473547/#Comment_473547" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T15:42:15+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  3:42PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>-How much session time do you have left?<br/>-Can you make searching/haggling/etc. a fun activity?<br/>-How much tolerance do you have as a group for slowing down the story?<br/>-How good are you dealing with improvised content?</p></div></blockquote>I think this list is perfect.  And the point is important: in most RPGs, there actually <i>isn't</i> one way to do things that's optimal for all situations.  There are reasons why players have been treating RPGs like toys rather than games for decades, and this is one of them.  On Thursday at 8pm, playing out the process of examining every tome on the shelf can be a captivating adventure.  On Tuesday at 10pm, that same examination might bore and frustrate everyone in the room.<br/><br/>For just about every RPG situation, I like to have at least one option to play out the experience in detail, and at least one option to get the necessary info/results super quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473548/#Comment_473548" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T15:55:22+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  3:55PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>For just about every RPG situation, I like to have at least one option to play out the experience in detail, and at least one option to get the necessary info/results super quickly.</p></div></blockquote>\nThis deserves it's own mention in any rulebook.

It's a bummer that you had bad experiences, but I specifically asked WHY you think that rather than expressing disbelief that you DO think it. I'm open to other possibilities, but it sounds like you played with obstructionist jerks who applied their own obstructionist jerk agenda atop the rules.<br/><br/>Now, I'm definitely interested in examining rule sets that somehow attract, allow, or perhaps subtextually enable people to apply their own obstructionist jerk agendas atop the rules; but if all we're talking about is bad GM behavior/culture, let's at least call it that and talk about it in that light.<br/><br/>Also, maybe they weren't jerks and that's all they knew. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473589/#Comment_473589" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-09T00:01:31+00:00" title="May  9, 2018 12:01AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I don't think they were jerks.

I've played with a bunch of people, most of them my friends, and it was just how it was for... I'm assuming us?<br/>Maybe you just were one of the lucky few?  <br/>If your game master has any bones of a plot, and that includes pre-made characters; in order for it to feel genuine, and mechanically solid, that requires preparation. When players would veer off this skeleton, the world get's less solid, or perhaps rigorously so to the point of rigidity.<br/>It wasn't the best idea, but that's the tools we had at the time.  <br/>I think that addressing bad GMs is not the best idea.  I mean, it hints at the holes in the game, or in the explaining of the game, or in the very nature of role-playing games.  What's it do to just label people as "bad people"?<br/><br/>It's just a difficult model: role-playing games. <br/>I'd rather not police what I could view as the bad form of strangers, let alone abstract strangers.

It is about training GMs to not call for a roll for stuff you can just say yes to. The mechanics of DitV (where this comes from) are time consuming. So, if you are not willing to say yes, roll the dice. Otherwise say yes.<br/><br/>It addresses several issues:<br/><br/>1) The "we played all night without rolling the dice" phenomenon. Is that a good thing, did you say yes the whole time?<br/><br/>2) The "do we have to roll the dice"  question? If you as a GM don't want to say, yes, roll it.<br/><br/>3) The "I (the GM) don't like that outcome, so no you can't have it" issue. Too bad, rol the dice and let them decide.<br/><br/>4) The "what do I do when PCs do stuff the game is not designed for" question. Say yes or make a conflict that draws the game into what it is designed for.<br/><br/>5) The "roll for awareness" technique. While this is a good technique, its a bad idea in ditv where rolling takes a long time and test how far your character is willing to go to get what they want. If they PC looks around, just tell them what they see.<br/><br/>I would say, I never treated it as gospel in any other games besides ditv. But the concept did bleed into my other GMing (more saying yes and more use of mechanics and less fiat).<br/><br/>Not sure I have heard other GMs treat this as anything more than interesting advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473748/#Comment_473748" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-10T21:32:58+00:00" title="May 10, 2018  9:32PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It works so well for DitV\u2665<br/>I can imagine it's an OK fit for BW too                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473750/#Comment_473750" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-10T21:35:53+00:00" title="May 10, 2018  9:35PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

If your play is <i>at all</i> parochial, you well could spend decades playing only games for which a given cornerstone maxim holds true; it would be easy to mistake part for the whole and start thinking that it's universally true for all rpgs, simply because you haven't personally witnessed ones where it's the wrong advice.<br/><br/>"Say yes or roll the dice."<br/>"Players play their characters, GM plays the world."<br/>"The GM's word is law."<br/>"Rulings, not rules."<br/>"Never cheat or fudge."<br/>"The GM brings the plot."<br/>"Immerse in your character."<br/>"There is no wrong answer."<br/>"Always go for the throat."<br/>"Avoid cliches."<br/>"Embrace tropes."<br/><br/>Note that roleplaying is much more varied in this regard than many other forms of game. Boardgames, for instance, have many universal maxims where roleplaying games hardly have any.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473772/#Comment_473772" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T05:02:39+00:00" title="May 11, 2018  5:02AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>-How much session time do you have left?</p></div></blockquote>\nSuch an important question!

As a GM, I'm likely to streamline to make sure we get to a good break point or conclusion -- or to try to break a bit early if we're about to get into something that will take a fair amount of time to do right.

Like in NES Metroid where it's not random whether you find a secret door, you find it because you searched there (or accidentally happen to search there).<br/><br/>Why is "you can randomly miss the traps" / "you can randomly miss the treasure" interesting gameplay?

I don't go "OK, you go in the first cell.

And not about the loose brick in cell 2.<br/>If they go in and scrape the mortar from floor to ceiling in each cell, I charge more time and thus more encounter checks.<br/><br/>Search protocols are good!<br/><br/>This also ties in to the "instead of controlling pacing, the game slows down to ask questions in order to get clarity, and speeds up when there is clarity."<br/>Once there is search protocol, I'll go to the gloracle with that and be like hmm ok so as you step into cell 8, snakes fall down" or w/e the gloracle says. Because that's a situation that demands clarity ("how do they deal with the snakes?"), since "how do you search" question was given clarity by the search protocol.<br/><br/>We notice this a lot in the hexcrawl game I'm running now.

Yes, you can just "say yes" on any factors that happen to be elided in search protocols, in which case you don't need to roll - but why then doesn't the same work for random encounter checks? Couldn't you just make camp in such a fashion as to make it impossible for an encounter to occur?<br/><br/>(I'm thinking a cold camp with scent obfuscation and thermal shielding if necessary, positioned in a random place with no signs of frequent travel. Basically, reduce the probability of a monster stumbling on the party to the point where the monster would have to essentially walk over the sleeping adventurers to spot them.)<br/><br/>This comparison might not make any sense to you, in which case please ignore it - it just interests me because to me those seem like the same type of dice roll: a short-cut to establishing an outcome without having to just say yes on the imponderable details we don't feel like going into right now.<br/><br/>One could, of course, ask the same question of combat rolls like attacks and saves and such, but I suppose those are so different emotionally that you couldn't expect them to necessarily work the same as searching and random encounter checks anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474361/#Comment_474361" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-31T19:37:04+00:00" title="May 31, 2018  7:37PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2018 8:05PM by Airk.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Another option would be to charge them time.

Like you don\u2019t want to, as a player, be good at finding, you want a character to have Finding +7 or perhaps Finding -2 if you want to expend resources elsewhere.

If they start turning over every nook and cranny well that\u2019s the gameplay they make. And ofc they \u201cprotocolize\u201d this, as long as there is clarity. \u201cWe are prying loose the floor tiles and moving them out of the dungeon.\u201d \u201cOK, if the floor tiles counts as Small Items, how many can you take at once? Twelve across the party and then you\u2019re encumbered but not heavily? And each trip to the surface takes about 30 minutes, right? So that\u2019ll be four hours for the trips and twelve times 10 minutes between each trip, for prying, 24 hours total. You\u2019re working 8 hour days?\u201d etc etc</p><p>And if they don\u2019t care for the extra easter eggs or w/e then they don\u2019t search so carefully</p><p>I also want to add that search rolls actually <em>have</em> made their way into my game, as of the latest session, earlier this week, it snuck up on me. There is a rule in 5e that you can forage for food with a survival check daily. And I didn\u2019t make the connection that this was similar to search rolls so I kept the rule in there. And then we latched more and more stuff onto that rule. Like right now they are looking for ingredients for bug salve (in quantity, in a big jungle, that\u2019s prepped with 10 mile coarse granularity) and we made the house rule that it\u2019s a DC 15 survival check [once daily \u2013 represents all of your searching throughout the day] but you give up your food foraging searching for the day.</p><p>It\u2019s not a question or not of <em>whether</em> they\u2019re gonna find the stuff, just how much of it each day they can find.</p><p>They have agency in how many of their henches they put on food searching duty and how many they have chasing salve ingredients. And it\u2019s a push your luck, they want to find the salve ingredients but they also need to eat. And the more days they spend on this, the more monsters can come. Etc etc.</p><p>They know all the odds and DCs etc <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23gamist&amp;Mode=like">#gamist</a> <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23sim-engine&amp;Mode=like">#sim-engine</a></p><p>Is this inconsistent of me? Yeah, I just didn\u2019t realize until now, writing this, that it\u2019s essentially \u201csearch rolls\u201d.</p><p>But it\u2019s what the prep provides, right? If I know that the maltese falcon is behind the books on the bottom shelf in a bookshelf in room 13A in house 9C in city 3B and the PCs are sending out their army to comb the houses all over the duchy, I can negotiate a search protocol and like a visitation-order or w/e with the players and then we can calculate out when, or even if, they find the falcon without rolling, because the prep supports it.</p><p>I don\u2019t have that sort of fine-grained knowledge about where bepuga seeds grow or how much bee\u2019s wax you can gather in a day so we negotiated a rule instead. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23excuses&amp;Mode=like">#excuses</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474410/#Comment_474410" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-03T08:24:59+00:00" title="June  3, 2018  8:24AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2018 8:25AM by Rickard.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Out of philosophical curiousity: why have random encounter checks but not search checks?</p></div></blockquote><p>B/c \u201cwhere do you look?\u201d is a question for players. \u201cDo monsters come if we dwell here too long?\u201d is a question for gloracle.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nSo the answers to Search rolls are pre-planned by the game master?

Why can't there be a random stuff generator?</p></div></blockquote>\nRickard\u2665<br/>Again, this is why it's hard for me to talk DM stuff because 2097e is such an interdependent mess.<br/>Some locations, such as a room with a hidden object, have prep to the extent of "the statue is in the bookshelf behind a row of books on birch trees" and some locations, such as the pockets of a rando, have prep to the extent of "roll on this table to see what's here" and some locations even have prep to the extent of make up non-salient things here. Like for many of my houses it's fine for me to improvise the wallpaper on the spot because wallpaper appearance hasn't become salient in that particular campaign.<br/><br/>So yes, there can be and often is a random stuff generator for some locations.<br/><br/>Just as some locations are pre-keyed with specific monsters. It's the exact same thing: some things go on the key, some things go on the table, some on both.<br/><br/>However, it's not tied in to a character <i>skill</i>. Finding stuff: If the player decides to have their character look there, the character looks there. Monsters arriving: If a player decides to have their character dwell there, the character dwell there.<br/><br/>Hope that clarifies things \u2665<br/><br/><br/>If the player purposefully decides to have their character mess up in either of those two regards that can be an instance of rewardable flashlightdropping i.e. insp.<br/><br/>Comparing the Fate model to the GURPS model. In GURPS, you set your Scrounging skill (B218 \xad\u2014 the Search skill B219 is only for searching people, luggage and vehicles <small>are you kidding me right now gurps?</small>) before play starts by investing a point cost, or you can get rewarded points by taking a disad or quirk like Tends To Miss Red Objects When Searching -1.<br/><br/>Fate moves a lot of that character detail and point reward to actual play instead of leaving it front loaded. You have an aspect that helps you search things? You pay for it with points during play to use it. You have an aspect that says you are bad at searching for things? You get points during play if you fail at finding things. This is good for two reasons: if the aspect turns out to be less than relevant in the particular session you don't have to pay and/or you don't get the reward/compensation. And secondly, it lets you reconsider your choices in actual play. Perhaps you really, really want to find something even though you have a bad-at-finding aspect. In Fate you can.<br/><br/>So Fate delays some of the sculpting of the character and her behavior compared to GURPS where many decisions are frontloaded.<br/><br/>And then in 5e (or at least "2097e" my, uhm, very subjective "reading" of 5e) you don't even have to roll for finding things. You just have your character look where you want them to look. It's free. And if you have quirks, flaws etc you can get rewarded for deliberately missing.<br/><br/>So 2097e even further delays some of the character sculpting. You don't have to invest in being good at searching, have a high int/wis/cha, etc. Anyone can try to solve a puzzle, persuade a guard, look under a bed. Anyone is free to at their own leisure move along the character \u2194 player spectrum. They can think [as themselves] "This is an interesting puzzle, I'm gonna try to solve it" or [as 'authors'] "Yawn a puzzle... but having my character be unable to solve it is gonna create an interesting situation" or [as their character] "This is the sort of thing my years in the Mage School of Arachnids prepared me for! Let's see now..." and they don't have to be consistent, they can choose moment to moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474414/#Comment_474414" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-03T10:34:33+00:00" title="June  3, 2018 10:34AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2097 in the house.<br/>This is linked to zooming in / out, right ? Random stuff generators and improved salient details are a way to tell the players it's not about double guessing the GM, it's about what they want to play. And when they know, the GM follows. <br/>This gives me two meaning to "say yes or roll the dice" : 1\xb0 randomize realistic details 2\xb0 antagonize but refuse responsibility.
