Both with the game itself and the set-up beforehand (I'm tending towards coming up with the setting and at least the broad strokes of the characters collectively, rather than coming in with a setting and getting people to make individual characters).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171520/#Comment_171520" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T12:44:41+00:00" title="September 26, 2008 12:44PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My quick comment would be to use the character creation / game set up rules from version 1, and then all the play rules from version 2 (except the keynote goals from version 2, which rock). Version 1 is much better at making an ensemble of characters, while version 2 reads more like a standard "each person has their guy."<br><br>On that same point, it's important to make sure people are in it for the story, not for "their guy" to win or survive.<br><br/>Being on the same page about what genre you're trying to do is also really critical. Talk about it ahead of time.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171545/#Comment_171545" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T13:39:37+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  1:39PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like Ben says, the biggest problems I've noticed all come from bringing a "trying to win/survive" tactic from previous game experiences to Geiger Counter, instead of approaching it as "let's tell a story in which everybody dies."  The ensemble-creation approach that he's pointing at, as opposed to doing standard character creation, might help with some of that.<br/><br/>Also: take your time planning out a setting, characters, and a menace that everyone can get excited about.  You should be really drooling to watch the action go down and see how everyone dies, just like you're off to the movies to see Stargate or Alien or Scream.  If you're not excited and inspired by the premise, it'll be harder to riff on later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Why are Doc and Missy by themselves now? Clearly they just went down to the cargo bay to get tools for "the big plan." Now they get to talk alone.<br/><br/>Those random combinations push you towards making it more like a movie, less like a party with a marching order. It's part of the solid geiger gold.<br/><br/>(that's also why it's super-useful to have tokens with everyone's name on the map, so you can keep track of where people were last framed)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

I'm also planning on having a 'veto' rule during setup, as in if one person doesn't like an idea, that's all it takes not to use it; specifically so that nobody is unhappy with any part of the setting we come up with.<br/><br/>I'll definitely make sure people realise the goal is not to have 'your character' survive.<br/><br/>Cheers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
