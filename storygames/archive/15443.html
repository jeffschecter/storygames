Player B is playing Julianna Graves, Stern's secretary. They have a scene that's just about the relationships between their characters. No dice or other mechanics are invoked in this scene, it's just a character bit. Player Z watches and, when it's over, makes some judgment calls, and mechanical changes re: the relationship are made to the character sheets based on Z's decision. Maybe he picks options from a menu, or he just says to add 1 to such-and-such, I dunno.<br/><br/>Ever seen anything like this? Where?

Like, if the game says, "Reward the players for getting their characters in trouble," or, "Whenever they demonstrate that a relationship is important to them, give them more points in that Connection."<br/><br/>It generally worked out best when the principles behind the awards were as concrete as possible.  Too much room for GM judgment let to wheedling, grumpiness, and a sense of randomness.<br/><br/>Personally, I despise roleplaying toward mechanical rewards, and I dislike systems that incentivize that.  Playing toward fictional rewards that are then tracked mechanically can work, but sometimes the tracking is a superfluous hassle.  I think the key is to mediate between the fiction and the mechanical changes with something interesting and productive, not merely evaluative.  Like, Player Z looks at two lists of adjectives, picks the most appropriate one from each list, then uses those as inputs to roll a result on a table.  And then the table result adds something new into the mix, something that isn't just adj1 + adj2, and that new thing is what's incorporated into the mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350260/#Comment_350260" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-02T00:20:19+00:00" title="December  2, 2011 12:20AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A Taste for Murder.<br/><br/>Two people enter the scene, they play it out.

What about when it's not an award so much as a change? Specifically speaking, the possibilities here are a point or two going 'on the tab' for one or both of the characters, which will give a small one-time bonus in the event of that character getting into a crisis situation; an adjective or two gets put on the character sheet next to the relationship, to inform the players as they try to build the relationship subplot to crisis and resolution; adjusting the 'significance' score of the relationship for one or both characters by a point, up or down. That last one has some long-running impact on effectiveness, but should probably be the least common.<br/><br/>It's not about judging whether it's good enough; it's judging what you demonstrated about the relationship in that scene.<br/><br/>(Oh and I edited the first sentence of the OP because I had omitted a clause that left the sentence rather awkward.

So if your grandma is walking by you can grab her and as long as she watches the scene, she can contribute.

Whatcha going for with this?<br/><br/>E.T.A.:  Sorry if this isn't helpful.  You asked for folks' experiences, and the first thing that came to my mind was, "Here are some potential pitfalls you might wanna try to avoid."  On a more positive note, I will say that the ability to give a player an active role at a time when they might not otherwise have one is sweet.  I like spectating for judgment (as in Paul's game Land of Nodd) better than spectating for nothin'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350356/#Comment_350356" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-02T20:10:52+00:00" title="December  2, 2011  8:10PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <i>The Trouble with Rose</i>; the player frames a scene, throws down a domino, acts/narrates/soliloquizes their way through the scene based on the pips, and at the end the audience scores the scene (to earn your pips.)

I've never experienced this either, and it'd be nice to have a giant to stand on.</blockquote>\nYes!<br/><br/>In Bliss Stage, each player may play one or more characters, some characters may be more important/focal than others, and it's mostly relationships between characters [which different players portray] that get numerical Values (also, the level of psychological trauma characters of one specific kind suffered, which is used to track how close they are to death/leaving play and, indirectly, how close the endgame is).<br/>Leaving aside Missions (which is when you roll dice  and stuff), there are various kinds of scenes you can play, and each scene type has a specific mechanic effect (such as: increase Intimacy of a Relationship by +1, decrease Stress on a Relationship by 1, heal 1 point of Trauma, etc.).<br/>The way it works is that you cast and frame a scene, putting a bunch of characters together, but you don't declare in advance which kind of scene it is. Instead, you pick one player (one otherwise extraneous to the scene) to be the referee for that one scene: they do nothing but observe, while you roleplay character interactions. In the end, when the scene is over, the referee has to assess <i>which kind of scene it was</i> based on the fictional content of it (which they observed as audience). Mechanical consequences of the scene follow more or less automatically from this assessment, and changes in Values are thus recorded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350615/#Comment_350615" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T18:00:40+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  6:00PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Left Coast does something a little bit like this: after a scene has finished the GM and audience (people who weren't playing characters) decide if an NPC or relationship need to get added to the huge relationship map / Setting Chart that gets created through play.
