The answer, for all of us, was that we wanted to experience many of the books we had read and movies we had seen on a more  "first-hand" level. We wanted to "be" Luke Skywalker, Sinbad, and Aragorn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe took stock of all the things that we felt impeded that goal in RPGs. One of our major revelations was that the minutia of things like how long a hall in a dungeon was, or the ubiquitous empty room, and the random encounters lent absolutely nothing towards our desire for "adventure stories." Gandalf and the Fellowship never went down a "60 foot hall running north with two doors to the east and an odd sound coming from a passage branching off to the west" after all. Long story short, one of the things we started doing was writing our adventures more like outlines to stories. However, in doing so, the dungeon disappeared.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've always wondered, though, if it would be possible to run a dungeon based adventure without the dungeon. No map, no random encounters, no purposeless empty rooms. After recently reading Donjon, the idea has been playing on my mind quite a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways, I can see how it would be easily done in a similar way to how we used to "map" the old text adventure computer games (for those too young to remember, they were brilliant: look up Zork, Steve Adams, and Infocom to start). It was a kind of flow-chart from room to room. I'm wondering, though, if maybe there's another way. I'm not sure it would be very fun to have a totally linear series of encounters and rooms, but what if it was somewhat like an if/then structure? I'm not sure I can even give an example of what I'm talking about here, because it's just the inkling of an idea right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also wondering how it could be done to really make "good story."<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone experimented with this kind of play? What are some of the more interesting twists you've added to dungeon crawls? How can "story" be successfully combined with the crawl?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77944/#Comment_77944" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T17:13:35+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  5:13PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is my standard method of running dungeons.  All the normal pixelbitching and checking for traps is replaced by "You work your way through miles of winding corridors, until you come upon..." or "you crawl through the damp caves, holding the lantern in front of you.  Suddenly, its light falls upon..." and so on.  My prep looks more like a simple flowchart than a map.  Decision points are based on things like "did they succeed on a Stealth roll" or "Do they choose to fight through the main sacrifice chamber, or creep through the dungeons below", rather than "do they go left or right".<br/><br/>An important thing to remember though, if you're running D&amp;D, is that the class features are set up to take advantage of the square-by-square model of dungeoneering.  You'll have to consciously provide opportunities to  use those abilities.  <br/><br/>Interestingly, though I've had a lot of success with the above technique, for my last D&amp;D game we chose to go back to the old way.  I guess there's something fun about it.  Maybe because it lets the players use all the skills they've learnt from years of asshole GMs springing deathtraps from every door.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25" title="vertigo25"><img alt="vertigo25" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://vertigo25.com/junk/supesavatar-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25">vertigo25</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77962/#Comment_77962" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T19:01:22+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  7:01PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know... you're right about the D&amp;D rules. I had never really thought about it. I mean... I realized a long time ago that each class had certain uses, but I had never thought about how integral a lot of those things were to dungeoneering. I had always thought of the Thief class as the only one with specific things useful in a crawl. Looking at it now, though I can see how, because the rules are set up a certain way, the other classes and the races really do have their "place" in the dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm talking 1st and 2nd edition here... especially 1st. I don't really know anything about later versions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, I was definitely thinking more in terms of other games. Burning Wheel specifically.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kind of miss the dungeon, ya know? I just don't think I would have very much fun the way we used to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to have to make an attempt at this.

I think they're a hangover from old D&amp;D, where they presented the "illusion of choice".  You could go right, or left, but you'd always end up fighting the same monsters eventually.<br/><br/>Breaking from that mold allows some cool things.  Rather than tediously plotting grid squares, say you're exploring a dungeon complex, you can make a roll to find the part of the dungeon you're looking for.  Failure throws you into a different room, perhaps with exciting opportunities of its own.  Success lets you go straight to the goal.  You can make stealth rolls to get to where you're going without attracting attention, or if you fail, you get thrown into an exciting combat.  You can prep all the lose conditions ahead of time.  Rather than prepping rooms, prep "challenges", like "sneak through the maze", "get past the sleeping ogre" and so on.  <br/><br/>I hope it works out for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77981/#Comment_77981" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T22:05:18+00:00" title="June 26, 2007 10:05PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Amen. <br/><br/>But what will I do with my Barbarian cartographer?<br/><br/><br/>One thing I like to do is describe hallways in terms of approximate paces.

(Andrew is a cool name.  Everyone should be so lucky as to have it.)<br/><br/>My last several D&amp;D games I quit mapping the dungeon out grid by grid.  I just laid the map out on the table and said, "You're here at the entrance.  Where to first?"  The players told me where they were going.  I looked at the map and threw encounters at them at specific points along the way.  It worked pretty darn well and kept there from being the "60 foot long corridor..." unless the 60 foot long corridor was important for some reason.  It also made the game MUCH faster.<br/><br/>Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78236/#Comment_78236" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T15:31:31+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  3:31PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh!

One of my favorite dungeon crawls was one where I gane the players a handout which was an old and moth eaten copy-of-a-copy of some old hero's recollection of the dungeon layout.  It was cool how they'd try to second guess the map, and then when they found they couldn't get to one portion of the map they were given, they deduced that there must be a secret door.  I think the players enjoyed being able to make tactical decisions about the dungeon, based on the information they had, rather than just guessing left or right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25" title="vertigo25"><img alt="vertigo25" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://vertigo25.com/junk/supesavatar-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25">vertigo25</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78239/#Comment_78239" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T15:49:05+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  3:49PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2007 3:49PM by vertigo25.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>...
