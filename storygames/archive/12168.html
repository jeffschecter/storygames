We have clicks and locks handy, ready for use at a moment's notice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe haven't played in while though, as we have been trying several other games.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I'd have to say Burning Wheel has been our biggest influence in our gaming. Even though we haven't yet played a BW campaign together (we did play a Mouse Guard campaign). We started a Solar System campaign and Dominic decided to play a Troll similar to what is seen in the Monster Burner. Beliefs and artha have really influenced our roleplaying. And Let It Ride has become our motto in every game we play.

I think at least one reason is that my two game groups do not have a strong interest in indie games, on the whole. One group is very much a D&amp;D group (though we've played some 3:16 and dabbled with Burning Wheel). The other group doesn't play much lately, but did do much 44 playtesting, lots of Riddle of Steel, and a smattering of other game-designs-in-progress among the usual standards of Shadowrun, Mutants &amp; Masterminds, and even a brief Earthdawn stint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272623/#Comment_272623" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T11:51:40+00:00" title="May 23, 2010 11:51AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group also doesn't really have a go-to game. With that said,  there are four systems that we tend to play much more often than not: DnD3E, TSoY, nWoD, and Fudge (err... in the opposite order that I wrote them). Mostly that list is what it is because those are the games we've been playing the longest and know the best, and so we tend to default to them for longer-running games. We also have a couple of players that are relatively casual gamers or don't really like "that indie stuff," so my indie fix tends to be with a very small group or, surprisingly often, with non-gamers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272627/#Comment_272627" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T12:15:48+00:00" title="May 23, 2010 12:15PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got more-or-less three groups I play with, each with a different go-to game.<br/><br/>Group 1: Apocalypse World. We all really get the way the systems work, and I feel like our play styles mesh really well when we're playing it. I've played other games with members of this group (though never EVERY member, I think) and our Apocalypse World games invariably go better than the others.<br/><br/>Group 2: Exalted. We don't really engage the system much, and it's been heavily house-ruled, but it's how we met (!) and how we think of fantasy, and there's a lot of history there. Where our visions of the setting depart from the books, they depart in unison, which is big fun. There's so much shared history and vision there that it's just much easier to reach for it than a brand-new game where we all have to reach a consensus again.<br/><br/>Group 3: It's Complicated. People come and go, and it's more along the lines of people hanging out and itching for a one-shot than a formal weekly group or anything, but It's Complicated is the go-to game. It's easy to explain to new people, you can finish it in two hours, and it supports pretty much any genre. It's good because, for the most part, everyone likes systems which have "just enough" but not too much\u2014 so when Char's structured freeform One-Rule System isn't quite enough crunch, IC is it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272628/#Comment_272628" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T12:16:56+00:00" title="May 23, 2010 12:16PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reign.

If you have time for a bit more prep, Dogs in the Vineyard is still great and Mouse Guard gets even better.<br/><br/>For <b>I Have This Cool Campaign Idea, Let's Hack Something Together</b>, it's Mouse Guard and Apocalypse World right now.

Have you been hacking into my notes?<br/><br/>Probably the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> phenomenon I'm interested in.<br/><br/>I play in regularly in different groups, but only one is formed by people who did not meet specifically to play "indie games". It's a group that splintered from my old D&amp;D-group, to be able to play Call of Cthulhu (the D&amp;D group was really dysfunctional, after this time I think that playing CoC was more or less a way to exclude the less-desiderable people, who would never have played a game like CoC. It was easier than giving them the boot). Half of the group don't read any rpg forum, consider the idea of "rpg theory" laughable, and still play D&amp;D regularly with other groups.<br/><br/>They really surprised me. I thought that, to be able to play with them after turning to "indie-only" playing, I would have to be really careful about the games. And at first I was, trying with them only the games more "traditional" at least at first sight, like The Shadows of Yesterday or Dogs in the Vineyard.  But then I did see that they really enjoyed these games (after I became better at running them , I had a couple of false start when I didn't understand the games myself), and now they have played (with very good results) even games like Annalise or Montsegur (one of them for a time had to drop a gaming group, and she did choose to continue with Indie gaming - at the time,Annalise - and drop D&amp;D...)<br/><br/>It's not that they forgot their "kick doors, break people, take names" preferences, by the way: one of the girls declared Trollbabe "the best game ever" , and I can't wait to try S/Lay w/Me with her...  :-)<br/><br/>So, what's is happening now is that I have always a new game to try for the nights when someone is missing and we can't play the scheduled game. The last one I used was Ganakagok, and now I have S/Lay w/Me ready for the next time. I don't have a "go-to game", I have a "go-to" CATEGORY of games to try with them:  easy to explain and to setup, playable in one evening or two at most, and playable "from the heart of the character" (even if they never did read Jesse's blog "Passionate Play" they would agree to any single word, I think...)<br/><br/>I don't think that this is the kind of answer you wanted, though.

In all cases, there was something missing from the secret sauce.<br/><br/>We tried Reign, because it looks on the surface to be BWish. But the Company rules don't work as we thought they should (under all of it, it's still the GM telling you how many dice to roll), magic is a mess, and the default setting is hard to sell. There's also just the faintest hint of strong social conflict procedures baked into the game, and we greatly prefer to have that tool at our disposal.<br/><br/>We tried a couple iterations of Fate3 (SotC, Diaspora) but there's something missing there as well. I think we don't feel the Fate economy strongly enough in our play. You can arrive at a BW-like style of play but you have to bring that to the game. In our experience, the system itself doesn't do that.<br/><br/>Oh man, WFRP3! We really wanted to like this one, mostly because of the money I'd spent on it. But it's pretty rough around the edges. This is its charm for many players I think. There's lots to like about the conflict system, the die are great, but it's a high-handling-time game.<br/><br/>We've played lots of small single-premise games (Inspectres, Lacuna, 3:16, Dogs, Agon, DRYH) but the problem with those is the single-premiseness of them. They're not robust enough to handle a wide variety of ongoing games. I think we always go into our games with a long campaign in mind, even though we all acknowledge we'll probably only play 6-8 sessions of anything.<br/><br/>So for us, our go-to game has to:<br/><br/>* Be familiar to everyone, or at least learnable (BW fails on this count, truth be told -- it's a hard sell to those players who are showing up for the lulz and not To Play The Fucking Game)<br/>* Not too slow<br/>* Compact and generic-ish, so as to handle a big variety of play ideas<br/>* Have social conflict rules<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272737/#Comment_272737" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-24T05:42:06+00:00" title="May 24, 2010  5:42AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>Uses as its "lingua franca,"</blockquote>\n[I was just writing a whole post about establishing lingua franca in our loose meetup gaming group.

They might end up selling everyone else on it or we might find the thing they like exists in another game we want to play. Or if they mainly care about the setting, then their favorite book or TV show might be a terrible fit for D&amp;D and if we focus on finding the right game to fit their actual interests... it's not too hard of a sell. <br/><br/>Ultimately a lot of these groups aren't even playing D&amp;D or Pathfinder in ways I recognize, so even specifying a game isn't enough to understand what's really going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272837/#Comment_272837" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-24T13:59:15+00:00" title="May 24, 2010  1:59PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our (my) go-to games are PTA and The Pool.

But I just realized that observation it not at all true; in fact, interpreting "story game" broadly, we do have go-to games. The thing is, they aren't roleplaying games (in the traditional sense) at all.<br/><br/>We we want to play a roleplaying game, there is often excitement for DnD, TSOY, Werewolf, etc., but more often than not rpgs don't even come up. Instead, the first suggestions are inevitably for Bang!, Citadels, or Gloom. Gloom is, imho, one of the best story games there is (when "story-game" is broadly interpreted), and we also play Bang! and Citadels in a narrative fashion, which is to say that we augment the competitive nature of the game with involved fiction. (Everyone narrates, sometimes extensively, on their turn.)<br/><br/>My initial impulse was that adding on narration to another game doesn't really make it a story game, since (in my personal formulation) the fiction must influence the mechanical elements as well as vice versa. (That's why I don't think chess, for example, is a story game, though you can certainly narrate along with a game.) What I realized after last night, though, is that-- at least with how we play Bang and Gloom, and to a certain extent even with Citadels and Risk-- our fiction actually significantly influences the play of the game. Because of our collective buy-in to the fiction, we began making sub-optimal choices (in the game theory sense)-- that is, the goal of "winning" was to a certain extent redefined and subjugated to the fiction.<br/><br/>That was a bit of a ramble, but it struck me as significant that our go-to games, <i>even when we want fiction-centric play</i>, tend to be agon-centric games played in an unconventional way (i.e. with multiple goals-- someone wins Citadels by victory points, but some else wins by building a city with only unique buildings, or only military/religious buildings in support of their theme of theocratic autocracy, and so forth). Our go-to games aren't story games from the rpg tradition, but they sure as hell feel a lot like story games when we play them!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zartes" title="Zartes"><img alt="Zartes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zartes">Zartes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273638/#Comment_273638" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-30T04:46:32+00:00" title="May 30, 2010  4:46AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, it's MicroLite20. It's not really a story game. Correction: it isn't a story game. At all. It's actually just D&amp;D cut down to a level where I can remember or improvise all the rules. Which is why it's MY go-to. Most of my group are casual gamers, so that's fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
