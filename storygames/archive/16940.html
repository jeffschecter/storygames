So I updated it with the latest drafts of what I have.  In particular there are three new games.<br/><br/>Haunted - I wrote this for the Ronnies.  It's in the play test section because I actually ran it once with a great deal of success.  I'm in the process of revising the game and its got some major changes from the one provided here but it isn't ready for posting yet.<br/><br/>A Dark and Quiet Place - My dream game is to produce a game based on the thematic dynamics of Silent Hill 2.  This is like my 4th or 5th attempt.  It was written for Jonathan Walton's video game based competition.  I have never playtested it and my current fear is that it's too constrained and maybe too board gamey.<br/><br/>Bread Mold Might Be Medicine - I wrote this for one of the mini game chefs.  I like it a lot and think it's quite playable though I have yet to playtest it myself.  The goal is create a game that captures the feel of films like PAX or Neverwas where a patient turns out to be better therapy for a doctor and those around him.<br/><br/>If you play of these games please let me know.  Even better, if you would LIKE to play any of these games please let me know.  I have recently discovered how easy it is run games via Google Hangouts or Skype and would love to set something up if there's interest.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
