I've played it once before with someone else GMing it, but that was a while ago. We did start off late, and along the way I was explaining rules. So we didn't get to do as much as I was hoping, but everyone did have fun.<br/><br/>The players picked the Nest of Vipers Oracle. The cards drawn were:<br/><br/>An innkeeper who murders and robs his wealthy guests<br/>A baby\u2019s birth, heralded by prophets, written of in antique books, forseen by the wise.<br/>The ghost of a suicide, a person overcome by guilt and shame, who finds in death no release.<br/>A warehouse on the docks, full of stolen silk and fine stuff.<br/><br/>After some quick brainstorming, the players came up with their characters.<br/><br/>Ugurnaszir, a wealthy merchant and criminal who bribes dockworkers to steal from other merchants for his own acquisition and sales. His best interests were to stay safe while residing at the inn, and to force Mirza to keep working for him.<br/>Sorme, The ghost of the Innkeeper\u2019s wife, who killed herself out of regret for helping her husband murder his guests yet is unable to pass on from her own sorrow. Her best interests were to chase away the guests from the inn and to kill Jesper, the murderous innkeeper.<br/>Mirza, a dockworker who smuggles merchandise and father of the baby heralded by prophets. His best interests were to protect his baby at all costs, and to betray Ugurnaszir and make off with his money to start a better life.<br/><br/>I ran 2 NPCs: Awita, one of the wise prophets and Jesper, the murderous innkeeper. Awita's best interests were to take the baby of prophecy for herself and get rid of the ghost in the inn. Jesper's best interests were to kill and rob Ugurnaszir and kill the baby of prophecy (this second one didn't actually come up during play though).<br/><br/>The first scene had Sorme come across Jesper preparing a meal for Ugurnaszir. He was about to put poison in, so she quickly took action. Sorme attempted to sabatoge the effort by lightly increasing the heat on the stove up and tip over the jar. He wins the first exchange, so she increases her efforts and turns the heat way up. She wins, and rather then exhaustion/injury the player goes for causing the jar to fall and break while Jesper is distracted so that he's out of his poison for now. I agree, and now Jesper has to scramble to bring the meal to a very impatient Ugurnaszir.<br/><br/>In the next scene Mirza brings some stolen goods to Ugurnaszir at the warehouse, who has a jolly time laughing at him. Mirza grits his teeth and reminds himself that he's doing this for his child. Meanwhile, at the inn Sorme comes across a woman talking to Jesper. It's Awita, asking if anything unusual has been going on. Jesper mentions the jar falling over, the stove heating up, and a few other things. He doesn't think anything of it, but Awita is convinced otherwise. She asks him if anything big has ever happened at the inn. Before Jesper can answer, Sorme interferes by shattering a plate nearby. Awita practically jumps out of her seat, and in the next exchange Sorme yanks on her clothing to spook her even more. Sorme's player outright wins the conflict, and we negotiate on Awita getting freaked out and leaving before finding out about Sorme's suicide.<br/><br/>A few days later, Mirza is waiting outside while Ugurnaszir is meeting with important people inside the inn while carrying his baby with him. He notices a cart belonging to Ugurnaszir, which could contain valuables. A guard is nearby, and Mirza attempts to sneak by. He rolls against Ugurnaszir's player, who is using his far reaching Strength of Bodyguards (he had this one watch over the cart while the other is with him). They tie in the first exchange, and both decide to back down - Mirza since he has his child with him, and Ugurnaszir's guard since he figured it was just some random noise.<br/><br/>When Mirza heads out, Awita approaches him and talks about how cute his baby is. She spins a sob story about having lost her own daughter and asks to hold the baby just for a moment. Mirza politely refuses, so Awita resorts to trickery. When he's not looking, she flicks dust in the baby's eyes causing her to cry. She steps forward and offers to help calm the baby down. Mirza is suspicious and backs away. His player wins the exchange and chooses to injure Awita. Mirza heads back near the guard so that someone else is nearby and sweep kicks Awita off her feet. She falls down, hits her head, and then runs off.<br/><br/>At this point it was getting really late, so I decided to wrap things up with one final scene.<br/><br/>Jesper approaches Mirza on Ugurnaszir's final day at the inn. He tells Mirza that he has the key to the room, and they can run in and quickly rob Ugurnaszir before he knows what happened. Mirza agrees, and the two head up to his room. Sorme sees them going up, but before she can follow Awita bursts in with a priest talking about a "malevolent spirit."  The priest tells her they can put the spirit to rest, and begins chanting rites as Awita pulls out protective charms and joins in. Mirza and Jesper head right into a surprised Ugurnaszir's room, who greets them in a somewhat friendly manner that ends when Jesper takes out a poisoned dagger and attempts to kill him. Mirza is shocked, but just starts grabbing anything valuable he can get his hands on.<br/><br/>Sorme attempts to resist the efforts of the priest and Awita, but her player blows the roll and loses the conflict. Rather then being sent away, she accepts getting injured as Sorme barely holds herself together.<br/><br/>Ugurnaszir grabs a nearby chamberpot to defend himself while yelling for his guards who show up and get involved. Ugurnaszir's player rolls incredibly high in the second exchange, and neither Jesper or Mirza can get over half his result. I offer the option of Jesper being killed and Ugurnaszir's player naturally accepts. Jesper gets his skull bashed in with a dirty chamberpot before getting run through a bodyguard's spear. Ugurnaszir turns to Mirza and gives him his ultimatum - give his baby to be raised by Ugurnaszir and work for only room, food, and board, or be killed. Mirza refuses and fights his way past the guards, getting injured in the process. He runs past a confused priest and an angry Awita yelling to Sorme about how she'll find her. Meanwhile, Sorme quickly destroys Jesper's poisons before lying down and passing on.<br/><br/>Some things I noticed I didn't do well were ensuring everyone got to go after their Best Interests. Ugurnaszir's first one was pretty passive and he didn't get to face the second one until the end. Sorme didn't get a chance to scare off guests, and Jesper's second Best Interest didn't come into play at all. Looking at it now, that might have been good - Awita and Jesper could have come into conflict, which I didn't want since they're both NPCs. It's possible being low on time contributed to this, but it's something I'll keep in mind for next time. I had to nudge the players a bit too, so in the future I'll encourage them to be more aggressive or see if they want me to frame scenes that will help them move towards their Best Interests.<br/><br/>I also felt I didn't do a good job threatening PCs where they are weak. The thing is though that the players generally used their highest forms all the time. Should I have set up situations where the most likely actions would involve lower die forms? Sorme and Mirza did each end up being on the Owe list once at least.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428318/#Comment_428318" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-16T03:46:04+00:00" title="February 16, 2014  3:46AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it is on you to attack them where they're weak. The players should be using smaller dice if they're interested in having the character return in the next chapter. However, the GM should be looking at the best interests and putting players into positions where the character is either at a sudden but temporary advantage that prompts action, or where their Best Interests are being thwarted or potentially thwarted unless they take action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428320/#Comment_428320" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-16T08:33:25+00:00" title="February 16, 2014  8:33AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree: I think the players will quickly learn that using their lower dice is the only way for the characters to "stay alive", so to speak. If you want to play your character for any length of time, you've got to maneuver so as to use some lower dice or you'll write yourself out of the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
