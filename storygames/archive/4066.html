I bring this up because I've been in two one-shots in which I had rather mediocre experiences (no offense to the GMs) because I didn't really get the game. Having not read the book, all I knew is that I was a Mormon-ish teenager given the duty of enforcing God's Law. <br/><br/>Now, perhaps <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Camp" rel="nofollow">Jesus Camp</a> warped my mind, but that description screamed "religious zealot" to me, giving me a black-and-white mentality that did not allow for the moral ambiguity and conflict that (I'm told) is the awesomeness of Dogs. So I should be introducing a competing value or goal to complicate my allegience to the Book of Life? Call me dense, but it would really help if the GM mentioned that, because it's not intuitive from the rules/mechanics (for me).<br/><br/>So, what do you tell new players? How do you push moral conflicts when all the players know is that they're in charage of upholding the Book of Life? What do you do to explain the "fun?" Is it just me, or does Dogs suffer from this problem (the conflict does not obviously derive from the rules/mechanics) more than other games?<br/><br/>I bring this up not to dog on Dogs (sorry, I had to), but to encourage GMs to be a bit more guiding for first-time players.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90764/#Comment_90764" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T14:19:09+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  2:19PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My two bits - would it help if you told them that the point of the game is that they, as players get to decide how much of the Book is true?<br/><br/>Because, correct me if I'm wrong, that is the unspoken point.<br/><br/>- Elliott                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90768/#Comment_90768" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T14:33:35+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  2:33PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2007 2:33PM by Denys.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elliot -- That's an excellent suggestion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/devilmaycare" title="devilmaycare"><img alt="devilmaycare" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/devilmaycare">devilmaycare</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90770/#Comment_90770" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T14:47:30+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  2:47PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliott Belser</cite>My two bits - would it help if you told them that the point of the game is that they, as players get to decide how much of the Book is true?<br/><br/>Because, correct me if I'm wrong, that is the unspoken point.<br/><br/>- Elliott</blockquote>\nIt's a moral code, not a scientific treatise.

But, I don't think that is the optimal way to play Dogs.  I think everybody needs to get together for an evening to make characters.  Talk about your backgrounds.  Suggest traits and relationships for each other and develop your characters history.  Most importantly here would be to not foll what seems to be standard advice of "leave most of your relationship dice unassigned."  Assign those dice, and by doing so, tell everybody who is important to your character and why.  After characters are made, leave the sheets with the GM so he can build towns around those relationships and traits.  It may be easy to gun down a sinner for making pacts with demons, but what if they didn't realize what they were doing before it was too late?  Still an easy decision; what if it was your sister?<br/><br/>If somebody wants to run and five town campaign (I'm not talented enough to do this) I'd be happy to drive down and help give you a better Dogs experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90775/#Comment_90775" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T14:57:18+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  2:57PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: devilmaycare</cite>, as a player, don't believe any of it.

These players use the classic if Demons result from Sin then doesn't that prove the "truth" of the sin and therefore I'd be playing "out of character" to do anything other than shoot sinners on sight.  There are three sections of the book I point to to clear this matter up.  Unfortunately, I don't have the book with me at the moment so I can't quote exactly and I can't give page numbers but trust me all three of these concepts are in there.<br/><br/>1) I point to the place where it says that Dogmatists are listed among the Unfaithful.  That to simply treat the Book of LIfe as a list of unbreakable laws is to be unfaithful.<br/><br/>2) I point to the place where it says that the King of Life is a pragmatist.  That the King of LIfe would rather two people have pre-martial sex in true love if their were extenuating circumstances as to why they couldn't get married first.<br/><br/>3) I point to the place where it says that demons lose their power over sinners the moment the Dogs condone the sinful activity.  I believe this is in the scenario with the greedy shop keepers.  It mentions that the demons *DON'T* want the Dogs to side with the shop keeper because then the demons would lose their power.<br/><br/>These three principles serve to eliminate both the "in character" dogmatist argument and the "reality of the supernatural proves truth" argument.  The only thing left is for the players to judge the situation based on common humanist principles even if those principles are filtered through their "in character" point of view.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/devilmaycare" title="devilmaycare"><img alt="devilmaycare" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/devilmaycare">devilmaycare</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90778/#Comment_90778" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T15:03:33+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  3:03PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jesse!

The question of how much faith your Dog has is an interesting one, but let's leave that to the side for now.<br/><br/>Just for fun, here in this thread, let's say that all Dogs are true black-and-white believers who don't question a single sentence of the Book of Life.<br/><br/>The fun of play is this: What will you do to enforce that doctrine on others? Each player has to answer that question, over and over again, for themselves (the players) and their characters. All while the GM escalates the stakes of that question more and more.<br/><br/>Like this: Your Dog believes with all her heart that adultery is a serious sin. No question about it, no loopholes in the book. You find out about two adulterers. What do you do about them? You have an array of choices, from talking to killing.<br/><br/>Then: What if they won't repent? What if they try to start a new faith where adultery is okay? What if they draw guns and tell you to fuck off back to Bridal Falls City? What if they're overcome with shame and want to kill themselves? And on and on.<br/><br/>That's all fantastic stuff for play, and it's not contingent on your Dog's own journey in the faith.

Why is your character a Dog if she doesn't believe it all? <br/><br/>Does she believe it some? Does she believe it none? Did her father always want her to be a Dog and talk non-stop about it ever since she was yay high? Now her father can be proud of her....but wait isn't pride a sin? Is she helping her father continue in his sinful pride by living this lie? Exactly who is she willing to hurt in order to keep up this charade? Her community spent every spare penny it had making her that coat she wears. Its a beautiful coat. She wears it with pride. There's that pride thing again. Is she a Dog simply out of her own prideful need to live up to her community's expectations? Maybe she's not a Dog, not really. Not where it counts. Maybe she knows deep down in her heart she's a sinner too. She's a fake. Now what's her answer when she finds those two adulterers, knowing she has sinned just like them? Does she shoot em? <br/><br/>Morally ambiguous enough for ya?<br/><br/>(Also, I'd make sure to judge the game after playing it with an experienced GM who knows the mechanics really well)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90843/#Comment_90843" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T23:41:24+00:00" title="August 27, 2007 11:41PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WillH</cite>I have heard one of the reasons the faith is not very well defined is you are supposed to project yourself onto the dogs and come into conflict with your fellow dogs.

When you dig through the game text, there's almost nothing to stand on in terms of being dogmatic. Its like you took Declaration in SOTC. When its your turn to quote scripture, almost anything you make up could be workable.<br/><br/>And what little dogma there is often reads like this "It's a sin to harm or kill another person, <em>unless you have just cause</em>"<br/>Or "pride can enter into Stewardship when...you think you can do a better job than the Steward." But what if you're right? "If the Steward doesn't live up to his obligations, he's committed the sin of Faithlessness hasn't he?"<br/><br/>If the text said "Murder is sin <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. Nothing is worse than a murderer." There would be no doubt. If the text said the Steward is always right, there would be no doubt.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I'd be playing "out of character" to do anything other than shoot sinners on sight.</blockquote>\nInterestingly, the game doesn't say what you should do when confronted by sinners. It doesn't say ride into town and shoot sinners. It doesn't say not to.

I felt like a young boy defrocked at prom time... er... so to speak. What I could do and what I had to accept as the ramifications of my actions... wow... you just won't ever see a D&amp;D paladin having to deal with the same levels of confusion and social dysfunction that a game of dogs can inspire.

[Check out zeitgeistmovie.com and then play Over the Edge.]<br/><br/>But the beauty of dogs, for me, is that the game never tells me how to handle things. Yet it supports any level of religious dogma I want to pursue in my game. Effectively letting someone play a fundamentalist terrorist if they wanted to. Hell, you do play Dogs KKK, if you wanted... but I don't think anyone would recommend that.<br/><br/>&gt; Interestingly, the game doesn't say what you should do when confronted by sinners. It doesn't say ride into town and shoot sinners. It doesn't say not to. Just that its your job to fix things.<br/><br/>Yep. Perfect.<br/><br/>And man, does that open so many creative doors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/warren" title="warren"><img alt="warren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wmerrifield.googlepages.com/GoPlayMario.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/warren">warren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90863/#Comment_90863" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T02:27:45+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  2:27AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Although others have all said pretty much the same (I really like John Harper's advice), this is what I have said to my new players, more or less:<br/><br/>You have the Book of Life, and Doctrine is based on what it says, right? But it is <i>not</i> the Dog's job to blindly follow Doctrine (in my opinion, that's what Stewards are for). Remember, The King of Life is pragmatic, and allows those He has deemed worthy to judge exceptions to Doctrine in order to preserve the Faith as a whole. <i>That</i> is the job of the Watchdogs. If a watchdog is simply following Doctrine with no thought to the situation, then he is not doing his job, and is a bad dog.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90865/#Comment_90865" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T02:30:51+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  2:30AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run Dogs for a few new tables and I've never gotten all that philosophical with how I introduced it.<br/><br/>Here's a few things I make sure to say:  <br/><br/>"We are going to play Dogs in the Vineyard, a game about teenage paladins with a Mandate from God with guns in a wild west that never was.  You are going to roll into town and the town is going to have troubles and it will be up to you all to decide how to make those troubles better.  I won't tell you that your decisions are right or wrong, all I'll do is up the ante and bring on the consequences.<br/><br/>You aren't going to have to look all that hard.<br/><br/>As your teachers told ya:<br/><br/>'If life was perfect, you'd all name babies and deliver the mail but life ain't perfect.'<br/><br/>The other important thing your teachers at Bridal Falls said was:<br/><br/>'Sometimes you have to cut off the arm to save the life.'<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>'We don't love you; we love the congregations you are going to go out and help.'<br/><br/>Training was rough.<br/><br/>Let's start character generation."<br/><br/>That does it.<br/><br/>As the game begins, most people are excited to play a character with a mandate from a higher power.  By the end of the game, everyone feels the terrible weight of that mandate and realizes that no one should have to shoulder such a thing in life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91020/#Comment_91020" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T10:23:58+00:00" title="August 28, 2007 10:23AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2007 10:24AM by viktor_haag.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't seen anyone add this comment so far: have you thought of playing "Princes Kingdom" as an introduction to Dogs? From reading it, I thought one of the things it did really well was boil the ethical conflict down into a much smaller set of choices, and put them in terms that were more easily understood from a modern secular point of view.<br/><br/>The code of ethics in Dogs is excellently framed, but it isn't short 'n sweet, nor is it immediately accessible to the modern secular person. Of course, it does resonate, as is demonstrated by that "aha! the light bulb just went on moment" that seems so widely reported amongst DitV actual play reports; I find that the "light bulb" phenomenon is symptomatic of games that aren't immediately accessible, but have a strong undercurrent that can be connected to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91104/#Comment_91104" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T14:30:56+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  2:30PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            jim pinto said:<br/>"you just won't ever see a D&amp;D paladin having to deal with the same levels of confusion and social dysfunction that a game of dogs can inspire."<br/><br/>i say, sure you can!  you just play that d&amp;d paladin using the dogs system.  in fact, given that i think myself and my players had a bit of trouble "connecting" with dogs because of the western setting, this might be something i'll have to consider...  along with the "jedis in the vineyard" idea i've heard mentioned before... i think on have games, will travel.<br/><br/>-brian                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91108/#Comment_91108" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T14:41:30+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  2:41PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            brian:<br/><br/>is that a D&amp;D paladin in the vineyard? or are you just glad to see me?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
