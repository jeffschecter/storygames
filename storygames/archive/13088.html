But I do think he instinctively rejects the notion that he could be extraordinary or could thrive somewhere.  He idealizes himself as a survivor, not as a conqueror or captain of insight.  <br/><br/>Look at this passage from the end--when he sees things with clarity and begins to judge, he instinctively follows up with denial:\n<blockquote>I stop, picturing him there behind me with his ridiculous head sticking out of the passenger-side window, but I cannot turn around.

The gifted kids game is the better game of the two; the other one is the stuff of countless RPG.net threads where the right answer is always "Dude, you should quit that game". The fact that the narrator prefers it suggests that he feels like he "belongs" to that game; he thinks he deserves the punishment he gets from the Dungeon Master.<br/><br/>Or, possibly, D&amp;D in this story is just a backdrop, just the thing this (somewhat) socially-maladjusted kid does that brings him into contact with other people. So the other game, the "good" game, is the author going out of his way to not indict or blame D&amp;D for the fucked-upedness of these kids.<br/><br/>Regardless, I think most everyone here has probably known SOMEONE in their gaming lives who strongly resembled the title character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295180/#Comment_295180" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T10:32:26+00:00" title="September 29, 2010 10:32AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>The story was less about D&amp;D and more about personal dynamics and growth.

Five pages into it, after five pages of racist bullshit that was mostly meaningless to me, ("Seriously, you're Puerto Rican, Dominican, whatever?
