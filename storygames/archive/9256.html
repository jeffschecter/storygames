Long ago, I ran something similar (using GURPS) and the adventure involved one of the players being a Terminator. Now, I'd like to do it again, and I love the idea of one of the characters being a Terminator and thinking about how to do it...using The Mountain Witch.<br/><br/>To put TMW through a Terminator lens, the PCs would be Tech Com troopers on a mission to penetrate Skynet's CPU Center (maybe inside Cheyenne Mountain?) and destroy it - a total suicide mission, yes? All of the Dark Fates could be in use, but I change one, maybe Worst Fear (because I've never liked that one very much) to Terminator! (as in, you are a Terminator!)<br/><br/>The question "Why does your character need the money" from the original TMW, becomes, "Why did your character volunteer for a suicide mission?"<br/><br/>Then, basically play as normal, throwing stuff at the players until they pop and/or the Terminator character's cover is blown and it's time to rock.<br/><br/>I dunno, maybe not even do the Terminator PC thing since I can't think of a good reason why a Terminator wouldn't just blow all the humans away the moment they all got together in one place.<br/><br/>I don't usually do drastic setting conversions with any games I run, but I've run TMW as a oneshot several times now and I feel fairly confident with it.<br/><br/>Thoughts? Ideas for bangs? I'm all ears.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204872/#Comment_204872" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T02:23:30+00:00" title="May  2, 2009  2:23AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>I dunno, maybe not even do the Terminator PC thing since I can't think of a good reason why a Terminator wouldn't just blow all the humans away the moment they all got together in one place.</blockquote>\nTry to learn more about the resistance movement through "casual conversation" with its "comrades", perhaps?

Did you actually play this? I <i>really</i> like the idea, and in fact I'm tempted to run some sort of tMW-Terminator hack at Camp Nerdly this weekend.<br/><br/>But I've been thinking about the PC-Terminator thing, and I'm just not sure how well it will work in play. This is a bit of a bummer, since again, I really like the idea of a PC Terminator...<br/><br/>Well, a secret Terminator would probably work fine, especially if it was some sort of new prototype Terminator imprinted with actual human memories or programmed with advanced emotional AI (for better infiltration into human ranks)... Though honestly, at that point the "Terminator" fate starts sounding a lot like a variant of "Unholy Pact". So if you wanted balance, it might be better to swap that fate out, rather than "Worst Fear".<br/><br/>Making the PC Terminator a reprogrammed model ala Arnie or Cameron is certainly interesting and consistent with the source material, but after some thought, it seems like it might be too narrow. I mean, we all know what's going to happen---the model's old programming is going to re-surface, and they're going to start going after the other PCs. What else do you do with that character?<br/><br/>No, really---what else <i>can</i> you do with that character? I like the idea, but I can't think of a way to make it interesting.<br/><br/>One thing that popped in my head would be to add "Reprogrammed Terminator" as a special seventh fate, and then make some sort of special rules for that one player/character. Like, maybe... maybe the reprogrammed Terminator doesn't have a normal "dark fate" (which would mean the model wouldn't betray the party... <i>probably</i>...), but the player has some other sort of directorial power to compensate? And maybe the reprogrammed Terminator can't use Trust, but the mechanics somehow work differently for them?... But I don't know, those are just vague musings, not usable ideas... And the specifics are going to be important, because you don't want to imbalance play...<br/><br/>Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Or any other general ideas for a tMW-Terminator hack?<br/><br/><br/>PS---Oh, one quick idea: The players could still use the zodiacs for beginning Trust levels, but the actual zodiac labels/descriptions could be swapped out for different factions or nationalities within the Resistance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209224/#Comment_209224" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-27T07:07:56+00:00" title="May 27, 2009  7:07AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2009 7:08AM by timfire.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Double post...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209543/#Comment_209543" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-29T09:13:04+00:00" title="May 29, 2009  9:13AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ran this just last night and it was awesome! In the end, only one character survived. <br/><br/>I barely modified the game at all. I changed the zodiacs for different factions within the resistance. <br/>I gave each faction just a bit of backstory and the players filled in the rest. <br/><br/>Tech Com<br/>Nor Com<br/>Cent Com<br/>Atlantic Com<br/>Mex Com<br/>Euro Zone<br/><br/>Other than that, no changes. Of course, things like tengu became T-800s or what have you, but that was simply a matter of figuring out the various Terminator models and other Skynet robots and giving them a strength rating.<br/><br/>The Fates were used with no modifications. The Unholy Pact fate turned out the way you might have expected - the player decided her character was a Terminator, and when this was revealed, wow, it was insane!<br/><br/>In the game I did things like run truckloads of prisoners past the strike team as they infiltrated the Skynet factory complex (of course, some of the prisoners were known to individual PCs). There were huge blazing firefights with HK Tanks, moments of high paranoia (involving one PC shoving another into an MRI machine to see if he was human or not), hacking and hijacking of automated trucks, and once inside Skynet's Cheyenne Mountain stronghold, encounters with the liquid metal T-1000s (whose shape changing and mimicry are absolutely PERFECT for this game).<br/><br/>When everything blew up, it was totally nuts! The PC who had Desperately In Love found a container full of identical bodies. I told him they all look like someone in the party - who was it? He chose the player who had the Unholy Pact (at random no less) and this caused everything to blow up. She revealed herself as a Terminator and they shot each other. It was a Duel and the human PC got the beter of the Terminator PC in the roll and took her out. Then the Revenge PC tossed a satchel charge into the room (because the In Love character was responsible for his brother's death) and took *him* out. The 4 survivors made it to the deepest part of the complex, where a T-1000 took out the Revenge PC, and then another PC who inadvertently used his black box comm unit (while trying to contact his friend who he thought was inside) to alert Skynet to their presence and compromise the Resistance communication net!<br/><br/>The two survivors got to the power core and started wiring it to blow, and I brought in another T-1000 and I let the player say who it looked like. "It's him" he said and indicated his fellow PC! So there they are, the one guy freaking out because there are two of his comrade standing there, and both are arguing the other is the imposter and hurry up and kill him so we can blow this place! The conflicted PC, whose Worst Fear was getting captured, put his gun in his mouth and killed himself!<br/><br/>With that, the remaining PC opened fire on his doppleganger and took him out (they had full-on plasma rifles capable of taking out Terminators). The last scene was of him setting the timer on the detonator and running for the exit.<br/><br/>I should also mention I ran this in my usual 4-hour format, and it was great!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210035/#Comment_210035" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T10:42:43+00:00" title="June  2, 2009 10:42AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally got all ready to play this at Nerdly, but when I got everyone together to play, a few people weren't into the idea, so I ended up running the standard samurai setting. At some point I would still like to run this hack, though...<br/><br/>For the ill-fated game last weekend, I was planning on simply changing "Unholy Pact" to "You are a Terminator". But in case anyone else is interested, I just had <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9458&amp;page=1#Item_19" rel="nofollow">an idea for a BSG hack</a>, which could also work here.<br/><br/>You could hand out the Fates as normal, and <i>then</i> make the players draw a second card from a different deck that specifies whether the character is a human or Terminator. In the second deck, you could have maybe 7 or 8 cards, but only one of them would be a "Terminator" card. That way, you honestly don't know if someone in the group is a machine, and the Terminator character could be connected to different Fates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210103/#Comment_210103" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T22:31:29+00:00" title="June  2, 2009 10:31PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that if I did this again, I would just do the same thing and not designate anyone as a Terminator, just let the players decide if that's the way they wanted to go with their dark fates. The Unholy Pact is the most obvious path to a character turning out to be a Terminator, but looking back on my game, I no longer think there's a need to force it. The player who had Unholy Pact said after the game that the moment she saw the card, she decided her character was a Terminator. She had never played TMW before so that's why I think such a connection seems fairly easy to make, and still gives the players complete freedom over their character's dark fate.<br/><br/>I also want to say that with TMW's focus on trust, and Skynet's ability to send Terminators that can look like anyone, including the PCs themselves, this aspect of the Terminator universe makes it a great fit for playing out a story using TMW.<br/><br/>I was fortunate enough to have a great deal of group buy-in of the concept and it helped a lot in play- when I posted this game on the FLGS forum I frequent, all 6 seats were filled up within 24 hours and everyone seemed really stoked to play. Maybe I just nailed a wave of enthusiasm since the movie had just come out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
