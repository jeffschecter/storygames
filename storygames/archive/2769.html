The DS's have adhoc connections, so 5 friends meet at a coffee shop and run an instance rather than sitting separately and spamming a channel with LFM.  5 strangers at a con, or less likely, by happenstance could have some hand held platform on them and get together to accomplish something in game.  <br/><br/>What if, they were to go a step beyond and ad a geocashing or flash mob aspect to it?  Assuming some hand held has GPS functionality, what if Dungeon X only exists at a specific location?  There could be events that require players to amass themselves and interact socially.    <br/><br/>It's not very SG, but it's just something that stuck me, on my ride home from work                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63164/#Comment_63164" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-06T17:20:43+00:00" title="April  6, 2007  5:20PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I worked for a mobile phone game company a few years ago, I was investigating some of the located-based games out there.  I especially had fun playing around with <a href="http://www.mogimogi.com/mogi.php?language=en" rel="nofollow">Mogi</a>.  Basically it's a virtual treasure hunt where prizes are superimposed on a real GPS-created map of Tokyo.  The first person running the game on their mobile who traveled over the actual place where the prize was located would "collect" it.<br/><br/>We were talking about some cool fantasy MMO ideas where the game would take real places in a GPS map and replace them with fantasy items.  So "gas station" becomes "magic shop" or "golf course" becomes "dragon's lair".  The US mobile market was (and still is) a little too conservative for this type of game to get much traction.  But you could certainly create one.  Here are some other <a href="http://www.in-duce.net/archives/locationbased_mobile_phone_games.php" rel="nofollow">games</a> that have been made.<br/><br/>I think you could make a much richer game experience on the DS, but with the ad-hoc wifi, there's no connection to a central server that knows where each DS is located in real-space and there's no GPS on the DS.<br/><br/>But yeah, this type of technology really opens up interesting new possibilities of augmented interaction with real people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63168/#Comment_63168" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-06T19:56:57+00:00" title="April  6, 2007  7:56PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can plug stuff into a DS though, so a GPS dooflotchie can be added on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63172/#Comment_63172" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-06T21:51:02+00:00" title="April  6, 2007  9:51PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you have a big enough memory card there are actually a few MMOs that you can run on the PSP. Beyond MMOs there are lots of neat multi player games that can be played on handhelds. I'm looking forward to playing multi-player Gadget Trial whe the game is finally released later this year. I've played Monster Hunter (which is kind of a 4 player MMO similar to Phantasy Star Online) with people here in town before and it was tons of fun. I think there's a lot of neat possibilities for MMOs that can be carried around and played whenever. Voice communication software is the key to portable but non-face-to-face video game roleplaying I think. I've been trying to find a roger wilco type program that runs well on the PSP, but so far haven't. <br/><br/>jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63173/#Comment_63173" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-06T21:52:48+00:00" title="April  6, 2007  9:52PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is true, but it's hard to reach any critical mass of users with something you need to add on.

Or just package it with the game.<br/><br/><br/>But if you got such a game for the DS, I'd expect these capabilities to be extremely limited.  Nintendo is terrified of being attached to any sort of "internet sexual predator" news story, and so tightly controls plyer interactions using the wifi stuff.  So while you may be able to meet with your friends in person, the game probably wouldn't help you meet other folks playing the game who happen to be next door to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
