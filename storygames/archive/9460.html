This seems as good a place as any to give that to him.<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">STORY GAMES POWER, ACTIVATE!</span><br/><br/>I have not been able to play the game yet and I have not been able to read the rules with the thoughtfulness I desire (I'm at work, sorry.)  I'm also not familiar with the genre of manga that the game emulates, though I can pretty much understand the ideas 4-part, high school, slice-of-life, and game.  With that disclaimer, I have the following for you so far.<br/><br/>First, is the intention that the players will all be playing female characters?  The consistent use of feminine pronouns and the nature of the Quirks list suggests it, but it doesn't seem to be explicitly stated in the rules.<br/><br/>If the expectation is a mixed cast, about half the Quirks are female-only or female-oriented; I may have moobs, but I'd not consider myself "busty."  This leaves the boys with slim pickings to fill out their quirk list, which will likely lead to significant overlap.  If the mixed-cast assumption is correct, re-skinning some of the traits will allow greater flexibility in characters, even though the overall number seems to be about correct.<br/><br/>If you want more opportunities for Memories, you could add more combination to the list.  Looking to Poker for inspiration: sequences (straights,) pairs and trips in different positions (trips on the first three parts could mean that the scene was resolved, but someone wasn't happy with it as one example.)  One of each suit.  All odds, all evens, all special (face) cards. No special cards in the final tally.  Since you have wild cards being played perpendicular to the rest, there is the opportunity to recognize when they are played (no wilds in a phase, more than X wilds played in a phase....)<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you wanted some physical representation of a memory, how about making a "yearbook" or "scrapbook."  Have a 4-panel play aid, and by some method of determination, each player adds in some way to their panel for that scene.  So, if the determination method said I make the <i>shou</i> panel, I would draw, write, compose or in whatever way I felt I could, add the <i>shou</i> panel for that page.  Each scene has it's own page, leaving a keepsake of the game.  Possibly a bit too artsy-craftsy, time may be a consideration, and it does lock in a 4-player "sweet spot," but I only make suggestions.<br/><br/>Of suggestions and comments, I will be able to make more when I have more time to read the rules.  I've got some downtime from my regular group, so I may even get a chance to play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid" title="HiQKid"><img alt="HiQKid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid">HiQKid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209670/#Comment_209670" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-30T10:51:21+00:00" title="May 30, 2009 10:51AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2009 10:54AM by HiQKid.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read it fully, either, but I'd like to.<br/><br/>I can say that, on the gender issue... it seems the intent is to be all female.<br/>I say this based on page 29, which says: "By default, Raspberry Heaven characters are Japanese high school girls..." and "Having characters that are in another level of school, in school somewhere besides Japan, or are even (gasp!) boys instead of or in addition to girls isn\u2019t too hard." and "Should you decide to allow for male characters"...<br/><br/>That said, it's made pretty clear that changes and tweaks to the setting and game are allowed; perhaps even encouraged... but it's also plainly stated that the Quirks would need to be changed to be more appropriate.<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, and the 4-panel scrapbook idea? Awesome. Seriously, I want to play this game and do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209695/#Comment_209695" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-30T21:55:36+00:00" title="May 30, 2009  9:55PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for your interest. I'm not sure how I missed this thread. ^_^;<br/><br/>Yeah, the characters are meant to be all female, and that's something I'll definitely try to make clearer when I sit down to rewrite stuff. (Another friend I showed it to said the exact same thing in fact.) If you know the source material, the characters are mostly if not entirely female, so my litmus test for the selection of Quirks was whether you could recreate the main cast of Azumanga Daioh, Sunshine Sketch, Lucky Star, etc., and so far I've found it very easy to pick out three of the Quirks to represent any given character from those. I'm very curious to see what people might be able to do hacking it, but of course I'm sticking to my original concept as I develop the game.<br/><br/>I do like the scrapbook idea, and it's similar to something I was playing with for another game--a "Fan Guide" where the group would collectively compile an ongoing guide to the game world--though I need to think about it more. I tried the Fan Guide thing in an OVA campaign I ran, and after a while the players totally lost interest in it, so I think it would have to be more integrated into the regular gameplay in some way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregory" title="Gregory"><img alt="Gregory" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregory">Gregory</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209709/#Comment_209709" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-31T03:29:23+00:00" title="May 31, 2009  3:29AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, three things.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I've actually read through the rules completely. I like the mix of quirks, I like the playing card based system and I... uh, I'm trying really hard to get how the 4 koma based pacing works. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) I thought it good enough that I've already created a stable of four girls and some setting fluff. Then I ended up making three little 4 koma comics about them and their homeroom teacher. They're Catholic schoolgirls in a school mainly for Catholic Gaijin. Fun stuff. I want to do a game of this, but I have no idea where to recruit people for a play by post. Anyone know a good forum or something where this kind of thing could take off?<br/>\n<br/>\n3)The rules are general enough that I can see it being used for all sorts of things. I'm thinking that I want to make a Genshiken hack for this where the characters are otaku who have their own otaku club. I also want to see if it's possible to do a Sayanora, Zetsubou sensei type deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209710/#Comment_209710" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-31T05:56:18+00:00" title="May 31, 2009  5:56AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I need to do more playtesting, because I can't really think of any advice on how to do the pacing beyond "just feel it out". The idea is that whoever gets narration rights briefly fills in stuff as appropriate to the new phase, then everyone role-plays, then the tutor flips over the next card when he or she feels it's appropriate, usually after a few minutes. First you set up the situation, then you develop it some more, then you create some kind of "wrinkle", then you resolve it.<br/><br/>(And incidentally I'm working on another game, which I may stick in the back of the RH book, called "Dandelion Complex" that's inspired by Zetsubou-sensei and Pani Poni Dash, but is basically an excuse for inserting Maid RPG style random events into things.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209714/#Comment_209714" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-31T07:32:36+00:00" title="May 31, 2009  7:32AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like what you're doing with this game, Ewen.
