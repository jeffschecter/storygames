The combat should be an up close and personal <i>experience</i>, not some detached, boardgamey pawn-pushing.<br/><br/>So.  The question.<br/><br/>Is that experience more fun if you've looked at a map and figured out a plan, and now it's time to throw your brilliant and/or colorful solution at the menace and see what unfolds?<br/><br/>Or is it more fun when the GM says "and then something jumps you!" and forces a clock on you, rolling a monster attack every few seconds of real time (so you'd better choose fast if you want to take action!), and feeding you only the fleeting stimuli your character receives as his adrenaline spikes?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209506/#Comment_209506" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-29T02:45:28+00:00" title="May 29, 2009  2:45AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depends on the game?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209527/#Comment_209527" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-29T07:56:23+00:00" title="May 29, 2009  7:56AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            not even the game, <br/><br/>I've taking the two different approaches in the same game system, with the same players and in the same campaign/saga/continuing play. <br/><br/>It depends on your goals, my players seemed to have fun each time, althought very different fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209533/#Comment_209533" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-29T08:35:36+00:00" title="May 29, 2009  8:35AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what mostly makes it fun for me -- or rather, what doesn't get in the way of my fun -- is pacing.

Something about the idea of the GM holding information back in a combat scene was bugging me, but I couldn't put my finger on it: there's nothing obviously or inherently wrong with the idea, but in the back of my head I kept thinking "that's kind of a dick move, though."  Intellectually, I could grasp that it's a fine way to run a fight scene, I could even think of actual play examples where it worked great, but the sense that there was something annoying and wrong about it kept gnawing at me.<br/><br/>But I get it now.  The problem I have is not the GM holding information back or representing combat as a chaotic swirl of events requiring immediate decisions in the absence of perfect information, it's when I get the feeling that the PCs are the only ones in the fight who are being treated that way.  If I'm getting the sense that the GM is working against us, holding back information from our characters (so that they can be tricked or make poor tactical decisions) but freely using a perfect understanding of what's going on when determining what the NPC opponents are up to (i.e., they never fall for the PCs' tricks and always use the best tactics), <i>that</i> is what bugs me.  If the PCs and NPCs are both forced into making quick decisions with limited information, that's awesome and I can have fun with it; if it's only the PCs who wander within the fog of war, I have a problem with that and my fun is impaired.<br/><br/>I look back at the best "fog of war" combat scenes I've played in, and one thing that clearly sets them apart from the worst ones is that the NPCs were affected as much by it as the PCs were.  It really did feel like opponents actively working against each other, frantically groping for whatever momentary advantage they could find.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209581/#Comment_209581" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-29T11:55:52+00:00" title="May 29, 2009 11:55AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interestingly, the thing that makes combat fun is good flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've freeformed combat where the specific details of facing, relative positioning et al. are fairly vague, but it was fun because it was a good flow of description and counter-description. Things became un-fun when I'd have an IM pop up with "dude, that couldn't have happened, 'cause of x." The fiction has to stop for a moment, or even retrograde a bit, before it can continue. Contrast this from freeform combats where we're IMing constantly, clarifying, making sure things are okay, getting 'permission', etc, as well as combats where there was no IM conversation, and it was purely reacting to the fiction, and trusting your 'opponent'. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've also played combats with lots of systematic touchpoints, where we were constantly checking stats, making notes, etc, but we were doing it in such a fashion that the fictional combat continued moving forward. For me, at least, The Riddle of Steel was really good for that. A good duel, around the tabletop or online, was a joy to behold, and a tense nailbiter as the combatants maneuvered and counter-maneuvered for advantage and victory. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfT hits a good point, though... Combats where you feel the need to play it like a tactical wargame, rather than reacting "in-character" are less fun for me too. My Paladin should be trying to smite that evil monster and placing his body between oncoming doom and fallen comrades, even if it's not tactically sound.. But if the gnolls are all graduates of the "Gnoll War College" and never make mistakes, never fail to think like a tactician viewing the battle from above, it ruins the fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_209602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209602/#Comment_209602" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-29T14:43:38+00:00" title="May 29, 2009  2:43PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David; combat is generally THE most mistreated kind of conflict ever focused on in rpgs, so I heartily welcomes your question.<br/><br/>I watched tennis today, the French open. I like tennis. Not a good player myself, but to watch it is a nice form of non-engaging entertainment. :-)<br/><br/><b>Combat</b>, however, is better off being totally engulfing and tense, preferably chaotic and ugly. The consequences should be grim, provocative and often "unfair". Make the gameplay a driven and hard one, when combat ensues. Let the GM or the rules be as unforgiving as combat itself is. Hammer the players with situations (make a list beforehand), and resolve the situations with no regard to normal rules. Force players to make split decisions, and throw consequences at them at breakneck spead. And never linger, not until the combat is over. THEN you linger as hell, and feed the players like a devil, with overtures of reflection on what they saw and what they did, and how it connects to their moral self.<br/><br/>I've done it like this, and it is bloody effective.

In this game, and in a lot of stuff I run, the key for me is pacing. I go as fast as I and the players can go. I try to make it as chaotic as possible, and try to do the fog of war thing for both sides. We make all rolls in the open so every single time someone pulls the trigger, lives are on the line. I play the PCs enemies (the Germans) with two overall goals in mind - 1) take out the enemy before the enemy does the same to them, and 2) stay alive. This mirrors the PCs goals in these fights pretty closely, so things do seem to be pretty chaotic. I know how many men the bad guys have and where they are, and try my best not to unfairly use this against the PCs. In a way I treat the opposition as if it were another player with less than perfect information.<br/><br/>I keep the pressure on - the enemy keeps coming until they're victorious or too shot up to continue and break and run. Players don't get more than a five-count to state their actions, and do nothing if they dither.<br/><br/>This is what's working for us. The fast pace, the lack of perfect info, the cold numbers on the dice dictating life or death, it's all making this an exciting game for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209642/#Comment_209642" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-30T00:07:19+00:00" title="May 30, 2009 12:07AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>THEN you linger as hell, and feed the players like a devil, with overtures of reflection on what they saw and what they did, and how it connects to their moral self.</blockquote>\nWhat the hell?

If you want engaging and meaningful combat scenes in an old-fashioned Justice League International game or whatever, going for gritty, intense "close to real combat" is only going to <i>ruin everything.</i>  And it gets worse if you follow that up with "trauma-situations as realistic."  Horses for courses, m'dear boy.<br/><br/><br/>RPGs set in different genres may all share the same general goal -- in this case, making a combat scene fun, engaging, and meaningful -- but what it takes to get you there is bound to vary.

I think pacing's easier to maintain when there's body parts flying and nobody really knows what's going on - while a planned, tactical combat has more chance of slowing down into minutiae. I guess it depends on your group though, and where your own tastes fit in with the other players / GM. I think in practice most of the times that (as a player) we've had a solid plan it's gone wrong and descended into carnage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best example I can give of this is what you might call the breaking-and-entering RPG trope. Every time I've ever seen players plan to break into somewhere to get something, what happens is this: players spend 30-60 minutes coming up with a plan - PCs break in and start wandering around - about three rooms in everything goes wrong and shit starts flying everywhere, because they forgot something / somebody screwed up / etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_209649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209649/#Comment_209649" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-30T03:01:10+00:00" title="May 30, 2009  3:01AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>I believe that the point JDCorley was making was that "close to real combat" is NOT what you want when you're playing in certain genres, such as a Silver Age comic book game.</blockquote>Always a problem in debates on the net, this; people not sticking to the topic at hand.<br><br>David opened the thread with this:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I'm not talking about<i>any</i>combat.

What I tend to do, is to observe what kind of PCs is at hand, and help the players make their plans according to this.<br/><br/>If the characters are <b>experienced </b>in this kind of operation, I will help the players plan by asking question on how, who and with what confidence they expect this and that to be feasible. I will be their inner critic, helping them to revise and strengthen their plans. And then I give the characters some kind of leadership/planning-bonus, for as long as they stick to the overall plan.<br/><br/>I the characters are <b>novices</b>, I tend to rush them along in the planning, never helping them thinking it through, and often cutting in with an <i>"Ok, that is your plan, and now you act on it. You are entering the premises as planned, so tell me what each of you do, one by one, now!".</i> The typical effect is a total and hilarious chaos, from which the characters may or may not emerge victorious. If they emerge victorious it may possibly be with a false sense of how great their plan was. ;-)<br/><br/>I find such interactions to be highly entertaining, as a GM, and tend to see players enjoying the "realistic" feel of their characters when it is done this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209651/#Comment_209651" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-30T03:39:04+00:00" title="May 30, 2009  3:39AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2009 3:40AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>So let us be lojal to his intention, and discuss combat in that perspective.

I too have found that some attempts to achieve "well-informed" can produce sluggish pacing, and that a good GM can deliver an enjoyable, chaotic combat experience.<br/><br/>I've had some interesting experiences with the limits of these.  Example: I'm deeply invested in my character's POV.  I know I'm in danger, I'm carefully surveying what's ahead, hand on my sword.  As we creep down the tunnel, I'm asking the GM all sorts of questions, to get a sense of how easy it'll be to find cover, turn and run, etc.  Nice tension building.  But let's say I haven't asked all my questions yet, and then, boom!  The GM throws some monsters at me!  They're scary, moving fast, attacking viciously!  Yikes!<br/><br/>Now, if I'm playing some nerdy occult scholar in over his head, I can probably just provide colorful "freaking out" responses and let the GM manage the pace however he wants.  However, what if I'm playing an experienced, professional dungeon-delver?  What if I'm in that character's head, and prepared for disaster, with nerves of steel?  What if, as soon as the GM says, "It jumps at you!" I shout back, "I dive behind the boulder!"?  Because, see, in that circumstance, I need to know whether there's a boulder there or not.  And if I haven't found out <i>before</i> the fight, now I need to find out <i>during</i> the fight.<br/><br/>Thomas, your tailoring of suggestions and allowed response times in order to reflect character ability is a nice way to address this from the GM side.  But that's only half of the equation.  If I'm thinking in-character, sometimes the GM will give me all I need to work with, and sometimes he won't.  The process of completing that communication loop can make or break the pacing.<br/><br/>As a player, do I make some assumptions first, and then make a decision, and just double-check with the GM that the environment supports my decision?  Or do I make no assumptions, inform myself as fully as possible, and only then make a decision?<br/><br/>I wonder about the upside of formalizing a system for all that communication...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_209700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209700/#Comment_209700" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-31T00:45:54+00:00" title="May 31, 2009 12:45AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2009 12:46AM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Thomas, your tailoring of suggestions and allowed response times in order to reflect character ability is a nice way to address this from the GM side.

The way to meet the challenge of your example, is to have a rule that the player may introduce whatever element he chooses, and the GM must accept it, as long as it is normally part of the surroundings. That is: if you are in the woods, trees and branches and roots and such are abundant. A handy rock will be available. Use it! In an inn there will be benches and tables, and lamps. Use them! In a farm there will be tools and animals, and tidsbits of anything, Use it all!<br/><br/>to add to this: when you use such an element for the first time in a scene, the GM must not only <b>accept</b>; he must <b>approve </b>by giving you a small bonus for doing it. In my frpg <i>Fabula </i>the bonus will vary from +1 to +3 in a system with a single D20.<br/><br/>This may be extended into a working GM-stance; <b>Accept and Approve!</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_209706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209706/#Comment_209706" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-31T02:15:17+00:00" title="May 31, 2009  2:15AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2009 2:31AM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for the premises given; they leaves little else to work with, if you want to fulfill them, than <b>a realistic approach to character-interpretation</b>. I see that you may get <i>tension </i>and (to a certain degree) <i>drama </i>from almost any kind of fantastical fictional framework. And the <i>immersion </i>is dependant on the system, not the fiction. But little of the <i>"strong character-identification"</i> is to be found in an approach freed from real human behavior, and the <i>"close and personal experience"</i> really need some degree of realism to awaken. This is not to say that realism is better in any game, or for any player, but with this set of premises <i>a realistic character-work </i>will deliver you.<br/><br/>An effectively narrated realism can deliver players into a state where the "close and personal experience" will be strengthened by the proximity to life. This will give the experience a certain validity in real life. In other words: you may come to experience combat in ways that gives you a sense of what a real soldier meets in the field, or a sense of what YOU would experience if you were a real soldier.<br/><br/>When this happens, you transport your game from the realm of mere entertainment, and goes boldly (or frightfully) into the realm of ethical discourse of human relations and conditions, transported there by lifelike experiences. The possible contemplations arising in this "realm", will pertain to questions like "Who am I?" and "How do I express myself?" and "What is the meaning of life?"<br/><br/>In my view David is on the track of a gaming practice that invest role-playing games with a greater potential for life-changing qualities. I believe we will se more of those games in the future, a kind of games that will draw people more inclined to realism than adventure into gaming. These games will delve into historical, political and human conditions, with the goal of removing the veils of misunderstanding and ignorance.

I think the simple descriptions of the setting and vivid descriptions of the injuries suffered by all parties were very engaging.  The GM broke the 4th wall a bit by letting us know some of what the thugs were thinking, their determination and also surprise at the resistance they were facing.  After a few rounds, I was thinking, "Jesus, my guy might die in this fucking alley and I don't even know why!" That was pretty engaging, although there was absolutely no attempt made to make it immersive in the sense of limiting it to what the characters could see and know at the moment.  There wasn't a lot of tactics going on, other than choosing to concentrate on the boss and making all-out attacks on him in the hopes that the rest would run away if he went down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210078/#Comment_210078" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T15:04:08+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  3:04PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><br/>An effectively narrated realism can deliver players into a state where the "close and personal experience" will be strengthened by the proximity to life. This will give the experience a certain validity in real life. In other words: you may come to experience combat in ways that gives you a sense of what a real soldier meets in the field, or a sense of what YOU would experience if you were a real soldier.</blockquote>\nGreat (and scary) point.  I love emulating "real-life experience" in play because that's my favorite way to take in <i>most</i> of what my play covers.  Going to new places, meeting new people, seeing new things, forming plans?  I'll do all that looking out through my character's eyes if I can!  See, those are all things I <i>enjoy</i> in real life.  Combat, though?  That's different!<br/><br/>I have zero interest in trying to have a near-death experience when I hang out with my friends and roleplay.  Likewise, I have zero interest in experiencing the horror of gutting another sentient being out of desperation.  I like combat for dramatic purposes, but I need some emotional distance from the experience.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean I don't like detail!  Some degree of fear, panic, flying teeth, rupturing monster organs, etc., all seems to add to the fun!  In fact, wherever the line is of "too real an experience", I like to get as close to that line as possible without crossing it.  If an RPG combat can actually get my pulse pounding, awesome!  But if it clenches my guy and makes me ill, not awesome.  (Feel free to do that in your own game, Tomas!)<br/><br/>So where's the line?  I'm not sure.  My first guess is that "too real" is somewhat hard to achieve, requiring a combo of pacing, description, and emotionally taut situation.  Accordingly, avoiding "too real" might be accomplished by ditching any of those at the right moment.<br/><br/>Realistic pacing has not been a hallmark of my combats.  But sometimes that might be a good thing...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210081/#Comment_210081" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T15:14:34+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  3:14PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Danny, yeah, that's a powerful GM technique for sure!

Here are two that jump out at me, as two different ways to play through a combat while maximizing the feeling "that you are there"...<br/><br/>The first is the subjective human experience: do you want to feel your character's panic/fear, the frenzy of combat? Uncertain information, limited information, hard-ass pacing (like "you have 3 seconds to announce your action or he attacks"), etc, are good tools here. You want to be out of breath afterwards, with adrenaline pumping. The chaos of combat is here. I think that Tomas is describing this approach, along with many relevant and useful techniques. This can be really great and intense immersive game stuff. Really good if you want to emphasize the different nature of combat--how it feels different from every other waking moment.<br/><br/>The lack of control on behalf of the player lends some "verisimilitude", facilitating immersion--but also brings in a lot more control from the GM's side. More freeform description, less tactical challenge. After all, the GM decides how all that chaos falls out in the end.<br/><br/>The second type of "feeling like you're there" is the creation of <i>detailed fiction</i>. When things are meticulously, carefully, colourfully described. Rather than seeking to create a sense of combat in the player, you're looking to create together a robust and detailed image of what is happening. That does NOT have to be done at a breakneck pace. (Although I find the pace does need to be consistent for it work--a lull or an argument can ruin it.)<br/><br/>To do this, you need to bring in the five senses, the sound of dirt shifting under your boots, etc. You can do lots of cool slow-motion narration, describe the action in careful detail, "bullet-time", etc. You'll need more system support here, probably, or it can be frustrating for the players (whereas in the first variety, the lack of control is part of the experience).<br/><br/>It seems to me that these are two radically different aims, though both "immersion-facilitating", and require completely different techniques. Maybe your first step is to decide which of those you're more interested in?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210094/#Comment_210094" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T18:51:03+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  6:51PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2009 6:51PM by Eric.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading the posts of Paul, Tomas, and others, a question came to mind:<br/><br/>For those of you who strive for a "personal," "immersive," or "realistic" feel to combat, how much do you draw on memories of actual fights that you've been in?

I do not draw on my personal experiences as such, but may be said to use them as guidelines for understanding the nature of violence. and you may say that my personal experiences with it, as a youth, have made it harder for me to disregard the physical, mental and social effects of violence.<br/><br/>I do understand people who find realistic violence to be unpleasant, and shy away from it in games.

It's no secret that I favor the use of minis and table layout for games I like to run. Still, I tend to feel that the bulk of games that use that stuff rather move at a snail's pace and undercut the whole idea of snap decision-making and exploitation of events, and that kinda bugs me.<br/><br/>Or, to put it another way, while I like the artifact-use and am okay with a bit of the distancing that occurs with it, I'm not okay with the way most games seem to use the stuff seems (to me) to be a bad approach.<br/><br/>For an example of a game that uses artifacts ( at least for the ref) but is highly immersion friendly, I recommend you contact Elliot Wilen and ask him about a game called "Men Against Fire" by Paddy Griffith. It's an extremely lightweight WW2 infantry game, somewhere on the border of SG and minis game. It is decidely high chaos despite that. I played a game of it with Mike Montesa and Elliot almost a year ago ( or more) and it was very enlightening ( and tense and frustrating and a bit scary).<br/><br/>Even with the heavily modded version we played, it was still very chaotic and paranoia inducing, full of bad info and misperceptions and tough decision-making.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210209/#Comment_210209" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T12:36:47+00:00" title="June  3, 2009 12:36PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few fast bullets, as I think things have gone astray:<br/>* Verbal, verbal-plus-visual, and even computer-aided tactical overviews don't give you a fraction of the information that you get through real-world senses. Use of description, questions, and play aides clarify in minutes what one would ascertain in seconds.<br/>* That said, too much time to plan and react, once the fundamentals of the shifting situation are clear, does not jibe with the pacing--both rushed and panicked, and grimly enduring--of conflict.<br/>* The "fog of war" isn't always that foggy. Command and control lines can get broken and scattered, sure; but since the invention of formation fighting, until the invention of artillery and very-long-range arms, the average individual in a combined arms engagement knew where he was relative to his allies and his enemies.<br/>* The way you imagine experiencing conflict is not necessarily the way that a trained, veteran warrior experiences it--even down to time perception and filtering of clamoring information.<br/><br/>So we must ask ourselves:<br/>* Is the game meant to be some emotional exploration, where mechanical confusion is enforced through artificially limited information?<br/>* Or is the game meant to provide the experience of portraying a character that is competent to participate in tactical conflict that is nevertheless appropriately paced?<br/><br/>Compare and contrast:<br/>* A platoon in Vietnam, ambushed while on patrol: Most guys just out of basic, maybe a decent Sgt, probably a dumb-ass Lt, in the middle of a fucking jungle they barely know, attacked by natives = Emo, freak-out fest, away!
