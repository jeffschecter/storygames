I\u2019m going to a place that always seems just past our reach. It\u2019s a mixture of myth and hard, biting reality. This place, it smells like familiarity, and yet it beats the heart like first times do. It\u2019s wedged between a mix tape, a throw-away comment and a shifter. It\u2019s going to take a lot of open road to get to.<br/><br/>But open road\u2019s all we\u2019ve ever really got, anyways.</i><br/><br/><b>Ribbon Drive</b> is now available for regular order.<br/>Ribbon Drive is a game about road trips, mix tapes and letting go. It's designed to be played in a single session of about 3-5 hours.<br/>It is inspired by road trip movies like Wristcutters, Everything is Illuminated, Little Miss Sunshine and y tu Mama Tambien.<br/><br/>The game is hugely influenced by mix tapes that players bring to sessions of play. As such, Ribbon Drive is sold with a compilation CD featuring lots of cool artists and demonstrating the kind of themed mixes that the game works well with. It includes music from xox (which includes Jackson Tegu, who posts here), Ghost Mice, Darkest of the Hillside Thickets, You Say Party! We Say Die!, The Butcher's Bag (which includes Charlie Gilb, who posts here), Tuck, June Madrona, Maria in the Shower, Van Gogh's Severed Ear and Chris Clavin (formerly Captain Chaos; also a member of Ghost Mice). That's a mix of local and non-local, many of which you haven't heard before, all of which are really cool.<br/><br/>The book itself is 30 pages, beautifully laid out in full colour by Kevin Allen Jr, and it's packaged with the CD in a DVD-sized case.<br/><br/>Ben Lehman, author of Polaris and Bliss Stage, had this to say:\n<blockquote>"Ribbon Drive inverts the tradition of a soundtrack for a story. Instead, it creates a storytrack for music. Effortless innovative, intensely captivating, and a little bit profound. It's a brilliant game."</blockquote>\nMichael Peterson, who played a session at Gamestorm, said this in his AP:\n<blockquote>This was the best game I played in at the convention, which is high praise considering I played in an emotionally powerful game of Death\u2019s Door, cool games of Shock: and Lacuna, and a hilariously fun game of Sea Dracula.  However, this was the game where everything really came together story-wise.  Even typing it out about three weeks after the actual game, I still find it packs an emotional punch.  I also found the mechanics of the game to be nice and unobtrusive.  [...]  This is a fantastic, thematically strong, and very innovative game that more people should get a chance to play.</blockquote>\nI'd love to talk about the game more - ask me questions about how it works, how I designed it, anything!<br/><br/>An early spread:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://joepub.fileave.com/ribbon drive spread 2.JPG"/><br/><br/>And from later in the book:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://joepub.fileave.com/ribbon drive spread.JPG"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218604/#Comment_218604" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T18:41:15+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  6:41PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How well does this game handle purely instrumental tracks?

It's all about inspiration and creative constraint, rather than having the mechanics tell you what happens. More LARP/jeep/freeform than tabletop, but with the power of the tracks and your character's struggle driving you.

I've had a lot of really good scenes supported by instrumentals.<br/><br/>You can read the text about this in the first example spread, but when you start playing, you use the first two songs of one of the mixes as a catalyst for play - the first song informs us what the road trip will be; the second song informs us who's on the trip. So, if you have two instrumental tracks, you're going to have a diversity of interpretation. That's going to be challenging and helpful, in ways. It'll challenge you to come to a consensus about what a set of sounds <i>mean</i>, but it'll be helpful in that it's much free-er to interpretation than some songs with rich, complex and highly-personal lyrics.<br/><br/>Example: If the title track is "Sixteen, Maybe Less" by Iron &amp; Wine, you're going to be challenged to extrapolate from that very specific set of lyrics a fresh idea for a roadtrip that all 4 (say) of you can go on.<br/><br/>Example: If the title track is an eerie instrumental, you're going to be challenged to extrapolate from that wide open set of possibilities a specific situation. From there, though, the details have a lot of freedom.<br/><br/>So, in short: instrumentals affect the game. They work with it really well. Sometimes they might challenge your group to think together. This is a good kind of challenge, not a bad one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218630/#Comment_218630" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T22:10:05+00:00" title="July 15, 2009 10:10PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game is lovely and everyone should buy it.

To back up just slightly...<br/><br/>The game is dedicated to my friend Jackson Tegu. He helped me realize the vision of this game - by playing in the first three sessions, by offering to help write it, by talking with me about it. Originally, the plan was to keep Ribbon Drive something between me, him, Daniel, my other friends. I'd play it at conventions and in homes, but never sell it or "put it out there".<br/><br/>Others pushed me to reconsider. I was unexcited about the standard "120 page indie 6"x9" book with lovely art and uncluttered layout sold on IPR and written for the story games community audience" set-up, though, and started dreaming about ways to break that mould. Perhaps I could hand-produce the game in a zine-y fashion. Perhaps I could write it for non-gamers. Perhaps I could...<br/><br/>There were other decisions that emerged from that wanting-to-create-something-different itch (writing the text in first person plural, writing for new players, using photography and rich layout instead of illustrations, etc), but the biggest was that I decided to publish the game with a compilation CD. I wanted to celebrate my love of making mixes, give a neat template for people who are stuck on how 'tight' their mix themes should be, and to showcase cool artists that I like. I also just noticed that it reinforces that "we" pronoun I use in the text, because I'm actually submitting a mix, which is cool.<br/><br/>The first person I talked to was Jackson, while on a drive back from a convention. He wrote this song that destroys me - Towards Oblivion. It's about a road trip that's got this really desperate, last-chancers kind of feel, but it also feels really sacred and necessary. That's the first song on the CD, and sets the tone for the rest (and for any games of Ribbon Drive played using this CD).<br/><br/>I know one of the guys from Darkest of the Hillside Thickets (he's part of the Vancouver Gaming Guild), and they were enthusiastic about lending me two songs - "The Innsmouth Look" and "20 Minutes of Oxygen".<br/><br/>From there, the CD kind of fell into place. Slower than I had hoped, and with more anxiety about "will I be able to secure enough artists?"<br/>Jackson put me in touch with June Madrona (from his hometown) and You Say Party! We Say Die!<br/>I asked my LJ friends for suggestions, and someone put forward Ghost Mice - I contacted them.<br/>I saw Tuck play live and myspaced them the next day. Maria in the Shower is a local band I've been meaning to see live.<br/>I posted to S-G looking for artists, and heard back from Charlie Gilb (and a few others that didn't seem suitable to the theme of the mix).<br/><br/>I contacted all the artists, and asked them for permission to include their work on a commercial product.<br/>I made it clear that I couldn't pay them, but would talk about how awesome they are and send them a copy of the game.<br/><br/>Toward the end, Jackson sent me a second song, Windows Down. It took until my second listen to realize - OMG, he wrote this song about Ribbon Drive!<br/>So, that's a cool thing.<br/><br/>That's how I put the CD together.<br/>There were several artists that didn't get back to me that I had hoped would (Library Voices and Heathers especially), and several who got back to me but then never sent me the track (Hard Feelings). A few just said it wouldn't work out (Wintermitts said they wouldn't because there should be an exchange of money for IP - I said that I agreed in theory but couldn't make it work in practice).<br/><br/>I'm getting them printed at a print/media shop called The Printing House. The cd label is designed by Kevin Allen Jr and will be printed onto the CDs at TPH. I'm doing 200 there. If there's more demand in the future, I might just burn them at home and hand-scrawl my own labels onto them. Or I might do a second run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218822/#Comment_218822" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T14:41:32+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  2:41PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having not actually played the game yet (but very excited to) I won't speak to that.
