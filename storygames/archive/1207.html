                    In other discussions that I've participated in here and in person, and listened to elsewhere, I've become aware of a general class of issue that I'm finding it difficult to completely identify.<br/><br/>In broad strokes, I've noticed that certain games have a tendency to encourage play that is not a little wacky.  The result of which tends to be that neither characters nor shared world, or story are well explored or well served.  I tend to think of this as the "Oldest Game" problem, from the scene early in the run of <cite>The Sandman,</cite> but the same situation exists in the Wizard's Duel in <cite>The Sword in the Stone</cite> (certainly the Disney version, I don't recall the book well enough to say for certain whether it's there or not.)  In essence, both games are challenges of narrative ability; trying to defeat your opponent by storytelling.<br/><br/>Before I go off pissing on everything, let me bring up an counter-example or two.   Games that tend to keep things grounded, where characters and world and story do tend to work together.  My first example: <cite>Cyberpunk.</cite>   For all it's warts, dear old CP kept things well grounded.  Mostly by keeping narrative agency in the hands of the GM, and as an example it stands for pretty much all games of that kind.  As another example though, <cite>Dogs in the Vineyard</cite> does very well.  In <cite>Dogs,</cite> narrative power lives in everyone's hands.  Certainly the GM sets up the town, and that gives the story direction, but for the most part the game is run by the players after that.  <cite>Prime Time Adventures</cite> keeps well on track, as well.<br/><br/>Several story telling games that I've played had a decided tendency towards wackiness, regardless of the intended tone, and developed characters, PC or NPC, only shallowly, if at all.  Although it's not billed at all as an RPG, <cite>Once Upon A Time</cite> exhibits this behavior.  My experience with <cite>Capes</cite> and <cite>Polaris</cite> demonstrated this issue.  My intuition is that <cite>Donjon</cite> would as well, although I think it was written with wacky improv and disregard for character at heart.<br/><br/>I don't think I'm alone in this observation, and I don't think that any of the above are bad games, or broken, or anything.  But I do play role-playing games to enjoy them, and one of the things I like to get is an involvement in the story of the game.  And a lot of the time, I feel like there's a colossal amount of discipline required to keep these games on track.<br/><br/>The trouble with the Wizard's Duel/Oldest Game is that it doesn't work as an actual game.  You just can't narrate an opponent into a corner.  The greenest of narrators can skirt the line between getting what they want (a win, some dice, the girl) and popcorn.  But on the other hand, there is a lot of game to be had in narrative play, because even if there's no question about if another player can take your narration and get what they want out of it, there can be a lot of interest in how they get there.<br/><br/>One of my open questions is whether the issue is a matter of there being a GM.  Because there's a big difference between another player resisting your narration, and the Impartial Arbitrator saying "Come on guys."  I don't think that's necessarily so, especially given how little say the GM in <cite>Dogs</cite> and the Producer in <cite>PTA</cite> have.  I also hear that <cite>Full Light, Full Steam</cite> plays remarkably well GMless.  So while I think that having a GM helps guard against the problem, I don't think that a GM is the only solution, or that designing a game without a GM will necessarily lead to freewheeling, silly improv.<br/><br/>The other thought I have on the matter is that it's a question of comparing apples and oranges.  That narrative statements lead to mechanical benefits.  In <cite>Dogs that's not really so.  It comes down to an elegant dice game.  I compare my dice to yours, but I have to justify my dice with narration.  <br/><br/>So maybe I'm just coming at the Lumpley Principle another way.  That <cite>Once Upon a Time</cite> allows concepts into the SIS only by consensus, and a lot of the time, that results in wacky play.  <br/><br/>All of this, I think, sounds very musing, and that's because it is.  I haven't been able to hammer down in my own thoughts a decided statement to make here.  So I guess that's what I'm asking: can I get you guys to help me beat this idea into shape?</cite> </div>

                            I've noticed the same phenomenon in a lot of games.  Especially the first time a given group plays one of these games, the "story" tends to be wacky, unbalanced, and prone to the silly as the players really get a feel for what they're (a) able to do and (b) supposed to do.  For all that Tony talks about Capes being about competitive empathy - and I believe him -- the first game for me always ends up being wacky stunt after wacky stunt.  Then later the players sort of reign themselves in and "play serious" or something.<br/><br/>Here's a hypothesis I'll float out and see if it stays in the air: the games that you describe as "grounded" all have mechanics and procedures that reward players for staying close to some locus of play.  In <em>Cyberpunk</em>, it's all the chrome and gritty skills you put on your character sheet; in <em>Dogs</em>, it's the talking-&gt;physical-&gt;fighting-&gt;gunplay conflict resolution; in <em>PTA</em>, it's character issues and the pervasive influence of the "scenes should be about the plot or an issue" rule.  In <em>FLFS</em>, it's Thematic Batteries.  In all of these, there's a mechanic that specifically rewards players for sticking to what the game is "about."<br/><br/>By contrast, <em>Polaris</em> has no such mechanic -- the Cosmos map is nifty and all, but it never engages with the lumpley principle; it's there for inspiration only.  <em>Once Upon a Time</em> is even weaker, with incredibly generic cards the only thing that keeps you in a vaguely fantasy-ish vein.  <em>Capes</em> has exactly zero flagging outside of player interactions; as Tony portrays it, it's all about reading your fellow players to see what they're interested in and going there to reap the rewards in tokens.  So that's the "centering" mechanic, but it's something that requires a little experience before you see it clearly.<br/><br/>To test the hypothesis, we'd just need to see how <em>Polaris</em> plays with a house rule that all scenes must feature one or more items from the Cosmos, add some very specific cards to <em>OUaT</em> (very specific, like "Blood Magic" and "Corrupt Official" and "Old Gods" -- preferably in a theme), or add a couple lines on <em>Capes</em> characters outlining what's important to that player/character.                        </div>

                            Overwackiness is something I worried about when designing <a href="http://www.valentgames.com/donwload/ConsoleLegends.zip" rel="nofollow">Console Legends</a>, since it really permeates the games I've run of the previous Consoles. I think that the Visions mechanic might help that in the long run, since a group interested in wackiness will write wacky Visions, while one that writes serious Visions will either play more seriously or lose against the boss fights (admittedly, not the end of the game).<br/><br/>The fact that the game's cooperative rather than competitive probably helps too.<br/><br/>I need to playtest this so bad...                        </div>

                            One of the main things I look for in any rpg &amp; related entity is the generation of eccentric detail, and I'm probably the biggest introducer of themes that edge to wacky when we have played. <br/><br/>a few thoughts<br/><br/>* players discussing the tone of the game &amp; other player goals before starting helps<br/>* I agree that traditional Gmd games tend to focus more on role-playing and exploration; when the game frees you to invent &amp; narrate some of this drops in emphasis<br/>* in games with flags aimed at all players (like repetoire) there is a tendency to create unusual, memorable flags which can lead down the wacky path. Our FLFS playtest flags/thematic engines were more staid, possibly because the game text suggested more normal &amp; culturally-located traits.<br/>* it probably helps encourage deeper exploration of a few invented features (narrating a heirarchy of supporting detail) rather encouraging players to toss out lots and lots of new elements                        </div>

                            I've alluded to this in another topic, but Game Design differs from Government of Application.<br/>
<br/>
I've been working on a hypothesis around this general realm for the past few days.<br/>
<br/>
Designers have control over Mechanical Aspects and Seed Aspects of games, but do not control the Participant Aspects of the games.<br/>
Mechanical Aspects are purely system design and I've broken them up for my purposes.  Seed Aspects are setting/story elements that are intended for use by the game's designer(s), but have no mechanical mandate and thus may be ignored by the participants at a game level. Particpant Aspects are variables that the players bring to the table that will result in differing results depending on the grouping of participants.<br/>
<br/>
I've born witness to TSR's ancient Top Secret spy game being used for super heroic characters over two decades ago.  Clearly not the intent of the designers, but the participants used the mechanism to create something beyond the Seed Aspect of the game.  The Wizard Duel/Oldest Game aspects that appear in any number of games, could be centered around Particpant Priority Mechanics of the game.  Where does the lead lie with particpants?  Does game X or game Y have some sort of heirarchy built in among participants?  A game like Panty Explosion has no GM per se, but has a Superintendent that has clear priority among the participants.  Could integration of clear Participant Priority Mechanics add moderation to a degree of the wacky game syndrome?  It is human nature to test boundaries to see how far something can go.  My opinion, ultimately in forms of imaginative play this tends toward the silly in early stages of testing the limits.<br/>
<br/>
Once I've finished writing my ideas around the hypothesis I've mentioned, I'll post it to the forums for feedback.                        </div>

                            I agree with Thom, here: a lot of this is just about testing the limits.  Though it may be more likely to show up in, say, Capes, I've seen it in Dogs in the Vineyard, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and Amber DRPG.<br><br>I think a solution is to start with something like PTA's pitch session: by the end, the group should have a better idea of where the limits are (although it generally still takes some time and actual play before they're fully hashed out).                        </br></br></div>

                            Isn't this just about, to one degree or another, socialization?  If the text or the play group socializes players to the point that they understand what an appropriate contribution or escalation is (Ron's stakes thread is getting at this issue from another perspective), then you get play that is semi-consistent while not being totally predictable.<br><br>I was thinking about this recently in regards to games like Buffy and Serenity, where the rules don't do much to support play that feels like their respective TV shows, but 1) anyone playing the game is likely a big fan of the shows, and 2) the books are filled with text that tries to socialize you, making you realize what characters in the show do and don't do and what appropriate stories might look like.  Personally, I found Buffy to be EXTREMELY well written in this regard (hats off to C.J.).  This is a strong contrast to a lot of indie games that try to build such emulation into the rules of the game.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hands down yes, Jonathan.  One of the biggest and least-recognized differences between "indie" and "mainstream" is where they put their directions.  Mainstream games have loads of crypto-directions embedded in their setting chapters and flavor text, which work rather well for a lot of people.  On the indie side of the spectrum, this sort of stuff is often explicitly outlined in the rules and procedures, in part because there's a lot less subtlety in indie games (or if you prefer, it's far more straightforward) but also because, since the rules are often looser in terms of who gets to contribute to the story, the guidelines need to be more obvious and rigid.  When the GM-god is telling "his story" and the players are "playing along" they don't need the sort of robust directions provided by strong rules procedures.<br><br><em>Addendum:</em> it's the difference between making your game inspirational versus procedural.  Not that these are mutually exclusive, mind: just two paths up the mountain.                        </br></br></div>

                            Great thread, Judson.<br><br>I'm wrestling with this very issue as I develop "The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries," my pulp exploration storytelling game from Game Chef '06 (which you judged as I recall). While the game had conflict resolution mechanics, the original version simply relied on the players to freely narrate the connections between their conflicts so that a story emerged. Without a GM, the possibility existed for crazy results much like the ones you're describing. That was definitely the weakest part of the game.<br><br/>Since then, I've been working on creating mechanisms to encourage the players to organize their conflicts into a coherent story with recurring elements, mysteries later being revealed, etc. At the same time, I'm trying to ensure that all the mechanics evoke the pulp genre feel so that the players find themselves at least subliminally constrained from going for the wacky and inappropriate. Finally, I've put in veto mechanics at several levels that allow two other players that disagree with your narration or action to put on the brakes and reorient the game in a better direction. Will all this work? We'll see in playtest.<br/><br/>I'd like to think that a GMless game need not suffer from this problem any more than a game with a GM, but you're right that they do at this point. While I see many GMless games spending time discussing how the group needs to get on the same page before play begins, in practice I've seen many groups just dive right in without this discussion and end up with wacky play because of it. So maybe these games need to have that GM authority to guide (censor?) inappropriate content during play distributed among the players in some fashion. Even so, though, in many groups the existing social dynamics might prevent such distributed authority from actually being used.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            Of course you're right, Guy. Maybe what I'm grasping at is the reality that in many game groups only one person will have read a game and in presenting it to the others will obviously spend the most time on the mechanics and details of the rules. In such a case, nontraditional rules that don't show up in mainstream RPGs like the getting-on-the same-page discussion can get short shrift. Hence, one crazy first session. Maybe adding mechanisms to allow content to be vetoed or otherwise guided away from inappropriate wackiness during play could strengthen the pre-game discussion and reign in that first session. I'm thinking carrots like Fan Mail are better than sticks, but there's probably room for both.                        </div>

                            Yes, if a GM takes on the role of seriousness guy, then he can act as that focus. But I don't think that there's any reason a priori that the guy without the player character is neccessarily any better suited to this. That is, it's a matter of it being somebody's responsibility and them doing their responsibility. In Universalis, the problem with first games is that players don't understand that they have to take this role on. They have the opportunity to set up mechanical weight behind seriousness, and the book makes that point. You can say anything in the Tenet phase you want about how serious the game will be. But even once the mechanical weight is given, it still comes down to somebody noting the rising silliness, and using the established weight to slap it down. <br/><br/>You'd think that if somebody made a seriousness tenet, that they'd then try to enforce it. But not always. <br/><br/>Many games don't give you a mechanical option to enforce this sort of thing. In that case, you can still have serious games, but it's up to every one of the players to buy into it being serious, or socially browbeating the other players into being that way. You can guess with method I prefer. <br/><br/>Authority doesn't have to be central to control things. But it does have to exist, and be used by somebody. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

Whatever happened to System Matters, then?  My experience has been that the text doesn't socialize the players.  The playgroup might successfully socialize players, but how is that tangibly different from "my buddy can GM anything and make it good?"<br/><br/>Furthermore, how does that make <cite>Once Upon a Time</cite> different from sitting down and riffing out a story?  (I'm picking on <cite>OUaT</cite> here because I want to make my point without stepping on toes.)  Which is, to my mind, a trick question: I'm not convinced that <cite>OUaT</cite> is any different.  Granted, there's a socialized element that "hey, it's a game, so it's okay for grown-ups to be making up silly stories," without which I don't know how often you'd get 4 or 5 adults to participate.<br/><br/>The more I think about this, it's a corollary to Vincent's Standard Rant about Credibility, later formalized as the Lumpley Principle.  That this sort of wacky early play - and in my experience wacky later play - is the result of a system that doesn't give someone a means to withhold credibility in an acceptable way.<br/><br/>Which is, I think, all there is to it.  I wouldn't say that it's a symptom of brokenness, just a cause and effect relationship.  That the wackiness of initial play is in inverse relationship to the degree to which the game allows credibility to be withheld.                        </div>

                            Guy, if somebody plays <em>FLFS</em> except they ignore the rules and play in Feudal Japan, they aren't playing my game anymore and I quite frankly don't really care what happens at that point.  Have fun with the ninjas, guys.<br/><br/>Eric, my solution to that is to present the First Session, not as a touchy-feely discussion that maybe you should do to get in touch with your fellow players, but a procedural step that must be done to create the campaign.  Much like <em>PTA's</em> pitch session.  This actually addresses some of what Mike mentions -- if all the talk about what the game is about is procedurally embedded into what happens later in the game, it applies those "seriousness rules" without anybody <em>realizing</em> that they're enforcing them.  So if in the First Session everybody agrees that "Military Life" is a theme they want to explore, that goes in the hopper for the Situation Engineering procedure, and every couple situations they play through will deal with Military Life as a direct inspiration of the conflicts they address.                        </div>

<p>It's right there. If we choose to use the social structures that the system has provided us, then it matters crucially. It matters slightly less if we don't. System Matters never meant "System is the only thing that matters."</p>

                            Judson, the text socializes players, hands down.  When the players read the text, at least. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  But consider all the Exalted players out there -- their understanding of what is and is not acceptable or appropriate for an Exalted game is, I'd bet money on, far more influenced by the text than anything else.  Even when one player hasn't read the book, the rest of the group probably has, and the non-reader takes his cues from the readers.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean that System Doesn't Matter; it means that the text is an element of their common and assumed system.  Since system is just the procedures by which the group dispenses credibility (lumpley principle), a group referencing the text explicitly or implicitly makes the text part of that system.  In such a system, credibility is often withheld because there is no textual support for a proposed action or fictional element.  No space aliens in Exalted because it's not in the book.<br/><br/>One important point, though: withholding credibility is one way to go about this, sure, but it's sort of the brute-force way of doing things.  There's a step before group consensus uses system to apply credibility, and that's the individual player deciding what he's going to suggest.  If there are mechanics and procedures which either constrain or influence that decision, there's less need for the system to come crashing down on players' heads when they make an unacceptable suggestion.  So if the field is wide open, a player may make any suggestion and be subjected to the tender mercies of his fellow players; however, if the player's options are constrained (all scenes must deal with the character's issue) or influenced (I can charge my thematic battery if I do something about my character being a Rake), the suggestion that they make for approval of the rest of the group is more likely to already be in line with what is acceptable and less likely to require the rest of the group to withhold credibility and say no.                        </div>

                            I think that the socialization subject is missing the point, or rather missing forest for trees. All play is socialization. The text is part of that, insamuch as it becomes a written contract for play (which depends on the players and how much they agree to adhere to it, or modify it, etc). I think it's all part of an organic whole. <br/><br/>The only real question, to me, is how well an agreed to structure in play does in achieving your goals. If seriousness is a goal, then having rules to enforce it helps. Pretty straightforward, no?<br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            Mike, when I was using the word 'text' I was reponding to Judon, who was responding to my talk about mainstream games use of setting and flavor text material.  So most of that text-talk was talking about the setting chapter.  That sort of text is referenced as an authority in terms of this is plausible or that is not plausible.  In addition to all of that (a sorely underutilized tool in indie games), there are the actual procedures of play.  They're also described in the text, but at least to my eye, they function differently.  They aren't a laundry list of possible and not, plausible and no, inspirational of what you might do -- they are <em>how</em> you do the things that the setting-chapter stuff inspires you to do.  All I'm saying is that I'm all for using <em>both</em> setting-content and procedures to inspire and guide play, and I think both can be harnessed to empower all the players around the table.                        </div>

That's very much in line with what I'm thinking.  <br/><br/>Of course socialization is important to any game.  If we're talking about the Lumpley Principle here, that's based on the recognition first and foremost that an RPG is a conversation, and that all conversation is social.  But not all social activity (I want to say "socialization" but context makes that problematic) is role play.  Or a game.

I think there's a very fine line between a rules structure that constrain what players attempt to introduce into the SIS and one which allows players to withhold credibility from certain suggestions.  Actually strike that.  I'd say that there is <strong>no real difference</strong> between a rule that says "you can only enter this kind of statement into the fiction" and a rule that says "only this kind of statement is admissible into the fiction."  Essentially, both present a tool to me as a second player (or as the GM) to say "Nuh-uh!  That's not cool." (Read: "I am withholding credibility.")  Players quickly internalize that reality: that if in PTA they try to frame a scene that doesn't involve an issue, the other players will say "not in the rules" - or if they're stretching to far to charge their Rake battery, the Referee (or other players) will call them on it.<br/><br/>But if anything at all is fair game, and the rules don't provide criteria for fiction, then any resistance from your fellow players is pretty much a value judgment, of you personally, or of your creative efforts.  And you're essentially just riffing out a story, and I'm unclear then on what the designer has provided.<br/><br/>And as a matter of personal aesthetics, I want that kind of support from a game I intend to play.                        </div>

I think the difference to me comes from the source of authority on those edits.  Basically, I see two kinds:
<dl>
<dt>Table Consensus</dt>
<dd>What the players at the table think is cool.  I discard ideas without contributing them because I don't think they're worthwhile, or my group overrides my contribution because it isn't cool.  I think there are a lot of valid variations to this, including limits of squick, or aesthetic preferences.  But one way or another this is a value judgment that takes place at the table.  If we're playing together, consensus based edits are inherently between you and I.</dd>
<dt>Systemic Authority</dt>
<dd>Upon consideration of the rules, and our play contract, the contribution is invalid.  There's a value judgment again, but there isn't a direct judgment about me or my creative efforts, only about how well they fit the criteria of the system.  I discard suggestions unvoiced because I don't think they fit within the bounds of the rules, or would be too much of a stretch, or definitely over a social contract line.  You object to my contributions on the same grounds.</dd>
</dl>
Now, maybe this makes me less edgy, or to limited or whatever, but I have to know you really well to be comfortable expressing value judgments about you and your creative input.  I think I can accept it pretty well from most places, but if I'm given the tool of an objective criteria: "Is this within the rules?" then I don't have to concern myself with that level of value judgment.<br/><br/>But all that strikes me as orthogonal to the difference you're expressing.  I raise it because I know that I'm more prone to feel self-censorship when there are "weak" systemic constraints.  It's so easy to discard ideas that are outside a "strong" system I don't feel it, if that makes sense, and there's much more at stake if I inject an iffy idea with "weak" systemic tools available.                        </div>

                            From <a href="http://urdwell.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Thor's Blog</a><br/><br/>"We also began sketching out ideas for what Psychology (psychic powers akin to those described by Asimov in Second Foundation) would do, and how to translate that into mechanics. We spent a lot of time pouring over Shevaâ€™s War, looking at the dialogue between Vienne, Sheva and Philippe, searching for clues as to what Chrisâ€™ psychologists could and couldnâ€™t do. It was immediately clear that Psychology would be problematic. Psychologists have the ability to control minds. They can change Beliefs! How could we allow that sort of thing without turning Psychologist characters into generators of Social Contract dysfunction?<br/><br/>Luke had an answer: Connections. For most Psychology effects, a Psychologist would require a Connection. And we decided that our rules would not allow for a Connection to be forced upon a player. Instead, the Connection would be a player-to-player contract. A player of a psychologist could offer a Connection to any other character in the psychologist characterâ€™s presence. The player of the target character could accept or refuse, and that would be the end of the matter. Accepting the Connection would open the character up to a range of effects, both beneficial and deleterious. Most importantly, accepting the Connection would give the target character a FoRK die toward all social skills (including Persuasion, Oratory and Command) as long as the Connection was maintained.<br/><br/>We also created downsides to having too many Connections out as a psychologist: The more Connections you had, the lower your Barrier to incursion by other psychologists. To really give that teeth, we determined that a psychologist could not end a Connection on his own. He would have to request his Connection die back from the other player, who could then decide whether to give it back or keep it."                        </div>

                            Guy,<br/><br/>Agreed, the psychologist's connection die does seem to be very clever mechanically.  And certainly the design inspiration was about about social contract.<br/><br/>I see a relationship to what I'm talking about here: A player says "My psychologist makes you Believe that Imperials are evil!"  The effected player can respond: "No, because I'm not holding any of your connections dice."  <cite>Burning Wheel</cite> is full of tools for players to reject submissions to the SIS.  And actually, just as full of tools for players to assert their right to submit to the SIS.  Let It Ride is a really good example.  And of course, there's a GM to serve as a final arbiter.<br/><br/>Why is <cite>Dogs</cite> always such a good example?  I assert things in conjunction with pairs of dice, and the limits on what I can assert are pretty clearly laid out.  <br/><br/>I can object to an assertion that goes with a raise or a see because: 
<ol>
<li>It's ignorable (for a raise), or it doesn't address the raise (for a see)</li>
<li>It's not in line with the dice - raise: 5 - I shoot you seven times in the head!  At least at my table, that's a pretty big raise for such a small value.</li>
</ol>
Those tools keep <cite>Dogs</cite> on a pretty solid path, almost to the degree that the GM doesn't need to do much in the way of arbitration.  Which is probably why GMs experienced with other games don't feel like they're doing much at a <cite>Dogs</cite> table.                        </div>

<p>Read, uh, all of Chapter 3.  (Page 56 and 58, in particular)  You'll find that, provided that you're playing by the rules, the Cosmos is necessarily tracked to the important contents of the SIS.  The relationship between the two isn't what you're expecting to find, which is maybe why it passed you by.</p>
<p>Then read most of Chapters 4 and 5 (73-76, and 82-83).  You'll find that the presence or absence of Themes is directly related to the game's reward mechanic.  Themes being the piece that you want the Cosmos to be.  You will also find very strict escalation caps depending on the Protagonist's values.</p>
<p>I'm missing the complaints here.  Yes, a group of people <em>strongly committed to ruining their own fun</em> will not have a good time with the game.  The same is true of Dogs, Sorcerer, or any social activity.  I don't really see that as my problem.</p>
<p>In Dogs, I could easily use "I build a nuclear bomb" as a raise.  Or "I stop time, travel to China, study kung-fu for twelve years, and then come back and punch him in the face."  All that's stopping me are the glares of my fellow players.  Likewise in Polaris, or indeed in any game.  Is the issue simply that you feel the need for a GM to prevent such things?</p>

                            Ben, I'm not seeing it.  I see the events of the fiction affecting the Cosmos, sure -- the Cosmos sort of works as a tracking device for what's happening and what's important in the story.  What I don't see is the Cosmos affecting the fiction, which is what I was talking about in terms of "centering" mechanics.  There's the "advice" that if you're out of ideas, you can reference the Cosmos, but that's a far cry from stuff like "every scene must be about a character issue or advancing the plot."<br/><br/>Your Themes might function in this way, but not all the time, since Themes cover a lot of ground.  So while "Betrayal of the People" could be a theme that would center the game whenever the Heart or Mistaken invoked it, other themes to the tune of "Shiney Sword" aren't doing a lot for keeping the game in a certain vein -- it's doing other important stuff, just not that.<br/><br/>Now mind, I'm not at all saying that the game is broken.  I'm just saying that there's this thing that some games do and have rather strong mechanical and procedural means to do it, and Polaris isn't one of those games.  Polaris doesn't handle bleeding damage from gunshot wounds, either.                        </div>

Ben,<br/><br/>My experience was that a group of people who weren't incredibly disciplined about story structure had some really interesting "Oh ho!" moments with the conflict rituals, but ultimately didn't get much in the way of story or character out of <cite>Polaris.</cite> <br/><br/>In <cite>Dogs,</cite> the setting clearly doesn't include nukes.  It might include the ability to stop time, but I think you'd have to argue very hard for China.  As a result, you've got a clear case as any player to reject "I build a nuclear bomb" as a raise.  And if you were to say "I kick his ass with Kung Fu," you're adding something to a central story.  Dogs, if nothing else, provides really clear direction: get out there and judge until ye are judged!<br/><br/>If we can continue this conversation with <cite>Polaris</cite> as a point of reference, without that sounding like an attack on you or your work, I'd like that.  For clarity, I think this sort of open structure is a feature, and I'm trying to see how the system of a game leads to this feature.  It happens that I for one typically don't like this feature, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's a bad thing, or even unpopular.<br/><br/>I don't think that a GM is required to prevent this feature, but I do think that a GM will tend to prevent it's occurrence, because the glare of the GM is backed by the system.  On the other hand, I can't think of a system without a GM that empowers the players collectively enough to keep play focused.  I would say <cite>Repertoire</cite> in later incarnations, or <cite>Full Light, Full Steam,</cite> but even the second hand anecdotes I have about those games were sessions that included the designer - which I think tends to work very much like having a GM.<br/><br/>An example from our game of <cite>Polaris:</cite> Mark's character, over the course of three scenes or so, wound up bound to helping his comet-riding alien helper enter the Mistake to try to kill a bunch of demons.  We were quickly running out of import from Mark's story when we wrapped the session.  We weren't done, we just didn't have anywhere to go.  His character didn't relate to anyone else's at all.  We could have kept making stuff up, but I don't know that we had an idea about where in any story any of our characters were.  My character and Josh's were in pretty much the same place.                        </div>
