This means that, if the game fills up (and it does, because Fiasco is pretty popular) then I don't get to play.  Instead, I explain the rules and help orient everybody else and provide general advice.  Tell them what makes for a good PC relationship and what might be a problem.  During the game, I throw out suggestions and ask for clarifications and try to keep everybody on the same page.  A few times, the scene framer has even recruited me to play NPCs.  It's not a full-on GM, but it is similar in a lo of ways to being a GM with a light touch.  I don't frame scenes or resolve issues (as those are part of the game), but I help indirectly guide the experience of the people at the table.<br/><br/>(I've done that for a couple other GMless games, as well, though for other games the cap on number of players is less of an issue, usually.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420751/#Comment_420751" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-27T09:20:07+00:00" title="August 27, 2013  9:20AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting idea Nick, over on rpg.net where I also asked this question Komradebob talked about how the facilitator role could often be a sort of GM-light role (I'm paraphrasing here, not directly quoting) which struck me as probably true. I hadn't thought about a facilitator who wasn't simultaneously a player.<br/><br/>Of course, in trad rpgs a GM who is simultaneously a player tends to work (famously) badly. In these sorts of games though the issues which arise merging those roles in trad games don't really arise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420757/#Comment_420757" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-27T10:08:32+00:00" title="August 27, 2013 10:08AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco came to my mind as well.
