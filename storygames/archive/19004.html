A player will try to negotiate around the rules because there is something there that he or she wants, but it is in a grey area of the rules of the game. Most games try to cut this down as much as possible, but I thought it would be pretty neat to actually encourage the practice and codify it into the system itself.<br/><br/>One thing I wanted to do was to have a vague fortune cookie like "fate" that the characters had to fulfill in the game, but it would need to be unspecific enough in order to engage people to negotiate. Something to the effect of, "you will have a chance meeting that will alter your life" or "You will meet the love of your life". It provides a seed of a story, but has no details so it isn't railroady. Would it be better to just assign random fates (cards, dice, throwing darts at a wind chime, ect...) or to allow players to freely choose from a list or maybe make their own? (I liked the idea of baking them into cookies, personally, but most GMs I know are horrible bakers, and it is for the good of humanity that I avoid this as a rule.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424483/#Comment_424483" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T08:58:44+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  8:58AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not go with an auction system?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424484/#Comment_424484" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T09:02:42+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  9:02AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Archipelago </i>has players author them for one another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave" title="SteveDave"><img alt="SteveDave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/267/nLSFO0MJD2Z0T.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave">SteveDave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424489/#Comment_424489" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T09:43:01+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  9:43AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am aware of Archipelago (and what I am describing happens a lot every time I have played it or a derivative of it), I like it, but I am trying to do something else.

I want to encourage this player negotiation that naturally happens, and I just don't think that Archipelago is the best way to go with it.<br/><br/>Auctions only work if you have something to buy with, and then it becomes very locked down... true love costs 3 points, rivals cost 4, ect... I don't want to codify "fate" like that to avoid farming issues. I hate games where, "I have to kill 1,000 boars with my rusty shovel in order to buy a bow and to learn how to use it." I am also trying to stay away from votes because democracies tend to either form lines between players or force everyone to taking one person's lead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424490/#Comment_424490" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T09:54:35+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  9:54AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why would you necessarily have to lock it down? <br/><br/>As an example of something I don't think would be locked down and wouldn't be farmable at all (and I am entirely spitballing here so tell me if I'm crazy). Each player gets 10 beads (fate points or whatever). A random selection of fates equal to the number of players (or the number of players plus 1 if you want the option for one fate not to be taken) are available for bid between the characters. All beads spent go to the GM who can use them in play for some sort of mechanical advantage (like dark side points in EotE) or for a fiat moment (like awarding a hero point in M&amp;M). Unspent beads stay with the players who can use them to invoke a fate related benefit. If a player doesn't end up with a fate the GM gets to assign them one (possibly from a pool of dark fates?).<br/><br/>You could if you wanted add additional elements (advantages, resources, abilities, etc) to the economy to make it more complex...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave" title="SteveDave"><img alt="SteveDave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/267/nLSFO0MJD2Z0T.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave">SteveDave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424501/#Comment_424501" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T13:58:57+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  1:58PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in the middle of spitballing it, so all thoughts are welcome <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I am thinking it is necessary to lock it down to have something to negotiate. With you idea of buying fate with points (sounds a lot like Penny for Your Thought by the way) you are acting firmly within the rules to buy fate; nothing to question and the only fear you have is to be out bid by another player. <br/><br/>The part I wanted to encourage was that point in a game where a player realizes he doesn't have the Charisma to talk someone into doing something for them, so they try to see if anyone would object to them using intelligence to try to BS their way into convincing someone to do it. You need the rule in order to bend it, in my mind at least. <br/><br/>I wanted to see if it would be fun to do this with major plot points in a story based game, though. (seems like it would be to me at least) You either get a fate that says your character will fall in love, but you don't want to; you want to make a character that is torn between a love triangle. The maneuvering of the character into a situation that would satisfy your own personal agenda and the arbitrarily required one seems fun to me. Kind of a game within a game, and I have had a lot of fun doing this in other games but usually by accident.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424503/#Comment_424503" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T14:06:51+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  2:06PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This reminds me a bit of how Ben Robbins' <i>Kingdom</i> handles the Crossroads element. A Crossroads is an important, concrete decision that must be made eventually. During the course of the game, some players are given the power of Perspective: during each scene, they may pronounce a consequence of either side of the decision. (For instance, if the decision is "Does the Kingdom expel foreigners?", a Perspective player may decide that if "No" is chosen, a consequence will be "The security of the Kingdom is compromised.")<br/><br/>So the decision winds up accumulating implications for each side, which makes it a messy choice at the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424560/#Comment_424560" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T10:00:12+00:00" title="November 21, 2013 10:00AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not that it has 100% to do with this specific topic, but one thing I might point you to (if you weren't aware of it) is the Amber Diceless system's Auction.  It's used during character creation, and goes as follows:\n<blockquote>The Attribute Auction<br/>A character's ability scores are purchased during character creation in an auction; players get 100 character points, and bid on each attribute in turn. The character who bids the most for an attribute is "ranked" first and is considered superior to all other characters in that attribute. Unlike conventional auctions, bids are non-refundable; if one player bids 65 for psyche and another wins with a bid of 66, then the character with 66 is "superior" to the character with 65 even though there is only one bid difference. Instead, lower bidding characters are ranked in ascending order according to how much they have bid, the characters becoming progressively weaker in that attribute as they pay less for it. After the auction, players can secretly pay extra points to raise their ranks, but they can only pay to raise their scores to an existing rank. Further, a character with a bid-for rank is considered to have a slight advantage over character with a bought-up rank.<br/>The Auction simulates a 'history' of competition between the descendants of Oberon for player characters who have not had dozens of decades to get to know each other. Through the competitive Auction, characters may begin the game vying for standings. The auction serves to introduce some unpredictability into character creation without the need to resort to dice, cards, or other randomizing devices. A player may intend, for example, to create a character who is a strong, mighty warrior, but being "outplayed" in the auction may result in lower attribute scores than anticipated, therefore necessitating a change of character concept. Since a player cannot control another player's bids, and since all bids are non-refundable, the auction involves a considerable amount of strategizing and prioritization by players. A willingness to spend as many points as possible on an attribute may improve your chances of a high ranking, but too reckless a spending strategy could leave a player with few points to spend on powers and objects. In a hotly contested auction, such as for the important attribute of warfare, the most valuable skill is the ability to force one's opponents to back down. With two or more equally determined players, this can result in a "bidding war" where the attribute is driven up by increments to large sums. An alternative strategy is to try to cow other players into submission with a high opening bid. Most players bid low amounts between one and ten points in an initial bid in order to feel out the competition and to save points for other uses. A high enough opening bid could signal a player's determination to be first ranked in that attribute, thereby dissuading others from competing.</blockquote>\nfrom <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Diceless_Roleplaying_Game#Attributes" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
