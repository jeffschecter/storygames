I recently(not more than two weeks ago) read my first story-driven system: what else but, Dogs in the Vineyard. Reading the section on town creation. I realized the perfect (to my liking) way to make a game's story to be memorable, engaging and immersing. I'm also quite enthusiastic to use Fishing (aka: "The technique commonly employed by GMs in The Mountain Witch where you describe a part of something then ask a player to flesh it out") and already made my first attempt at it (in a little, improvised, epilogue of my last session [5 mins tops]) with some really interesting results.<br/><br/>Now, while I would love to go straight ahead and GM DitV I'm compelled to use nWoD for the next few sessions because:<br/><br/>1- My players a still a little skeptic and reluctant to try non-trad games<br/>2- There is a story arc hanging and we all want to see it get to a resolution<br/>3- I bought the freaking system and haven't gotten to use it yet.<br/><br/>This will be the first sessions I'll use nWoD (We were playing the game on D20 Modern but decided to change systems for reasons not really important to this topic) and I'm still convinced this system does make for a pretty decent story-gaming.</span><br/><br/><span style="color: orange;">The thing is:</span><br/><br/><span style="color: darkblue;">I want to make some little tweaks to the system (mWoD) based on the campaign. A modern world with strong, yet hidden to the public, psychic/psionic activity. The principle is that Man has reached a point in evolution in which adapting to the environment has become so unnecessary the next step humans are taking in evolution is shaping the environment and adapting it to their needs (via the mind, as well as technology, of course).<br/><br/>I'm thinking of changing the morality system in nWoD to be a little more adapted to a psychic heavy world, instead of a horror filled world. The change being in a "The more you see psychic abilities at work / the more your psychic abilities grow - The more you lose touch with reality (and thus develop derangements and stuff).</span><br/><br/><span style="color: orange;">The other thing is:</span><br/><br/><span style="color: darkblue;">I have some mixed feelings on how to prepare the session. On the one hand I have my method, which has served me quite well for years (the method being, planning the session in a three acts manner (intro - turning point - (1 to 4) obstacles- climax - turning point 2 - resolution - cliff hanger). But I've found I was planning a story that wan't necessarily as engaging to the player as I'd liked. I want to make it a little more DitVesque from now on. leaving lots of space for improvisation and character story development.<br/><br/>Fortunately enough I have two weeks to make this happen, for this week's sessions we agreed upon making a little more of a gameist one. An infiltration operation to rescue a imprisoned partner.<br/><br/>But after that the game becomes pretty much story-centric.<br/><br/>Any advice?... aside from making shorter posts? &gt;.&lt;&lt;/font&gt;<br/><br/><span style="color: red;">IMPORTANT: If unfamiliar to the 3 acts model and scrip-writing please read <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=199987" rel="nofollow">Post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a></a>.</span></span></span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez" title="Omar_Ramirez"><img alt="Omar_Ramirez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/370/nVR0Z4SVM1FWT.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez">Omar_Ramirez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199921/#Comment_199921" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T08:43:14+00:00" title="April  1, 2009  8:43AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: darkblue;">Some help, please? o_O</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199934/#Comment_199934" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T10:02:35+00:00" title="April  1, 2009 10:02AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Short Answer: to get the dogs type feel, you have to allow the players to come up with their own solutions both as the characters and as the players. Dogs does this by empowering the characters (they are the watchdogs of the tree of life, and god backs up their decisions, so no mr commoner your wrong, i shoot your ass) and by not judging the players (the gm should have no preachieved win condition). <br/><br/>To do this in your style, you essentially will need to do what you are already doing, just skip the turning point and climax phases. I'm not quite sure what your mean by turning point in relation to the 3 act model, but basically plan like this. <br/><br/><b>Intro</b> (Tell your players everything you want them to know) <br/>They Do stuff<br/><b>Obstacles </b>(Make real some of the stuff you told them in the intro) <br/>They do stuff, resolve obscales, solve intro<br/><b>Resolution</b> (or extro , tell your players how they did a good job (and yes I mean tell them good job, regardless of what they actually did or if it makes sense, or if you think little niggling details like reality would dictate other say GOOD JOB DAMMIT) <br/><b>Next Intro</b><br/><br/>its the same basic format, you just aren't planning for certain actions (or mini climax's per say) <br/><br/>WOD should work fine for you, you may want to make it less about using your mind to adapt things to your need (you said we didn't need to adapt anymore and then go on about how we are still adapting, BUT WITH OUR MINDS. It could be that in the absence of the need to adapt, the mind does strange things like spontanteously develop psychic powers or you could introduce a different kind of mind (think the psychic zombies from 'The Cell' by stephen king )or all kinds of cool things. <br/><br/>Hope this is what you were looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199969/#Comment_199969" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T12:25:55+00:00" title="April  1, 2009 12:25PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay...<br/><br/><strong>First,</strong> are you familiar yet with the concept often shortened to "You cannot sneak up on mode?"<br/><br/><strong>Second,</strong> are your <em>players</em> invested in playing your old games in new ways?

No matter how clever your mechanics are, no matter how innovative your set up, no matter what <em>you</em> do, you can't change why your players are showing up to play a game.  If they're showing up to celebrate their favorite source material and to have some low-stress camaraderie, there is nothing you can do to make them dig into deep characterization and profound narrative decisions.  That's not what they're there for, so that's not what they're going to do.  They may play at it to patronize or placate your wishes, but they won't buy in.  And buy-in is an essential component for any creative agenda.<br/><br/>Luckily, this doesn't sound like a problem for you due to your answer to (2).  However, you should be careful not to rely too much on mechanics and set up.  That's not what will make your gaming different.  What makes your gaming different is your players playing different.  The game can <em>support</em> the change, can even <em>guide</em> the change, but <em><strong>the game cannot create the change</strong></em>.<br/><br/>2) If all you are working against in brand loyalty (we play these games) and not habit loyalty (we play this way), then you'll probably be fine.  There's also a big thing in RPGs that is participating in a larger thing \u2014 World of Darkness has a lot of market share for this very reason.  Talk to JDCorley for tips on playing in that milleu. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>3) I'm going to just ask another question, here.  When you say you want to get more story out of your gaming, do you mean: (a) you want your gaming to look more like stories that you are familiar with in other media, or (b) you want everybody at the table to be making decisions that feed into the development of story, rather than the development of the immediate tactical situation?  It's possible that you want both, and it's possible (though difficult) to get both, but for right now, which one do you want more?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez" title="Omar_Ramirez"><img alt="Omar_Ramirez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/370/nVR0Z4SVM1FWT.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez">Omar_Ramirez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199987/#Comment_199987" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T13:53:41+00:00" title="April  1, 2009  1:53PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: purple;"><a href="/forums/profile/Logos7">@Logos7</a><br/><br/>Great post, really useful, thanks. Allow my to elaborate on my 3 acts method a little further (and for anybody not familiar with script-writing).<br/><br/>This I describe here is the traditional format of a screen-play in (the American model, that is...

Something gets in the way, other wise conflict and drama is lost. (The number of obstacles depends on the length of the script (or session, in this case).<br/><br/>Climax: Conflict reaches it greatest point. Tension goes the highest. (A heart attack / a battle with the big boss)<br/><br/>Turning point 2: A change in events that leads to discovery and the resolution of the story. (The assassin was the president's wife / The princes was hidden in the castle all along / The secret ingredient to the potion is love)<br/><br/>Resolution: Every plot and sub-plot in the story gets a cathartic completion. everything that was wrong goes right again. The status quo is re-established.<br/><br/>Cliff-hanger: a minor event that opens the story to further development and conflict (Jason's hand suddenly rises from the water)<br/></span><br/><span style="color: purple;">Sorry to anyone I might have confused n_n.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez" title="Omar_Ramirez"><img alt="Omar_Ramirez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/370/nVR0Z4SVM1FWT.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez">Omar_Ramirez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199990/#Comment_199990" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T13:57:56+00:00" title="April  1, 2009  1:57PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Josh">@Josh</a> Roby<br/><br/>definitely (b).<br/><br/>So far I've been getting lots of (a).

I am assuming, based on your OP, that you already have characters created.  Everything below follows from that assumption; if we need to back up to before characters, we can, no problem.<br/><br/>The tool that I think you will find the most use out of is Situation.  You can consider Situation as an alternative to the sort of Scripted Plot thing that you've outlined above.  In Dogs, the Situation is the Town.  If you are prepping a situation (going to drop the capitalization now) for a game, it is a little different than the scripted plot you've been used to.  The first (and hardest) step is to discard any idea that you know how it will end as the GM.  That means you do not know who the badguys are.  That means you do not know what the Big Climax is going to be.  That also means you don't know which sides the PCs will take, and it means that you don't know if the PCs will even be on the same side*.  Because you want everybody in on the story-building goodness, that means that you can't do all the story-building before play begins.  Instead of building the story, you build the situation.<br/><br/>A situation is basically a set of characters, agendas, and sets that are rife with conflict and designed to pull player characters into those conflicts.  Like I said before, in Dogs, the situation is the Town.  You might want to reread the sample towns real quick to see what I mean.  There's all sorts of stuff happening, or about to happen, or just happened, and (importantly) things aren't done happening yet.  And a good situation has all sorts of hooks to grab players and drag them into the stuff that is happening.<br/><br/>I just said hook, and I shouldn't have \u2014 lots of traditionalish games talk about "hooks" and they mean "a guy named Mister Johnson offers you money to go into a heavily fortified area and get something that's being guarded there."  And that's well and good and works for those purposes.  That's not what we're talking about here.  In building your situation, you want stuff that is engineered for specific players in your play group.  If somebody is playing a veteran of terrible firefights, then you put into your situation an NPC with PTSD who thinks he's going crazy.  If somebody is playing a woman struggling to make it in a man's world, you put into your situation a woman who has fought her way to the top and has just been raped by her superior.  If one of your players has fundamental issues with the War on Drugs, you put into your situation a drug dealer who's just been shot and needs medical attention.  Notice how it's not just the NPCs who are hooks, but also the conflicts that the NPCs are in.<br/><br/>If you are used to setting up scripted plots, at this point you are thinking: "Okay, and then this guy will lead the players to this other guy, who will point them at the third guy, and then the players will get to all the hooks that I've set up."  Stop.  You're pre-plotting, and that's going to kill the players' ability to make their own decisions and help build the story.  All you need to set up when you are building a situation is a group of NPCs in conflicts that will pull the players into things.  That's it.  You worry about how things get revealed in play, at the table, not beforehand.<br/><br/>A helpful tool here is a relationship map.  For my money, this is the best way to visualize a situation, and provides a good alternative to writing up a script \u2014 it lets you feel like you've actually created something.  Basically, on a white piece of paper, you write out all the NPC names in circles, and then connect those circles by their relationships and conflicts.  So if your PTSD guy is the brother of the female exec who got raped, you connect them with a line and label it siblings.  And of course the female exec is linked to her superior, and that line is labeled "superior / rape" or something similar.  Keep connecting characters with relationships and conflicts until everything is woven into the web by two or three connections.  Everybody should be connected to a conflict.  You will quickly find that, once everything is tied to everything else, it gets really hard to choose sides and say definitively that anybody is a good guy or a bad guy.  That's great \u2014 it means the <em>players</em> will decide who's the good guys and who's the bad guys, and they will do it at the table.<br/><br/>* The possibility of PCs on different sides of an issue can be one of the hardest things for players to grasp, accept, and eventually own.  "Party-based play" is often a HUGE bedrock assumption, and players can get really antsy when it's challenged.  I strongly recommend that you talk to the players as a group before you start playing with a situation instead of a scripted plot, highlighting that the player characters may end up at odds with each other and that's okay.  Emphasize that this means there will be scenes and sequences where some players basically sit out (and there are ways to sidestep this; see bobs and weaves, and players pitching in by playing NPCs, but that's a whole nother topic).  Explain that, at the end of the session, the player characters may be able to overcome their differences and proceed on to the rest of the game as a group, <em>and they may not,</em> and that's okay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200001/#Comment_200001" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T14:47:42+00:00" title="April  1, 2009  2:47PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2009 2:56PM by Josh Roby.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so you've got a situation, and it's on a pretty relationship map.  Stat up the characters, and you're ready to play.  You do not need to prep anything more.  At the table, you probably first want to remind the players that you will be playing a little differently, and that you will be presenting them with a situation, not running them through a script.  Tell them there will be a lot of characters involved in a lot of conflicts, and that you have not decided ahead of time who the goodguys are or how the conflicts should be resolved.  Tell them that that's what they're going to do in play.  They may know this already; it's never a bad idea to go over it briefly while everybody's sitting around the table staring at each other.  It reinforces what you're doing.<br/><br/>Once play begins, it will go in three rough segments.  In the first segment, your job is to reveal as much about the situation as you possibly can*.  (Dogs has similar advice, under "Reveal the Town" or something similar).  This sometimes means that you throw NPCs into running scenes.  If the PCs haven't met the rapist boss, maybe he needs to get thrown through a window into the bar they're in.  Yes, I mean that literally.  Figure out why somebody's throwing him through a window (maybe the raped woman's brother who is suffering from PTSD?).  It may seem heavy-handed in your head; the players will love it \u2014 as long as you are throwing problems at them, not throwing heavy-handed "hints" to solutions.  At some point, you will have revealed your entire situation to the players.  I strongly advise telling them when you hit that point.  Tell them "there are no more secrets, no more agendas, no more characters to reveal; you now know everything there is to know."  That ends the first stage.<br/><br/>The second stage is mostly concerned with the PCs taking action.  During this stage, it is your job to play all of your NPCs to the hilt, pushing their agendas and keeping their conflicts in the spotlight.  Have NPCs get in the PCs' way, and don't let them forget any of the conflicts you introduced in stage one.  Again, importantly, don't plan any of this ahead; you are now reacting to player actions, not running them through a predetermined sequence of scenes.  As you play through this stage, the conflicts will start getting tied up.  That's good.  You can sort of feel when a conflict is tapped out \u2014 there's a sort of finality to the player's actions, and they think they are done.  <em>Don't fight this.</em>  That's the sign that you are entering stage three.<br/><br/>Stage three has fewer die rolls (lots in stage two), because the in-your-face conflicts are petering out, and now the ends are getting tied up.  Stage three can be just as long as the others, but it can also be very, very short \u2014 like, ten or twenty minutes short.  Your job here is to show how the resolution of conflicts play out.  If the PCs shot the rapist-boss in the head and dangled him off a flagpole, you need to have a scene, even a short scene, where the fire department pulls him down and somebody in the company gets his job.<br/><br/>That, in a very big nutshell, is how you can build and use a situation instead of a scripted plot. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  Does that all make sense?  Any questions?<br/><br/>* Do not require die rolls for the players to get information.  This will kill situation-based play dead.  Since you are playing WoD, which has information-gathering as a focus, IIRC, shift the purpose of the rolls: make them roll to get information without the teller realizing what they've given away; make them roll to get information without pissing anybody off; make them roll to get information <em>and assistance</em>.  But whenever they fail, they should still get the information \u2014 plus complications that make life harder.  But since your job is to reveal the situation, not revealing the situation because they flubbed a roll is a failure on your part.  You should just be a fountain of new information, both in stage one and through the rest of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez" title="Omar_Ramirez"><img alt="Omar_Ramirez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/370/nVR0Z4SVM1FWT.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez">Omar_Ramirez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200058/#Comment_200058" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T00:05:55+00:00" title="April  2, 2009 12:05AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: darkblue;"><a href="/forums/profile/Josh">@Josh</a> Roby<br/><br/>Really interesting advice.
