It doesnt need to be too elaborate or complex. In fact, we thought about a simple premise of the adventures of a little clan in Dragon Pass striving for greatness and booze. <br/><br/>The most practical way for this that I could think of, is simply translating the default playbooks directly to Glorantha equivalents, more or less like this: <br/><br/>The Angel = Chalana Arroy Healer<br/>The Hardholder = Orlanth Clan Chief<br/>The Battlebabe = Vingan Fyrdwoman<br/>The Gunlugger = Humakt Weaponthane<br/>The Operator = Issaries Merchant<br/>The Brainer = Lhankor Mhy Lawspeaker<br/>The Skinner = Eurmal Skald<br/>etc.<br/><br/>What you think ? Any help is apreciated. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421435/#Comment_421435" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-12T14:22:22+00:00" title="September 12, 2013  2:22PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a thread about this on rpg.net... I think someone had done a bit of initial work.<br/>I'd think the various Conan hacks on barf forth would have some bits. Even Dungeon<br/>World may have something.<br/><br/>However the easiest way would probably be to start with John Harper's World of Dungeons and add stuff in as you need it. The Streets of Marienberg (sp?) hack of World of Dungeons would give some pointers on how.<br/><br/>OTOH Heroquest is also a viable option!
