                    My wife and I recently watched one of the HBO Wire pre-shows ("The Wire: Connected"), and I believe it was the screenwriter, David Simon, who said it (I paraphrase):
<blockquote> Â  We had to kill off [one of the characters]...  To do otherwise would have served character, rather than serving the story.</blockquote>
Wow.  Yeah.<br/><br/>It doesn't seem like exaggeration to claim that we've all played in games where a given player narrows their vision and presses for focus on and survival of their character to the (in my opinion) detriment of the whole story.  I mean, right?  I mean, I'm not sure what happens in any gaming group but but own, but this happens all the fucking time, doesn't it?  It's even sometimes considered GOOD, isn't it?<br/><br/>This behavior seems like a natural by-product of telling a player, "look, create a guy, and play him - he's your guy!"  Of course they're going to go all My Guy Syndrome on them.  Why wouldn't they?  1 player, 1 character.  As goes the one, so goes the other.  Very, very natural.<br/><br/>Contrast this with the sort of high-skill play that we hear about (and that I yearn to someday experience!) - among players with <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=660#Item_32" rel="nofollow">hardcore skills</a> who naturally (or consciously?) play games in that story-forward way.  I mean, I can totally imagine Jason M. or Judd saying, "Hell YES my guy dies|suffers|is set back -- that makes a rocking story!"  <br/><br/>But let's assume that we want (some) games to <b>foster</b> such skills, rather than rely on them existing in the first place.  If so, I'm very skeptical that it's even <i>possible</i> to create a story-serving + skill-fostering game while preserving 1 player, 1 character.  If you keep 1 player, 1 character, it seems like it's always going to be an effort to overcome the powerful urge to serve character at all costs.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>-JasonN                </div>

I think it's worth looking at the distinction between serving character and serving player. Killing off a character often does serve them, as it says something about what they're about. But it doesn't serve the player, as they are often kicked out of the fun loop by it (they have to create new character and integrate it with play, often by waiting til and appropriate juncture). So in many games you don't get incentivised to have that happen. <br/><br/>Now contrast with Mountain Witch, where even if your character dies you still have influence over play through trust. Suddenly death ain't so bad, since you can still do fun stuff and be an active participant. Take that one step further, make the player more powerful when their guy's out of play or not in a scene, and people will be much more likely to accept that situation. <br/><br/>The trick is rewarding the player when bad stuff happens for the character, and making that reward worth having.                        </div>

                            Hey, thanks for putting me in the hardcore camp; I am unworthy.  Seriously.  I love a good story as much as the next guy, but I'm also drawn toward stories of personal harship and miserable failure for some reason.  Everybody has their thing - we all know the guy who always plays the magic user, even in Twilight 2000.  Me looking for opportunities to revel in disaster is just reverse "my guy" in some ways, although it tends to make the overall story more fun rather than less.  New thread in 3 ... 2 ...<br/><br/>I agree that the way to foster story-oriented goal-setting isn't necessarily troupe-style play, but rather incentivizing the behavior you want to see.  The very notion of failure as something interesting is slightly radical in some corners.                        </div>

                            Matt I think has the right of it.  If the character is your only way of participating in the game then you will be reluctant to lose your character, or at the least won't be encouraged to put story first.<br/><br/>If you as a player still have a satisfying means of being involved, it becomes less of an issue.<br/><br/>So I think one player one character is a bit of a red herring, there are solutions in breaking that but really the problem is one character being your only interface.  Give people a way to play even when the character is dead or merely absent and then I think you will be much closer to a solution.                        </div>

                            Not that there's anything wrong with one player one character, or serving character over story.  It's a choice.  IF you are going to serve story over serving character, THEN you have to find ways to preserve the player's interest in the game without necessarily preserving the character.                        </div>

                            Also, I'm starting to sniff two interesting ideas bubbling up:<br/><br/>What happens to the player in a story-focused game?<br/><br/>What happens to the player in a game where the game calls for more character death?<br/><br/>Now, seriously? I know a lot of folks are all hardcore out there on all forums, all walks of life from ENworld over the The Pundit on killing off characters in D&amp;D and the like; Follow the rules, death happens, get over it and roll up a new character.<br/><br/>My personal experience with a LOT of D&amp;D (AD&amp;D 2e, some Palladium, etc) in high school and college is that GMs, players, are for the most part kinda afraid of character death. They will often not go All The Way. A major NPC shows up and heals people or helps them flee; the monsters suddenly "roll bad' (behind the screen), soften up, or retreat. Sure, it could just have been that all the people I played with were playing the game 'wrong', but for the most part I think that everyone sort of had this sort of deep-down belief that killing off characters, even 'fairly', was Bad unless the player clearly wanted to go that route in advance.<br/><br/>The medicine here would be to make character death less painful. I find the pain points are usually:<br/>1) Being out of the game as per above: Even if there's another character ready to go, usually you have to wait for a good "entry point'. But usually most GMs will find a way to force one quickly.<br/><br/>2) Character generation. We played a 5-session CONAN OGL game where the players, all rather tough dudes, ended up pretty much running from everyone. 3 snake men? Shit, they're gone. The reason was because combat was pretty slow and boring to begin with, and character generation took like 2-3 hours per character.<br/><br/>3) Attachment to character: The two above can be fixed "in the rules" (ie "give the next character an XP bonus or 2 extra ability score bonuses or something"). But Attachment to character can probably only be fixed through demonstration in the game text: Carefully crafting the book to make it assume that character death is natural, no big deal, a great opportunity to play another character, a great opportunity to add drama to the game, etc and provide solid examples to back it up. <br/><br/>No version of most games I've played really took the time to do this, so for most players and the GM, "Character Death" pretty much meant "GAME OVER" for that player (at least a little). And there was no reward for character death save, "it can be dramatic!", but that's pretty ephemeral in games which pride themselves on solid, tangible rewards for (tactical) player choices. <br/><br/>Definitely something to think about. What's the medicine for point 3 above? Dunno. Maybe some clunky reward rules. Maybe a complete rethinking and careful crafting of the rules text to get people over it.                        </div>

                            In Bushido, characters were essentially point built within a class structure.<br/><br/>A starting character did not get that many points, he was literally average for his class.<br/><br/>In play, you gained Honour, and if you died well that death in itself netted you tons of Honour.<br/><br/>When you came to create your new character, you could convert your Honour score into additional chargen points.<br/><br/>Thus, in genre play and accepting an in genre death netted concrete mechanical benefits for your next character.

                            I emphasize with the points raised about not wanting to hurt the <i>player</i>...<br/>
<br/>
But remember, I may want to kill off my character -- because my pleasure is the story, and the story would be better served by killing off my character. (Whenever I played CoC, I always tried to be mad or dead within the arc of the story -- not out of a "Boy, isn't this crazy fun!" sort of way, but because I found the premise -- "Should I keep pursuing something that's bad for me, but answers the questions I NEED to know" -- demanded that if I kept pursuing, there'd be a cost.)<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm going to go with Joshua's post on this one: Let's look at PtA.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be running the game tomorrow night. A thought bubble I had yesterday was this: "Think of this more like the British TV model -- shorter seasons, tight story arcs, and no obligation to keep characters around that the expense of story." (Really, that's what I thought.)<br/>
<br/>
"If you think you're character should die -- probably near the end, but even sooner -- don't freak. The character creation rules are very simple in PtA. You might decide you'd rather be playing an NPC we've made up, or have an idea for a whole new character. We'll develop it as a group, just like we did before."<br/>
<br/>
Remember, in PtA, play doesn't begin when the PCs are talking. Play begins when the imaginative act is in motion for the group. So, if someone decides to kill a character, then he'll only be doing it for more imaginative fun -- and the rules will support that.<br/>
<br/>
Christopher<br/>
<br/>
PS: I think it's interesting that some people on this thread are worried about death being inflicted ON the Player's character. I can't even imagine thinking that way anymore. It's a <i>point-of-view</i> about the relationship of Players, GM and characters -- but not the only one.<br/>

I'm just reading Pendagron and it's campaign book, thinking that it does a fabulous job on this. The campaign covers 80 years and aside from normal arthurian adventuring with knights, it also focuses on tending your holdings and building a family. And the advice is this: when your first knight dies, you take his firstborn son (or another relative, if there is none) as your next character. So, in effect, the game builds a family history, where sons take on where their fathers left, riding on his past deeds and also getting the burdens. There is some kind of reward mechanism for getting some of the father-characters Glory points, but that's more like a side effect.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt</cite>Now contrast with Mountain Witch, where even if your character dies you still have influence over play through trust. Suddenly death ain't so bad, since you can still do fun stuff and be an active participant. Take that one step further, make the player more powerful when their guy's out of play or not in a scene, and people will be much more likely to accept that situation.</blockquote>
I don't disagree, but I think these are two different kinds of play.  (1) I'm playing my character [and have a meaningful influence on play]!  (2) I am audience and am empowered to have a meaningful influence on play, too.  Players who have both avenues open are likely to be playing a fuller, richer game than those with only one.<br><br>Furthermore, character death and re-creation.  It's my experience that long-lived characters are somehow more special than shorter-lived ones.  This seems quite natural, right?  All things being equal, they tend to have more of a history, probably have more established relationships, and so forth.  (To say nothing of games where more experienced = more effective, but I'm not sure how many such games are 'story games'.)<br><br>And to Andy's question:
<blockquote> What happens to the player in a game where the game calls for more character death? </blockquote>
...In 1 player, 1 character designs, character death seems to often mean a bunch of work on the player whose character died.  This often isn't a bad thing, but it might be, if the effort of (1) creating the character and then (2) integrating them into an existing group (establishing all the relationships, and getting things humming) is LESS FUN than the play you experience once the character is created and integrated.<br><br>Also, my sense from playing more traditional games is that characters who are created after the initial group very often aren't ever as fun to play as the first characters.   At least, not for a long while.  Perhaps this is because longer-term games tend to fizzle in general, but I don't think so.  I think it has to do with the fact that the other players aren't sharing the same kind of experience at the same time.  Part of the people at the table are playing established characters, and so there's less of a sense of wiggle room.  My impression is that the burden to fit in is pressed much more fully on the new character's player than it's shared by the group.<br><br>-JasonN                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>I think it's really funny how interested this thread is in character death.</p>
<p>Characters frequently become lame and unfun long before their death.</p>

                            Character death seems like one of two things to me:<br><br>1) A holdover from wargaming that doesn't really belong, because having a character die is just a lot of unfun stuff for the whole game.<br>2) Something potentially cool and/or fitting, that was designed into the game to fulfill certain purposes.<br><br>And you can often figure out which it is by looking at what's supposed to happen AFTER a character dies.<br><br>Personally, being a crack-fiend for TSoY-style Keys or Dogs-style Fallout, I think it's much more interesting if you have processes in play that lead to character transformation and let the players decide for themselves whether that transformation involves death or not.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I think ultimately we need to remember that these games are played to serve neither the Characters nor the Story, but the PLAYERS. They exist for our enjoyment.<br><br/>If sacrificing the Characters on the altar of Story serves the wants and needs of the Players (and for a lot of us here, it seems to), that's the important thing. If not, flip it and have a ball.                        </br></div>
