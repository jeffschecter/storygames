For this to be funny and appropriately thievish, the name of the game should be super-short, probably one syllable. (Or would it be funnier if it was longer?)<br/><br/>What is the name of this game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment"

He is friends with Mikael, a punk Lead with photographic reflexes type powerz, he can watch someone do something and then immediately do it.  Adam is trying to catch "the disappearing girl of Santa Monica Pier" on film (this is Minerva, another Lead), and he is in love with Buffy, the sorority-house roommate of Abby, another Lead.<br/><br/>What I'm not sure about with Adam is what he's after in general. Like, is he a slimy film producer in the making, or is he a brutal monster to all who work with him a la Werner Herzog or is he just a dudebro trying to get into the porn industry through a side door, or what? I don't know anything about playing him or what I should be looking for in terms of Distinctions or Relationship/Value statements. So give me your ideas!

If he knows for sure any of the leads are mutants, perhaps he's bugging them to help him with a documentary called <i>Mutie Like Me</i> or something. They're not going to want to be outed, he's promising to blur their faces, whatever. <br/><br/>And maybe the reason for this is because he's truly on the fence about mutants and wants to know more. He's scared of people running around who can knock down mountains with eye boners but he feels everyone is just people and shouldn't be punished just for said eye-boners. Figuring he's can't be the only one that feels this way, he decides to make the documentary to help himself and his fellows.<br/><br/>This leaves him delightfully on the fence as far as mutantdom and possibly holding a lot of very closely guarded secrets should he ever fall toward the mutant hating end of the spectrum or he's poised to be a big proponent of mutant rights if he grows more positive.<br/><br/>So I'm seeing him being pretty focused on Duty and Truth but feeling like Power is in the hands of whomever is holding the camera (which is good or bad depending on who that is). He's pretty hopeless at Love because he spends  most of his time interacting with people via the lens.

Either he feels really strongly about it but it's liable to cause him problems (d4) or it's stronger but he hasn't made up his mind (so when he does, it's like a hammer coming down).<br/><br/>Any good?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325394/#Comment_325394" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T16:59:45+00:00" title="May 19, 2011  4:59PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea that maybe he's a lot more ambivalent about mutant rights than his friend Mikael (who COMPLETELY TRUSTS HIM, PERIOD) thinks he is.  That's a good secret. Maybe a short film gets made, and, oh shit, it's not that great for mutants. What's the deal, Adam?!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Next Feature is a little different.  Carol Cooper is described as a "military-style trainer". She's "the tough one" in the three part triumnverate of Real Grownup Mutants who are going to be the Xavier-equivalents of this team.  I have a good view of her personality and priorities, but I need to know what her power is and exactly how she got from point A to point B. I know she was in the military, perhaps even fighting against Magneto's Brotherhood, but once her mutation became exposed, she was quietly shuttled out under some thinly veiled Don't Ask Don't Tell analogue.  What's her power and what happened to her in the military? Did she know about her power and hide it or was this her first experience with it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325395/#Comment_325395" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T17:24:50+00:00" title="May 19, 2011  5:24PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And feel free to give me other versions of Adam, I will pick the one I like best.

Superhero shows are all up on the "your power makes your internal conflict external" thing, but I like the idea of the people just getting these powers at random, and people are left with an ability that doesn't suit them at all.<br/><br/>Like, maybe Carol's power isn't something that makes her great at fighting? Or does "the tough one" mean she's the fighter?<br/><br/>Empathy? She can feel what other people are feeling, and she uses that to be a great trainer?<br/>Precognition? She can see possible futures, up to five minutes ahead?<br/><br/>Or do you want some "big deal" power?<br/><br/>My favorite super power of all time is the dude from Powers who has super memory. They ask him about some obscure piece of graffiti, and he's like "Yes, I've seen that twice. Once was in this location at this time, and the other one was over there at this other specific time." It was cool!<br/><br/>I also like Nathan from "Misfits" and his <br/><br/>SPOILERS!<br/><br/>immortality. The dude is always getting killed, and then waking up a bit later. One time he blows his brains out live on TV.

He's going to come from a similar background, he's going to like a lot of the same things, he's going to have a similar sense of humor, similar values, etc.: if Mikael's a punk, then Adam's going to be someone who can mix well with punks.  More anarchic and freethinking and less autocratic and calculating, or more defiant/idealistic and less conformist/capitalist.  So first, I'd look at what Mikael cares about most -- if he's all about fighting The Man, then whatever Adam's goals are should at least include a little bit of fighting The Man, too.  There's room for them to disagree on the methods, but they should at least share some common ground.  You shouldn't be wondering "Why are you two friends, anyway?" every time the two of them appear in a scene: even if it's a total put-on by Adam, he has to at least present a convincing appearance of friendship.  (And if it IS a total put-on, you might want to get the player to buy in on that up front so you can both go heavy on the subtext and really enjoy the ensuing backstabbery.)<br/><br/>Then there's Adam's relationship to Minerva, which sounds at least partially antagonistic (people who disappear typically don't want to be caught).  Maybe Adam's going to be a wedge between Mikael and Minerva, with Mikael being totally "I trust you, man" but having to balance that against Minerva's desire to stay off-camera?  So again, looking at what Minerva cares about, it might be good to have Adam hold some opposing viewpoints, or to be undecided but leaning against whatever Minerva's values are.  That friction between Minerva and Adam is like a two-for-one special, Mikael <i>has</i> to have an opinion about it one way or the other, and boom, now Minerva and Mikael have issues they need to deal with.  Relationship drama all over the place.<br/><br/>Not knowing what the Leads care about, it's hard for me to come up with a solid concept for Adam.  But maybe there are so many mutants in Adam's life not because he's ambivalent about them, but because he's infatuated with them: they're an oppressed minority, they have a lot of visual flair (they bring their own special effects!), and they're very secretive, which makes them fascinating and exotic and worth filming.  Maybe he wants to be part of that scene, to document it and demystify it and make them (and him) celebrities?  Or maybe he's one of those guys who's convinced that the news doesn't report what's really happening, and that he'll get access to the real stories by tagging along with the X-Men?  Maybe he feels powerless (any kid who wants to shoot documentaries for a living probably does), and sees mutants as a resource that could help him accomplish significant social change?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325402/#Comment_325402" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T19:33:23+00:00" title="May 19, 2011  7:33PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Or does "the tough one" mean she's the fighter?</blockquote>\nNot necessarily, but she is the only one with a military background, so she does know how to clear a building, fire a gun, punch a dude, goldbrick and not volunteer for things, etc.<br/><br/>I like your thinking, can you tie in one of those power ideas to some way she might be "outted" during an Army operation, leading to her getting kicked out?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325408/#Comment_325408" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T20:59:41+00:00" title="May 19, 2011  8:59PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if it were a TV show, she'd be put in a position where the only way to ensure the success of the mission is to reveal her powers.<br/><br/>"He's an enemy spy!

There's an advantage to playing to the stereotype early and often, especially at the start of a game when you want everyone to get up to speed quickly: being able to say that Carol is a military woman whose personality and powers are in total alignment with that means everyone will have a very clear picture of who she is and how their characters feel about her.  They'll get to have fun showing how they react to military discipline, and they'll have expectations and assumptions about Carol that they can act on.<br/><br/>Then later on in the game, you can show how she deviates from the stereotype, and it will seem like a huge revelation; now they've got a history of being wrong about her, and they get to react to <i>that</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325422/#Comment_325422" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T22:44:10+00:00" title="May 19, 2011 10:44PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree...hey, did she know she was a mutant before that moment, i.e. she was hiding it from her superiors/comrades-in-arms, or did she not know?

Next Feature!<br/><br/>Leslie Thornton is characterized by the players as the "let's all get along" member of the triad.  He's a guidance counselor type.  I don't know anything about him! I think he's probably a mutant, but maybe not?  The third member of the triad, the "shady/evil" one, is Emma Frost, so maybe he's the non-mutant one?  I kinda see him as a little bit wimpy, but maybe that's stereotypical?  <br/><br/>He thinks of garage rocker Lead Ash as his pet project and thinks he completely understands little-rich-delinquent Mikael (Mikael thinks he's an idiot who doesn't know anything.)  This makes me think that he's really concerned more about mutants "on the edge" of falling into criminal gangs, who will no doubt soon forget their prejudice to use them to make a shitload of money, or into the hands of the Brotherhood or unscrupulous people like Emma. But I don't know what he has to offer instead? Or why he takes this approach, hitting the hardest ones head on?

Because he's seen the worst of it first-hand: his brother had an X-gene, and was strung up by a mob for it.  Carol and Emma, they see anti-mutant prejudice and think about how to resist it: all Leslie thinks about is dead children swinging from lampposts.<br/><br/>Mutants who are on the edge of slipping into crime or terrorism or who just plain don't get why it's so important that mutants not be merely tolerated but truly accepted -- those are the ones he most wants to get to, before they slip into a life that leads inexorably to anti-mutant riots and innocents getting caught in the crossfire.  If Carol's teaching the kids how to defend themselves and Emma's teaching them whatever it is that Emma teaches them, Leslie's the one who wants them to learn <i>context</i> and to see the bigger picture.  For him, it's all about doing the right thing at the right time to promote peace and acceptance and prevent bloodshed and prejudice.<br/><br/>And don't fool yourself, he may come off as a touchy-feely peace-and-love milquetoast, but the man is a fucking iron-willed powerhouse.  He's got friends and informants keeping tabs on things all over the world, and he's a planner.  Even Emma can't keep track of all the balls he's got up in the air, although she'll probably pretend she does.  Leslie understands psychology, history, politics, and can read data and interpret polls like a pro.<br/><br/>Basically, he's who Professor X <i>wanted</i> to be, if he hadn't been wrapped up in his own penny-ante telepathic bullshit all day.  This team is his idea, and if it works out it'll be the fulcrum upon which he's going to put a very long lever and move the whole damn world.<br/><br/>If he's a mutant (I could see going either way on that), I'd give him an offbeat power that isn't covered by any of the Leads.  Technopathy or Teleportation or Duplication or one of the Control powers, maybe; something that he won't use casually, but keeps up his sleeve for an emergency or as a hidden resource.  Oh, and something to block Telepathy, no matter what (Gear or an Ability), to explain why he can disagree with Emma without being made into a sock puppet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh_Unruh" title="Josh_Unruh"><img alt="Josh_Unruh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh_Unruh">Josh_Unruh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325523/#Comment_325523" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-20T12:45:09+00:00" title="May 20, 2011 12:45PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: Carol<br/>Just because my brain works in mysterious ways, if she's the combat oriented trainer maybe she's the anti-Wolverine. Rather than press ganged into service and mind wiped repeatedly to make her insane, she was the gung-ho person who wanted to go military but her mutant brain puts out a low level field that makes everyone fail to notice her. She simply couldn't be noticed and so was not only constantly passed over for promotion, most of her superiors were surprised to find her there at all since they couldn't remember her a few minutes after speaking to her. Eventually she comes to the notice of either military intelligence or Homeland or CIA or whomever and goes to work for them. They know she's a mutant, she knows she's a mutant, but when she gets burned on a job they just disavow her and move on (perhaps this was partially motivated by a mutant-hating superior or mutant-hating senator on the intelligence committee).<br/><br/>She uses her power to walk out of detention eventually and goes home, but never bothers to check in. Now she's rogue and not sure if anybody from her old life even remembers her. Plus, she's got all this training and wants to show young mutants how not to be used by the existing system, but maybe she's also got some pacifist tendencies now. Not like she won't defend herself, but she's become a "violence is the last option" kind of lady (maybe she used to be a lot more violent because she could shoot ten people on a crowded street and walk away; now she's trying to teach young mutants that the ability to do something isn't the same as the right or the need to do it). So as the anti-Wolverine, she's the slightly pacifist mind wiper rather than the murderous mind wiped. She's also totally a team player.

Maybe Buffy/Watcher has a sort of "narrator voice" power where narrating something causes it to come true. For example, say there's a situation in the game and Buffy character invokes the narrator power and is like "And then THIS happened", like the Watcher is relating the story.

The Army goes on high alert, and tensions in the ranks explode as mutants are singled out by other soldiers.<br/><br/>* Taliban-backed insurgents take this opportunity, when things are in disarray, to attack.  In their attack, they free a mutant from a local temporary detention center. He was mistreated by the town the PCs are protecting and comes back for personal revenge.<br/><br/>* Isolated and cut off from support, they have to get civilians out of the valley in order to get them to a hospital (and also call for help), under attack from IEDs and rockets.<br/><br/>It's relatively short, and emphasizes my mission-based/leader-based hack for Smallville rather than Wedges, but there are enough tensions over the mutant issue (and the fact that one just tried to assassinate the President) that there should be a bit of back and forth too.<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>"We're Airborne, we're SUPPOSED to be surrounded!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331699/#Comment_331699" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T11:28:00+00:00" title="June 26, 2011 11:28AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, PS I didn't put the Value/Relationship amounts/statements in because I want to train the players that those are written in PENCIL.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332832/#Comment_332832" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T20:36:42+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  8:36PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2011 8:36PM by Cneph.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This does sound immensely cool and I am very jealous.

Or some third option. What do you all think?<br/><br/>* I haven't decided about how he feels about being a ghost or what, if anything, might be done about it. (Emma Frost told Ash, "Any half-competent telepath could pull his untethered mind apart and obliterate it with a single mental blast, immediate annihilation. Would you like me to do that?"

Because he had a plan, you see, to rig things so that Mephisto or whoever couldn't collect a damn thing once the band went big.<br/><br/>Except he died before he could get to that part of the plan, and now he's trapped in the afterlife by regret, trying desperately to find a way to get 'em (the violinist? the PC? the whole band?) off the hook.  If they become a breakout hit before he can fix his mistake, he goes to Hell (and knows that everyone else will be following him there), so he has to haunt them to slow them down and buy himself some time, until he can work out a plan B that'll scratch the deal.  Hopefully he can keep his untethered mind together long enough to do that, or else....duhn duhn duhn!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337328/#Comment_337328" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T14:31:37+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  2:31PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2011 2:31PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hadn't thought of him as much of a planner, hmmm.  <br/><br/>Maybe he promised the PC's soul  because "mutants don't have souls", as the preacher on the radio said.<br/><br/>That might be a little too dark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337337/#Comment_337337" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T15:13:28+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  3:13PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2011 3:19PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you need something more prosaic, then drop the Hell angle (if we've learned anything from the comics, it's that X-Men + Mephisto = DUMB) and make Earl's deal with some antagonist you were already planning on introducing eventually.  Earl cut a deal with them, planning some kind of Fiasco-esque screwjob that would really only profit himself, but died before he could pull it off and/or fuck things up even worse.  Now he's haunting the band because he feels guilty about leaving them on the hook for what he did, but has absolutely no clue how to fix it.<br/><br/>The band's going to have to figure out what Earl promised, who he promised it to, and how they're going to get out of this mess.  And Earl?  He's not going to be able to move on unless he can earn their forgiveness for what he did to them.<br/><br/>I figure this angle lets you make Earl's story something that the band <i>has</i> to care about: they can't just shrug and say, "Fuck Earl, he's dead, it ain't our problem."  And then you can use Earl as either an ally or an antagonist depending on what the scene actually needs.  (Earl's not a planner, but he is a schemer; if he can eke out something for himself out of this mess, he will.  Or Earl's really trying to help, but he's so confused and so bad at planning that he's just making things worse.  Or he's doing his best to protect and care for the people he now realizes were the closest thing he ever had to a family.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14096/smallville-so-heres-what-you-missed-last-week-on-the-x-men" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14096/smallville-so-heres-what-you-missed-last-week-on-the-x-men" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14096/smallville-so-heres-what-you-missed-last-week-on-the-x-men/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14096%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14096%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
