It is surrounded by hundreds of tiny little planets, each containing a unique culture. People on these worlds write letters to the temple asking for help with their problems. Players take on the roles of monks from the temple who, letters in-hand, fly to each of these worlds on a pilgrimage helping as best they can.</blockquote>\nI put out a call for letters a few months ago, figuring the best way to get a variety of voices in the letters was to actually have several creative people write them! Unsurprisingly, you all provided some really awesome letters, some of which can be read <a href="http://www.danielsolis.com/do/letters.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Alas, I often hear from letter-writers who have cool ideas, but have no time to actually write them out fully. Well, I still wanna hear 'em!<br/><br/>I'd like to gather up all the little ideas that you don't think you'll get a chance to develop into full letters. All I need is a brief synopsis of a fantastical problem for which someone would write to temple for help. For example:\n<ul><li>A god of war is hopelessly in love with the goddess of beauty, so he needs the pilgrims to play Cyrano.</li>\n<li>The temple gets a letter from a bill-collector, requesting repayment for damages caused a previous group of pilgrims. </li>\n<li>A dwindling tribe of nomadic dinosaurs is being hunted by a comet that destroys every world they live on. It's Battlestar Galactica meets Land of the Lost!</li></ul>\nSee, it's easy-peasy. Just post your idea and I'll do my best to develop it into a full letter. You'll of course get credit when Do is finally published next year. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104132/#Comment_104132" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T08:08:31+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  8:08AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A child wants his father--who appears to have left the family--back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104148/#Comment_104148" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T09:44:56+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  9:44AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel,<br/>\n<br/>\nExcellent.

Surely, if a world has a problem, their first thought is going to be to send for the monk that's actually from their world, assuming that a native monk will better understand the local conditions.  It would be pretty cool to see how a monk reacts to problems on their homeworld too, since they are more invested in the place and things suddenly become more personal.
