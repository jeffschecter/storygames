Set up the grid (quickly: This alone can easily take one hour. Try to do it in 30-40 minutes), and together as a group make:<br/><br/>2 "Antagonist"-"Protagonist" pairs<br/><br/>Then play out two scenes with these pairs (give one pair to each player).  The first scene will be "the first or second scene in the game/campaign". Just to show how it works.<br/><br/>Then, speculate quickly about the things that may happen in the next few hours.  Then run the second scene with the second antag-protag pair, which takes place "a few hours of game-time in".<br/><br/>That will probably be a suitable demo that runs in a tight, furious one hour.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60987/#Comment_60987" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T09:10:12+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  9:10AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2007 9:10AM by Graham.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>That's like, "I'm gonna have sex in 80 seconds, guys.

I worry that the vast majority of what gets done when working the grid is <i>destructive pre-play</i>.  You sit and think "Oh, what kinds of scenes might we play, when we eventually get around to playing ... oh, but what if, instead of 'Gender oppression' we had 'Race Relations'?  And then we'd have to change this 'Artificial Placentas' shock ..."<br/><br/>For my money, if you want to do it quickly, ask people for great big raging hot-button issues, and then whatever they offer take it without question, then ask them for awesome, scary technologies that hit those hot-buttons, and move forward.  Don't try to get <i>the perfect grid</i>, just get one that's thrumming with spectacle.<br/><br/>My two cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61053/#Comment_61053" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T12:37:02+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 12:37PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony's right.<br/><br/>Based on my past experiences (the good ones) with Shock:, I think 3-4 players can easily play it out in an hour.<br/>Here's how:<br/><br/>First, get a keyword for your setting. "Cyberpunk", "alternate history" and "slave world" are all legitimate options. Toss out those three as suggestions, then ask people to make a suggestion. If only one or two people suggest something, pick one of their suggestions up and okay it with the group. "Does some cyberpunk work for everyone?" If there is hesitation, let them know that we'll collaboratively influence the setting, we just want a very loose concept first.<br/><br/>Then, explain Issues and Shocks. Explain what they are, but not how they intersect or how the grid works.<br/><br/>Put the grid on the table, point to the first player, and say "Name an Issue!" Write it, without discussion, and ask the next player for a Shock. If any player is stuck, either:<br/>a.) ask them for a Shock instead of an Issue, or vice versa. Whichever category they fill, have the next player in line fill the opposite category.<br/>b.) Toss out a suggestion. "What about Issue: slavery or Issue: colonialism, considering our setting?"<br/><br/>If someone's really stuck, skip them for the moment.<br/><br/>Once the grid is done, give the first player a chance to stake an intersection as the basis of that player's character. Explain as you slide teh grid to this player that their protagonist is rooted in that Shock and Issue. When he/she marks a square, slide the grid to the next player, ask them to do the same.<br/><br/>Let them finish this step before moving on. Multitasking here will result in things bogging down.<br/>Now, you're going to need the axis (or whatever tehy are called).<br/>Here's my suggestion: write one of the binaries yourself, as an example. Get teh players to collectively decide the other. Seriously, you've only got an hour to play.<br/><br/>Pass out character sheets to everyone, and as people stake squares explain Traits. Once people ask a few questions about their parameters (they will), and  bounce a few suggestions, and write a few of them down... move onto Links.<br/><br/>Then get them to write the axis and explain how assigning values works.<br/><br/>This (world building, shocks/issues, chargen) should take 20-25 minutes.<br/><br/>Antagonist creation should take 10, tops. Be assertive if people are stuck. Feel free to ask "Tom, who're you creating an antag for? Oh, Jill. Jill, what's your protag again? the freedom fighter? Tom, make your antagonist a secret police guy. Go with it!"<br/><br/>Be the first to frame a scene. Frame aggressively, and to the point. Narrate yourself into an immediate locale (be vague about the broader picture), and put a situation into motion. Turn to your antag, and see if they automatically start counteracting your efforst in the scene. If not, tell them to. "Okay, man. As my antagonist, it's your job to fuck shit up for me. I'm here, saving a revolutionary prisoner, and you're a politician. Figure out your involvement and brign yourself in."<br/><br/>Explain stakes once you've both OBVIOUSLY got them, and explain how resolving them works. Stress non-mutually-exclusive and rework your stakes so that they work in reflection of you antag player's. Let this be an exemplary scene.<br/><br/>Roll bones. Narrate hte outcome in 20-25 seconds.<br/><br/>Take a quick breath, then explain to the players that normally scenes are much more involved, but we're playing on a time restriction and so will do some "aggressive scene framing". Explicitly tell them your scene was a template for how they can do them, and encourage them to push hard.<br/><br/>Pass off to the next player.<br/><br/>I'm thinking in an hour you can do:<br/><br/>World, Issues, Shocks, claim squares, axis - 15 minutes.<br/>Character creation - 5-7 minutes.<br/>Antagonist creation 5-7 minutes.<br/>First scene - 5-7 minutes.<br/>Following scenes - 4-5 minutes.<br/><br/>That allows everyone to get 1-2 scenes, and a couple minutes of wrap-up.<br/><br/>The key is to keep things in motion, and be heavyhanded if things bog.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61062/#Comment_61062" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T12:53:22+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 12:53PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think for a demo having only one or two protagonists, regardless of the number of players, makes a lot of sense.

Taking the first scene is probably a good tactic, it worked will in the hour long Polaris last year. "Here's my guy doing something hardcore. You!
