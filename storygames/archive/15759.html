That's kind of a depressing hobby. I bet there's a deep rooted cause. Any ideas?<br/><br/>And how exactly does the whole magical voice thing work?

It moved when she tapped her foot. <br/><br/>I had just moved out of my parent\u2019s and into my first apartment. Most of my friends were younger and they were still in school. They\u2019d come over every week, but that left a lot of nights without cable and no one around. I stared at this girl and was overcome with the need to talk to her. I wanted to interrupt her \u201cset\u201d to introduce myself. <br/><br/>Luckily, some inner strength held me back.

They can only reproduce by  coming onto land and attracting a male as their mate (usually through a mesmerizing song). A siren's saliva is a potent narcotic and paralytic agent.  During the 'joining' process, the male is implanted with the fertilized eggs and then left to gestate.  Roughly a two weeks later, the new siren will emerge, by the dozen, from the still paralyzed male, devour him, and make their way to the sea.  Only twice the size of a man's thumb, many of the young siren will not survive but a few always seem to.  Implantation by a siren requires immediate medical attention - there are toxins you can use in the first days but you'll need a barber's tools to remove the gestating sirens after that.  With the proper tonics, one so afflicted can be on their feet in only a few days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357530/#Comment_357530" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T08:49:27+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  8:49AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing about sirens is that they don't know they're doing it.

Then they start attracting nearby men.  You see, the parasites can eat the men but not the women, something about the hormones.  That's why you never hear about old sirens, once their hosts hormone levels start to decline they tend to just eat them and move on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K." title="Ethan K."><img alt="Ethan K." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2475/3619178655_cd765940c5_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K.">Ethan K.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357539/#Comment_357539" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T09:40:56+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  9:40AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As Mathalus suggests, they're the danger of intimacy embodied.<br/><br/>Love, intimacy, even simply approaching someone requires immense trust. Every secret given, even your name, empowers the other over you. Your dreams and desires can be celebrated by the other, sure, but they can also be ridiculed and smashed, instruments of your own destruction.<br/><br/>The siren I see in modern horror is the lover that wins your trust and hidden desires, takes all your secrets and seems to love you for it. Then they make the public private, tear apart your friendships, and leave you estranged and isolated simply because they take pleasure in wrath.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357543/#Comment_357543" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T09:43:55+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  9:43AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They drive a five thousand dollar car and wear a hundred dollar suit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357548/#Comment_357548" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T10:02:23+00:00" title="February  3, 2012 10:02AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hesitate to deviate from the inherently nautical nature of the beasts.<br/><br/>Sirens are not really about women.

Living in a modern age, they see fewer and fewer ships, and those they do see tend to be the big commercial kind that don't draw many meals. So the Sirens moved to where the people were, the land.<br/><br/>The Siren's usual plan of singing to lure in unsuspecting lovers became too dangerous without sharp rocks and churning tides to protect them. The matrons of the Siren community studied the communities of men long and hard, and settled upon an event where a delightfully heady mixture of emotions was conjured up- arrests. The dread, anticipation, futile anger and desperate bargaining that preceded the police was a wine far more complex and intriguing than the pent up lust of sailors the Sirens once persisted on. <br/><br/>At the height of high tide the Siren Queen sacrificed a thousand desperate lovers and completed her race's transformation into a new form, one with more varied emotions, more frequent feasting, and vastly diminished fear of danger. <br/><br/>And so was born the Police Siren, heralding lost futures for all who heard its call.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yasha" title="Yasha"><img alt="Yasha" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/535/nC2R7IBQNACRI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yasha">Yasha</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357708/#Comment_357708" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T23:02:31+00:00" title="February  3, 2012 11:02PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sirens are artists. Not only are they born with beautiful voices, perfect pitch and an innate sense of harmony, but they just plain love to sing for hours on end, improvising with their sisters. The problem is, the human brain finds their songs irresistible. When a sailor hears them, he can't help but jump overboard in an attempt to get closer, and like any sailor, not knowing how to swim, he quickly drowns. But is this the fault of Sirens, or simply a matter of sailors not preparing themselves for the terrible, beautiful hazards of the sea?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shinobi" title="Shinobi"><img alt="Shinobi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shinobi">Shinobi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357709/#Comment_357709" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T23:16:32+00:00" title="February  3, 2012 11:16PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2012 11:17PM by Shinobi.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The siren's daily compulsion is to sing the song of the world, a deep rich rumble which intoxicates the spirits of those still capable of love and loss.  The siren must sing, for a silent siren soon succumbs to the subtle tides of the sea, and drifts as foam amongst the rocks.  There are but a few souls capable of hearing the siren's songs without succumbing to the lust for the promised and precious treasures of that enchanting, roiling cadence, but they are not the lucky ones, for they have become dead to the world and its concerns.  Your wife, your child, your brother, your parents, these are at once your reason to live, and the reason why you may die.  That man there, the one who killed his best friend over a game of dice, the one who walked away from his only son?

Naturally any and every traveller before him could have done the same, except those whom the Sirens allured even from a great distance; but it was known to all the world that such things were of no help whatever. The song of the Sirens could pierce through everything, and the longing of those they seduced would have broken far stronger bonds than chains and masts. But Ulysses did not think of that, although he had probably heard of it. He trusted absolutely to his handful of wax and his fathom of chain, and in innocent elation over his little stratagem sailed out to meet the Sirens.<br/><br/>Now the Sirens have a still more fatal weapon than their song, namely their silence. And though admittedly such a thing has never happened, still it is conceivable that someone might possibly have escaped from their singing; but from their silence certainly never. Against the feeling of having triumphed over them by one's own strength, and the consequent exaltation that bears down everything before it, no earthly powers could have remained intact.<br/><br/>And when Ulysses approached them the potent songstresses actually did not sing, whether because they thought that this enemy could be vanquished only by their silence, or because of the look of bliss on the face of Ulysses, who was thinking of nothing but his wax and his chains, made them forget their singing. <br/><br/>But Ulysses, if one may so express it, did not hear their silence; he thought they were singing and that he alone did not hear them. For a fleeting moment he saw their throats rising and falling, their breasts lifting, their eyes filled with tears, their lips half-parted, but believed that these were accompaniments to the airs which died unheard around him. Soon, however, all this faded from his sight as he fixed his gaze on the distance, the Sirens literally vanished before his resolution, and at the very moment when they were nearest to him he knew of them no longer.<br/><br/>But they--lovelier than ever--stretched their necks and turned, let their cold hair flutter free in the wind, and forgetting everything clung with their claws to the rocks. They no longer had any desire to allure; all that they wanted was to hold as long as they could the radiance that fell from Ulysses' great eyes. <br/><br/>If the Sirens had possessed consciousness they would have been annihilated at that moment. But they remained as they had been; all that had happened was that Ulysses had escaped them.</i><br/><br/>(Kafka.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wrshamilton" title="wrshamilton"><img alt="wrshamilton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wrshamilton">wrshamilton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359244/#Comment_359244" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T07:42:25+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  7:42AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hearing that which you desire enough to abandon your current life isn't a problem, it's a Vocation.
