<p>(Nope, not the big model!)</p>
<p>I remember watching some Gilbert and Sullivan shows, and realized a pattern, where after some dialogue and complications, the characters resolve to some decision ("It is decided! We must cooperate to unmask the Baron of Ruddigore!") and then everybody's read to move on... and they they sing. ("Let us repeatedly mention about how much we're going to cooperate to really unmask the Baron!")</p>
<p>Of course they break into song. It's a musical!!! But if this was a game equivalent, it's interesting to me that, even after the challenge has been basically resolved, they linger in the details. These songs usually add some humorous description, minor character development, and subtle suggestions about the nature of the decision. (The older brother is conniving, the sailor is horny, the brother hates the sailor, they're going to do it in public, etc.) Even after the point of decision has been made, lingering around it, adding details, can add a great deal to the story as it folds.</p>
<p>It's interesting to me because I think I got into the habit of basically rushing from one potential bang to the next in a story, but I can see the value in basically lingering, when the moment is right. Has anyone seen a use of this to good effect in their own game?</p>

                            This is a great insight into what you give up with aggressive scene framing. If you're just going frmo crucial point to crucial point, no one ever gets to fiddle with nonsensical little asides regarding a plan, no one ever gets to do the inconsequential but terribly fun things that can go into committing to a decision.  The similarities between the gun shopping trip in Spycraft ("nine millimeter or .45, hmmm!!") and singing in light musical comedy is dead-on for me and my group.  Shopping through 100 feats to find a cool one is not a chore when approached in this fashion, it's like adding ketchup to french fries,  you could have lived without it but who wants to live without?                        </div>

<em> just going from crucial point to crucial point</em><br/><br/>I submit to you, JD, that this is not "aggressive scene framing;" this is "bad aggressive scene framing."<br/><br/>Good aggressive scene framing is going from <em>significant</em> point to significant point.  If the details of the plan and the characterization that comes out of it is significant for your game, then you frame to do that.  It's not just plot points and bangs.<br/><br/>Dev -- now you need to create a game mechanic where, after the players resolve a question, they sing about it.  I see it much like the Irish Drinking Song on Whose Line.  GO!                        </div>

<p>Ahhhh ... mixing G and S in the same comic opera.  That would explain why their works are so frequently riddled with incoherence.</p>
<p><em>( Somebody had to be the first to open the jokes, and I am not proud )</em></p>
<p>That having been said, I agree that the songs serve as a pacing mechanism ... sometimes both before <em>and</em> after events.  I'm thinking particularly of the "Paradox" song in Pirates ... first the Major General sings a song describing how guilty he is about having deceived the pirates, then the pirates recruit Frederick ("A Paradox") following which they sing a song about the fact that the Major General deceived them.  Then they sing a song about revenging themselves upon the Major General (who, it should be noted, deceived them).  That's iterating the importance of Frederick revealing the Major General's deception, both before and after.</p>

<p>Something else you get from the songs are also simply revelling in success or defeat. I'm thinking about a song near the end of <em>Yeoman</em> where a bride is repeating "Rapture!" and the groom is repeating "Dreadful!" over and over again. So revelling in that is fun too.</p>
<p>This is all in some way a response to my own (possibly overdone) aggressive scene framing. The technique has been very, very helpful to me, but I can see a skill to be learnt in knowing when to loosen my grip on the pacing and let things mellow for a bit before the next event.</p>

                            Repetition is a function of the medium; read Richard III's opening monologue some time.  It's easy to miss an important point among the screams of adjacent wounded bears and what all, so the salient bits tend to get hammered.  The same thing applies to anything you're trying to explain <em>while singing</em>, although I'd suggest that you don't even need to understand the language to enjoy Gilbert and Sullivan.    <br/><br/>"Pretty lady!  Pirate!  Fancy man!  Pretty Lady sing now!"<br/><br/>It is interesting that there's no incentive to do this in tabletop play, since it is such a powerful technique on stage.  There should be a Norse game where you don't get rewarded for doing something cool until another player re-tells the story in a GoÃƒÂ°i's hall.                        </div>

My point is that this is a value judgment - whoever makes that value judgment may find themselves dinged by a differing value attached to the things they're skipping on the part of the other players. You are not risking nothing when you scene-frame.                        </div>

What I was saying was that this analogy, of decision + potentially needless but always fun elaboration in Gilbert and Sullivan and in gaming seemed to ring true to me in the area of scene framing and other "significant scene" techniques.                        </div>

                            This has been a very interesting discussion, but mostly it's made me want to run a game with mechanical rewards for treating it like a musical - including improvising lyrics and making up songs on the fly.  (Tying this to the impro discussion, I bet with some practice you could get people able to make up really, really bad but funny songs in play.  Johnstone managed it with verse!)  I happen to have a professional musician in my group who could totally do the music on the fly, which would be SO COOL, but I have no idea how common serious musical literacy is among gamers.  Still, imagine if we could sell RP to composers and musical theater buffs - "It's a musical, but you make it up yourself!"<br/><br/>Tony, I like the idea of having a 'chorus' in a game somehow, to reiterate and refine what happened on stage.  What if that could be a way to allow RPGs to have an audience in a meaningful way - people who aren't playing in the way we generally understand it, but are still participating?<br/><br/>I really don't think I have anything useful to add, except to say that this conversation is making me have Ideas.  Dangerous Ideas.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>Mark: Arguably, I'm talking about "Song: Talk about the Resolved Stakes", and then maybe after that there's "Song: Elaborte new Situation" where you could play off of new elements introduced in the post-resolution song. And I think I'm with JDCorley here that's its still a tricky skill - I mean ideally, you don't have to negotiate "oh, let's go backtrack and eat bagels and then keep going" because that slows your momentum down a bit. (But then, sitting around eating bagels when you want to save the world is also losing momentum.)</p>
<p>Bah, this is becoming a discussion. Let me come up with a game mechanic!</p>
<p>The actor (who did the action) goes first. He takes the agreed-upon won stakes, and makes up a stanza of four or lines that sounds more or less rhymey or musical. The lyrics can be anything that implies your opinion about other people / what may happen / what you think of what happened / what you think other's may do / what you think of yourself. For each Song Token you spend (and you start with zero) you can make one of the sentences suggest a <em>slightly</em> new fact about the <em>effect</em> and fallout and consequences of the action. After your stanza, someone else takes over.</p>
<p>Now, every time someone takes a previously mentioned suggestion and works it into their own stanza, that person gets 1 Song Token; but you can never get more than 1 Song Token from someone's stanza. So if I sing "I think he's bleeding quite a bit" and then next you're singing "I see there's quite a nasty bruise!" I get a token there. (And I can spend it again as mentioned above.)</p>
<p>At any time, the affected party can call Penultimate Stanza. This means that she sings as many stanzas as necessary now, and she can even change the meter/rhyme up a bit. Her lyrics must take into accoutn each fact about the effect/fallout/etc. and either accept or reject each. (The initial actor gets 1 XP for each rejected choices, and the affected actor gets 1 XP for each accepted one.) Once she's done, everyone says one last go of the very first stanza, and you're done.</p>
<p>LESS MECHANICAL VERSION: As above, but forget the bloody song tokens and XP. At the Penultimate Stanze, the affected party just accepts or rejects whichever sugested effects have been proposed in song.</p>

<p>Now, given the above, we see the virtue of conflict resolution versus task resolution. Because who wants to spend so many stanzas singing about "I hit the goblin for 2d6 damage"?</p>
<p>Actually, I'd love to demonstrate this. Shall I start up a thread to play this out?</p>

<blockquote>Hey, maybe our next book club book should be this.</blockquote>
Oh my goodness. I love that book. I've got it upstairs. You know I used to play piano to accompany improv troupes, right? OK.<br/><br/>An interesting point is that we're concentrating on one type of song: the "let's discuss what we've just done" song. There's also songs like this:<br/><br/>1. The "Let me introduce myself" song (e.g. "A wandering minstrel I"). Every major character gets one of these.<br/>2. The "Let me complicate the plot" song (e.g. "Our great Mikado, virtuous man" or "When Frederick was a little lad")<br/>3. The "Let's move the plot along" song (e.g. ""Hold, monsters" or "With Catlike Tread" from Pirates of Penzance).<br/><br/>I'd love a G&amp;S game where your character sheet consisted of everything you sang in your opening song. That would be great. If someone writes this game, I'm happy to accompany it on piano (if, you know, we're in the same country and there's a piano in the room).<br/><br/>That thing about "Song of Truth" has persuaded me to finally get off my arse and buy Polaris.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

In fact, outside of outright song, I'm pretty sure that the general ideas here can be found in several designs already. <br/>

                            Dude! I had this plan to write an improv folk-rock opera larp game about a year ago, but then a whole bunch of people said I would never be able to find folks who could improvize lyrics and harmony vocals.  I guess they were wrong.  Let me dig up my notes...                        </div>

                            I've never seen Wyrd but I'd really like to.  I was thinking that other players would have to tell the tale of your awesomeness to allow some mechanical reward.                        </div>

                            Found it!  (This is part of a LiveJournal post from Feb 2005, and was inspired by "chamber musicals" like <i>The Last Five Years</i> and <i>A Light in the Piazza</i>):<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>In order to play a game of <i>Cue the Music</i> (working title), you need to purchase (in a pre-prepared module) or personally prepare the following...<br/><br/>1. <b>Backing Music for the Game</b><br/><br/>This can be pre-recorded on a CD or in digital format, or, if you've got more balls, written out in some sort of notation to be performed live during the game by one or more instrumentalists.  The degree of flexibility that exists in music performed live depends on the comfort levels of the members of the troupe (including instrumentalists and players).  Experienced and confident groups may have a few general notes about chord structure (jam band!) or one or more melody lines jotted down (jazz!) and just make up the rest as they go, giving the instrumentalists (as well as the players) room for improvisation and enhanced personal expression.<br/><br/>The music for the game is broken down into various sections that we'll call "scenes."  There may be a pause in the music between scenes or the entire game may be through-composed (like Wagner!).  Most times there will be a break and an opportunity to prep a bit for the next scene.  Each scene is arranged for a certain number of players (and instrumentalists, if not pre-recorded), leading to individual arias, duets, trios, quartets, larger groups, and, occasionally, big chorus numbers.  Simple scenes have the same number of people involved all the way through, though more complex scenes will have different people involved in different times.  In a module written for an experienced troupe, a duet might give way to a short aria, a choral response, and then a reprise of the duet, all in the same scene.<br/><br/>Certain portions of individual scenes may have scripted lyrics, such as a pre-determined chorus that repeats several times in the scene, or a reoccurring lyrical motif that shows up in various scenes throughout the course of the game.  Any predetermined lyrical lines are often kept intentionally general and vague, to make them appropriate for as many situations as possible, though some scripts are more specific.  Aside from the pre-scripted lyrics, each scene is broken up into a general structure that assigns sections of music to various players and groups of players.  Often times the structure, musical outline, and set lyrics will be written out together, such as in this sketchy example:
<ul>Scene 4: A Simple Duet for Player B, Player C, and Acoustic Guitar<br/>4/4, medium tempo, folky<br/><br/>Intro (2-4 bars), Guitar Only --  ||: G Am C G | G Am C G <img alt=":|" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/neutral.png" title=":|"/>| (repeat as needed)<br/>Verse 1 (4 bars), Player B -- | G Am C G | G Am C G | Gm D C G | G Am C G |<br/>Verse 2 (4 bars), Player C -- | G Am C G | G Am C G | Gm D C G | G Am C G |<br/>*Bridge 1 (2 bars), Players B + C -- | F F C C | G G D D |<br/>Chorus 1 (4 bars), Players B + C -- | G D Am C | G C D D | G Am C Am | G Am C G |<ul>We keep talking, though we both know how the story ends<br/>The curtain drops and friendship doesn't matter anymore<br/>Is it possible to leave no broken hearts when you go?<br/>Thought I had the answer but now I don't know</ul>Verse 3...<br/>Verse 4...<br/>*Bridge 2...<br/>Chorus 2...<br/>Instrumental Break...<br/>*Bridge 3...<br/>Chrorus 3...<br/>Verse 5 (2 bars)...<br/>End</ul>
2. <b>Character, Setting, Situation</b><br/><br/>Characters and the details of situation and setting are usually undefined by the module and game organizers do not typically prepare them in advance.  Instead, before the game begins, the players have a short discussion in which parts are assigned, a setting is chosen, and essential conflicts are introduced.  This should take 15-20 minutes, once you get the hang of things.  Overplanning leaves little room for improvisation and make it more likely that there will be confusion or mutually exclusive ideas about what is "supposed" to happen in play.<br/><br/>To make pre-game brainstorming easier, most modules (either purchased, borrowed, or written by the organizers) will include important thoughts and suggestions on choosing characters and structuring play.  For instance, you might read something like:
<ul>Player B disappears from the game in the middle of Scene 6 and then doesn't appear again until midway through the last Scene (#11).  In past games of The Death of Archibald Anderson [this particular module], the role of Player B has often been that of the "Archibald Anderson" mentioned in the title, dying in Scene 6 and then reappearing in Scene 11 in various capacities (a faked death? a ghost? a visit to heaven or hell?).  Occasionally, clever troupes have done other things with Player B, making him/her Archibald's mother, a childhood friend, or someone entirely unrelated to the title character.<br/><br/>Player B performs all of Scene 3 solo, shares duets with Players C (Scene 4) and F (Scene 6), and appears, as previously mentioned, in the middle of the giant, final Scene 11 with every other character in the game.</ul>
Similarly, possible situations and setting bits will be offered in the prepared texts for the game, but, during the pre-game discussions, troupe are welcome to throw these out the window and create whatever characters and situations that they like, or, as some troupes do, simply make things up as they go.  Often, troupes have fun perverting and creating variations on modules that have been performed over and over again, setting <i>The Death of Archibald Anderson</i> in outer space or on a reality TV show.<br/><br/>3. <b>Signs: Locations, Props, Special Actions, Multiple Characters</b><br/><br/>As in traditional Chinese opera and other minimalist theater forms, these kinds of games are meant to be played on a bare stage or open space where there is no prepared set or props.  This can create a challenge for groups that want to present complex or exotic stories that would normall require extensive material preparations.  To overcome this, simple gestures are developed to mime the missing stuff.  There could be the "getting on a horse/getting off the horse" cues, the "drawing my sword" cue, the "internal monologue" cue, the "talking on my cell phone" cue, the "now I'm underwater" cue, the "this scene takes place in Archibald's bedroom" cue, and the like.<br/><br/>Realize that most of these things can be improvisationally mimed without any special preparations, but critical or commonplace-but-potentially-unclear cues might need to be planned out in advance.  Also, if one player is taking on the roles normally assigned to multiple players, cues such as a hat or a tie might be necessary to distinguish different characters.<br/><br/>4. <b>So How Do You Play?</b><br/><br/>As you might have guessed by now, this is a singing game.  Think operetta, rock opera, or (ugh!) musicals.  The different players improvise lyrics to go along with the bars that they have been assigned, often pulling double-duty to improvise harmony vocals to other players' singing or singing different lyrics at the same time (interwoven back-and-forth or just sung in complete contrast).  Players are expected to prep the music beforehand (listening to it over and over again, to familiarize themselves with it) but then freestyle the lyrics, not coming in with pre-planned things to sing.<br/><br/>The narrative emerges from the improvised lyrics.  One player might sing, "I can't believe you're leaving me now, after all this time together" and suddenly that puts expectations on the other player(s) in the scene to respond appropriately.  Good players can work together to pace things in aesthetically pleasing ways, working up to big choruses or dramatic sections of music, making the tension rise and fall, revealing information at critical junctures, and setting up future interactions.  The best troupes are full of players who can not only act, pantomime, sing, and improvise beautiful and interesting lyrics, but also have the familiarity and comfort of experience, and thus are good at reading each other and providing space for others to shine.<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>Of course, if I was writing it now I'm probably make it more G&amp;S and less... emo.  Oh well.  There's something in the same general ballpark.                        </div>
