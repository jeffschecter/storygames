Something simple, which you can cook <i>fairly</i> quickly, then eat without interrupting your game too much. Maybe you stop the game to eat, but it's not too much trouble. And nothing too expensive.<br/><br/>In this thread, please ask about something you'd like to cook. Then someone will tell you how to cook it. We've got people from various parts of the world, so we can exchange recipes and cook some new things. Be aware, when you describe recipes, that ingredients aren't standard worldwide: thus, if you mention Turkish chilli peppers, they're not available everywhere. So describe anything odd and we'll find substitutes.<br/><br/>And you can totally ask about things like sausages and pork and...you know, it doesn't all have to be Szechuan cuisine. So, you can ask me how to cook sausages and mash and I'll tell you.<br/><br/>Oh, and you can volunteer recipes that are emblematic of your part of the world. So, I've no idea what a typical Australian dish is, but I'd like to hear it.<br/><br/>To start, could someone tell me how to cook bean chilli?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333278/#Comment_333278" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T19:44:35+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  7:44PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>So, I've no idea what a typical Australian dish is, but I'd like to hear it.</blockquote>\nI cooked some kangaroo on a barbeque when I had three Norwegian gamers visit my place early last year...they might have just been polite, but they said they liked it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333291/#Comment_333291" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T00:37:43+00:00" title="July  6, 2011 12:37AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2011 12:47AM by Teataine.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was about to start this thread!

But if you ask me about local foods I'll be glad to describe a few.<br/><br/>It's totally not local (it's not even mexican) but I've been known to make various tortilla wraps. It's super-fast and not complicated. I make either "fresh" ones (with lettuce, prosciutto, various cheeses and cherry tomatoes) or "hot" ones (with sauteed ground beef or chicken, kidney beans, corn, red &amp; green peppers, tomatoes, chilli, onions &amp; garlic (and sometimes cheese and diced apples)). The only thing I dislike about wraps is how the ones you can buy are usually full of preservatives and flavour enhancers, but making your own is just so time consuming. Provided you have time, homemade spelt tortillas are the fucking best. If someone wants I can describe the above in more detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333292/#Comment_333292" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T01:45:58+00:00" title="July  6, 2011  1:45AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My bean chili recipe is pretty simple.<br/><br/>For two people:<br/>1 onion, chopped finely<br/>1 tin of tomatoes (I use Sainsbury's Chair de Tomate)<br/>1 lot of black beans (I use Sainsbury's organic black beans)<br/>1 pepper, chopped to a similar size to the beans<br/>1 clump of fresh coriander (some people don't like this so you could skip it), chopped<br/>Mole<br/><br/>Mole is the sauce which consists of whatever you have to hand. In my case this usually means:<br/>Some chilis (I've got some Hatch chipotle chilis but if you can't get these, and it's not easy outside New Mexico, then your favourite chilis, sometimes I use Cholula chili sauce, from Asda or Waitrose). I remove the seeds and soak them in a little hot water. Then I use scissor to chop them more finely.<br/>Dried coriander 1/2 tsp<br/>Dried cumin 1/4 tsp<br/>Cocoa powder 1/2 tsp<br/>Some garlic<br/>Quite a lot of black pepper<br/>Cinnamon powder,  ginger (root preferably) if you like<br/><br/>You can get the mole together first, including that hot water, to make a paste in the frying pan but I usually do the onions first, browning them slowly, then chuck in everything else except the fresh coriander. I then cook for a bit, 10-15 minutes, take off the heat, add the chopped coriander and then serve with rice or tortillas, grated cheese, sour cream. The dish is even better if you cook the chili the day before and just leave to sit. Reheat and add the coriander just before serving.<br/><br/>I'd like to cook the best cheesecake in the world.

Cut tofu into d6 sized cubes. <br/><br/>Lightly oil a non-stick or cast iron skillet and place over medium high heat. Allow oil to heat slightly and add tofu and a dash of soy suace. Toss until evenly and lightly golden born. Remove from skillet and drain. Add a little oil back in and turn the heat way up, then throw the tofu back in. Saute until it gets nice and brown, adding a liberal jot of soy sauce and then a bunch of nutritional yeast to coat the tofu. Toss it hard to get the nutritional yeast on everything, then serve it hot. You can just eat it plain, and you might, but it's great protein with anything. Vegetables, peanut sauce or sriracha.

You'll want at least two bunches, because kale is not the most substantial of foods. Wash it thoroughly and dry it even more thoroughly. YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. Do not suffer the kale to remain wet. Cut it into inch-wide strips and toss it in a big ol' bowl with just enough heat tolerant oil (I like grapeseed, but canola is good here) to coat the leaves, which is less than you think. I like to do all this before gamers appear.<br/><br/>Once the fellowship is gathered, preheat your oven to 400F. Toss in hella salt. Spread the kale out in a single layer on a baking sheet or four - you'll probably wind up working in batches, unless you have a lot of oven space. Put the kale into the oven for about five minutes, then check for crispness, checking every 2 minutes after that. You're looking for the kale to be kind of like a fresh potato chip,but if it starts to burn, stop cooking it, obviously. Once it's out of the oven, immediately top with black pepper and, if you like, any other spices that appeal to you (I like smoked paprika). Then eat them while they're warm. This is way better than the usual chips.<br/><br/>I like to serve this with thin slices of hard savory cheese, like Dry Jack or Parmesan, and a light-bodied white wine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333355/#Comment_333355" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T11:18:40+00:00" title="July  6, 2011 11:18AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob's Southwest Chili (aka Fajita Chili)<br/><br/>As noted in the last chili recipe, chili is generally best when made a day ahead of time and allowed to sit under low heat for many hours. Like, you can put it in a crock pot on low all day.<br/><br/>This recipe evolved after I learned how to make fajitas. Sometimes I call it fajita chili.<br/><br/>Ingredients:<br/>1/2 onion (Red or sweet yellow is best. White are too harsh.)<br/>1 bell pepper (I prefer red, yellow, or orange ones. But you can use green if you like the stronger flavor.)<br/>1 pound chicken or cheap steak (a double batch with both is also good)<br/>1 can black beans<br/>1 can kidney beans<br/>1 small can corn<br/>1 can stewed or diced tomatoes, flavored (I often end up using "Italian Style")<br/><br/>Preparing the meat<br/>Cumin is important, it's the most significan "mexican food" flavoring<br/>Chili Powder<br/>McCormick's Montreal Steak or Montreal Chicken, accordingly<br/>Lemon juice for chicken or red wine vinegar for steak<br/><br/>Cube the meat. Marinade it with the "Preparing the meat" items while you chop the veggies.<br/><br/>Chop the onion and pepper to pieces the size of kidney beans.<br/><br/>In a large frying pan, heat some olive oil. Brown the meat lightly. Then add the peppers and onions. You are basically making fajitas in the frying pan, except that everything is cut into small pieces instead of long strips. Use pretty high heat, but not insanely high if you have a hardcore stove.<br/><br/>In a large pot (or a crock pot, if you're going to let is sit for hours), heat the kidney beans, black beans, corn, and tomatoes. Drain the beans about halfway before adding them and drain the corn completely. Cook at about 3/4 heat (or start the crock pot at high).<br/><br/>Once the onions have cooked clear and the peppers have started to blacken a hair, dump the fajitas into the beans. The beans should just be bubbling pretty good about this time.<br/><br/>Turn to medium-low heat and let it cook for as long as you have time for. It needs at least 1/2 hour for the flavors to mix together. Taste it and add more spices if you like, but don't rush the spices - they can sneak up on you, especially because you spiced the meat and that flavor won't hit hard until you're a few bites in.<br/><br/>Serve with tortilla chips. Shredded cheese sprinkled on top is good. A dollop of sour cream is also good. A sprinkle of chopped onions would be good too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333365/#Comment_333365" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T12:26:01+00:00" title="July  6, 2011 12:26PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Blini with creme fraiche and caviar is as easy as a trip to Whole Foods and makes an ideal casual finger food.

Here are two dishes that my area is known for.<br/><br/>So there's <i>jota</i>, a farmers' soup. It's the best the next day (leave it in the fridge overnight) and especially if you've been working outdoors, or hiking in the mountains or something. There are various recipes, but here's one I use. You're going to need:<br/>-half a kilo of sour (fermented) turnip mustard (if you can't get this, fermented cabbage or sauerkraut should do)<br/>-1 can of brown or white beans<br/>-several bay laurel leaves<br/>-a few cloves of garlic<br/>-a pair of sausages (I don't know how our sausages relate to British ones, but you can use pig shank instead)<br/>-salt &amp; pepper<br/>-a spoon of butter<br/><br/>Peel and mince the garlic. Melt the butter in a pot at low temperature, and add the garlic. Wash and peel the potatoes, then dice them. Put them in with the garlic. Cut the sausages into thick slices and put them in, too. Add water to cover everything and cook on low for as long as it takes to make the potatoes tender.<br/>Wash the shredded turnip and cook it in a different pot for about 15 minutes, drain the water then add the turnip to the first pot, along with the beans. Add the laurel leaves (depends on taste, I use around 5), and ground pepper. Keep on cooking slowly but take it off the fire before the potatoes start falling apart. It should look like <a href="http://papasinka.blog.siol.net/files/2010/02/jota.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Serve with bread.<br/><br/>The second one is <i>frtalja</i> and it's much simpler. You're going to need:<br/>-one or two eggs per person<br/>-0,25l of milk per person<br/>-flour<br/>-salt<br/>-fresh fennel leaves<br/>-diced prosciutto or pancetta<br/>-parmigiano cheese and rucola optional<br/><br/>Stir the eggs with milk and salt then add just enough flour that it gets a bit thicker (something like pancakes). Let it rest for a bit, chop the fennel and stir it into the batter. Heat up some olive oil in a pan and pour in the batter in very thick (depending on how much mixture you've got you might need to do this several times). Sprinkle the still liquid mixture with prosciutto and flip after it has been baked at the bottom. After it's finished pop it on a plate and cover with cheese and rucola. Cut in.<br/>It should look like <a href="http://www.slovenia.info/pictures%5Cprogram%5C1%5C2009%5CFrtalja-007_222826.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333375/#Comment_333375" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T13:06:43+00:00" title="July  6, 2011  1:06PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My friends and I rarely prepare game night food. Usually, we're grabbing some fast food on the way to whomever's house. Occassionally, though, we will make some snacks.<br/><br/>My particular favorite is mochi crunch popcorn:<br/>Take one part US buttery popcorn, one part Japanese chili bits crackers or arare, several dashes of Nori Komi Furikake, and a lot of Hawaiian ingenuity, and toss together while the popcorn is hot.<br/><br/>...for those who don't know what arare is (aside from Arare-chan a la Dr. Slump), they are small Japanese rice crackers (sometimes referred to as mochi crunch in Hawaii, though this tends to be a broad generalization), typically flavored with soy sauce, much like tinier cousins of the senbei cracker. Chili bits tend to be the most popular variety, which have a bit of spice to them (sometimes in varying degrees of pain)<br/><br/>...and as for Nori Komi Furikake, its a mixture of seaweed, sesame seeds, bonito flakes, and a little bit of salt and sugar. Typically served on top of rice, but friggin delicious on popcorn. There are actually many types of furikake, and maybe you'd like to experiment. I've had limited success with other varieties, like the curry flake furikake. Best to avoid the kim chee furikake, though.<br/><br/>As for the Hawaiian bit? The idea I believe originated with the Hawaiian brand Typhoon Popcorn. But they tend to be expensive, so I get the ingredients individually instead (and I get to avoid their pouch of nasty butter-flavored oil).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333377/#Comment_333377" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T13:21:51+00:00" title="July  6, 2011  1:21PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so here a few more.

It is a sausage made from pork and beef or veal, held together by potato starch flour. Usually it has a low content of meat, around 60%-70%, explaining the low price.  It is not spicy, rather bland to be honest so it is popular with children too. If I could not find actual Falukorv I'd go looking for something cheap with the meat ground to a fine paste, no chunky sausages here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333505/#Comment_333505" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T12:30:13+00:00" title="July  7, 2011 12:30PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite>Graham,<br/><br/>We do a lot of traditional New Mexican food for game nights but it doesn't fit into the fast category.

I don't know why.)<br/>Taco seasoning (can buy as mix in some places; otherwise use cumin, chili powder, pepper, other southwest US spices)<br/>Salsa (any kind)<br/>Sour cream<br/>Cheese, thinly grated (some places sell packs of shredded "Mexican" cheese; otherwise, cheddar or similar will do)<br/>Green onions, diced (aka scallions, spring onions, salad onions, green shallots, onion sticks, or syboes)<br/>Lettuce, shredded<br/>Corn chips<br/><br/><br/>Mix the seasoning into the refried beans.<br/>Spread the beans onto the pizza pan in a flat layer. Thickness to taste. About the height of a USB plug is about right (under 5mm).<br/>Spread a <i>thin</i> layer of sour cream on top of the bean layer.<br/>Spread a layer of salsa over the sour cream.<br/>Scatter the cheese in a layer.<br/>Scatter the onions.<br/><br/>Refrigerate assembled pizza pan(s) until ready to use.<br/><br/>Heat pan at around 400\xba F until the cheese starts to melt.

You can use white or whole wheat flour. Basically you add some flour into a bowl. Add some fat (veggie shortening, lard, renderings, NOT BUTTER). Add some cold water. Mix well and form into a ball. Let rest for awhile. The break off pieces and roll out flat. You can do this by hand or use a rolling pin. Cook on a cast iron griddle unto done. You'll see little brown spots and smell cooked dough. These will be used to get at the beans, etc..<br/><br/>Fry Bread, Dine - Flour, some baking powder, salt, fat (same as for tortillas). Do the exact same thing as the tortillas except \u2026. in a cast iron skillet pour 1/4 in oil (high temp). Heat up really hot and place a rolled out dough into the oil. It will puff up like crazy. Flip and brown on both sides. Make a lot. Serve hot with honey and/or adobo sauce. Works with whole wheat flour too.<br/><br/>Salad - Take a large salad bowl. Add olive oil, basaltic vinegar, local dark honey, black pepper. Mix well and coat the bowl with the dressing. Add in your mixed green salad and toss to coat. Add coarse grain salt. <br/><br/>Spinach Dish - I don't remember the Spanish name for this. In a pan add some butter and olive oil. Heat up. Add spinach leaves, red peppers flakes, and salt. Saute quickly. Add 1/2 water and cover. Simmer until done.<br/><br/>Sometimes the Fry Bread - Dine is swapped out for Zuni bread which is a oven fired sourdough type of bread. All of these recipes vary (I have several of each) depending on who you talk to. <br/><br/>Sometime the Spinach Dish is swapped out for native corn and native squash cooked in butter with onions, garlic, salt, pepper                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333581/#Comment_333581" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-08T06:32:27+00:00" title="July  8, 2011  6:32AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2011 6:32AM by Teataine.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>BTW, what is "corn salad"?</blockquote>\nMaybe you know it under the name rapunzel?

Northern NM is more of a thin soup, southern is more likely to be thick and creamy, similar to a cream of mushroom soup.

Hatch chile is hotter than similar breeds like Anaheim and pretty much only grows in New Mexico.
