You are cranky, opinionated, prejudiced and eccentric. You are also collaborating with a number of your peers -- the other players -- on the construction of an encyclopedia describing some historical period (possibly of a fantastic world).<br/><a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2003/11/lexicon_an_rpg.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.20by20room.com/2003/11/lexicon_an_rpg.html</a></blockquote>\nAnyone interested in playing? To keep it interesting, I'd be looking to recruit players from multiple places and encourage you to forward this along to anyone you think might be interested.<br/>We've got enough to play, but still want more.<br/>If you are interested <a href="http://lexicon-rpg.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">go here</a> and tap in.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
