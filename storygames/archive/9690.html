It was a light heartened and in some places hilarious space pulp romp of a game. Here are the highlights:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lady B disguised via a spell as Capt. Hollas, leading two marines down to the Owl and bumping into Snargle shape changed into Capt. Hollas leading his 'captive', Cyrus, on their way back onto the Hand of Sorrow to rescue Lady B. Cyrus whips out a pair of blasters from behind his back and takes out the marines while Snargle leaps on the other Capt. Hollas just as Lady B drops her spell. "Um, boobs. I wasn't expecting boobs!" "It's me you idiot!"<br/>\n<br/>\n- After that Snargle continually referred to Lady B as a Goblin and wondered frequently out loud why she'd pick a human form with a big nose, large arse and small tits. Much to the increasing annoyance of Cyrus - and giving him plenty of opportunities to hit his Key of Hidden Longing coming to her defense.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Snargle (after learning the Mimic Shape tag for his Goblin trait) disguising himself as a bowl of petunias, refusing to fly the ship in a huff over Cyrus hitting him for being rude about Lady B. "Look Snargle, I don't remember that bowl of petunias being there before so I'm guessing that's you. I'd really appreciate it if you'd change into something I can have a serious discussion with!"<br/>\n<br/>\n- There were a couple of great refresh scenes with Vance and Lady B. Vance smooching into her cabin on the Owl with a bottle of wine and Lady B giving him the very cold shoulder as Vance had failed a fair few roles and looked to be quite incompetent. Classic moment where he leaves her cabin, slamming the door, then opens it again, takes the forgotten bottle of wine and slams it again. There was a brilliant Mal &amp; Innara vibe going on between them, excellent.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Deciding that the fuel for the Owl was big bags of coal dust<br/>\n<br/>\n- Leo the deaf &amp; dumb coal delivery boy who tapped words on a keypad on his forearm, the words appearing on a clockwork display unit on his chest. This came about as the characters openly discussed stealing the coal forgetting about the delivery boy right next to them. I wrote "Hi. My name is Leo. I'm deaf and mute" and held it up. So they carried on discussing the coal theft. I then wrote "I'm also a very good lip reader" while miming the action of frantically typing onto my forearm.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Chased by a Pirate vessel, the Stranded Whale captained by the Dread Pirate Carson (the Pirate King's lieutenants all had the title "Dread Pirate") Snargle performs some amazing piloting into a massive storm cloud. Lady B channels an impressive bolt of lighting to disable the Stranded Whale, succeeding and making it live up to its name. With the cloud interfering with the wireless, they resort to the back-up comms array - the nose cone of the Owl flips down and a huge pair of flags telescopes out, sending semaphore signals to the Stranded Whale.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Stranded Whale cripples the Owl with a missile but more excellent piloting from Snargle get's the Owl docked with the Whale, they subdue the pirate crew and Kale reckons they could use the engines from the Whale hooked into the nav/piloting system of the Owl. So with the Owl grappled to the Whale they continue on their way to the Remants.<br/>\n<br/>\n- They finally make it to the Pirate King, Vance having learnt the Secret of the True Course from a captured pirate. I played the Pirate King as a civilised man who feel he is somewhat above his pirate 'employees' (thinking about it, a little bit like Captain Shakespeare in the movie/book Stardust). He seems a little surpirsed at Lady B's arrival, especially as there's a lady with eyes like daggers standing with him at the welcoming party.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Uriah declares Vance can have the position of Dread Pirate if he wishes, having bested one of his Lieutenants "Especially impressive considering that small rust bucket of a ship you own sir". Snargle queries the treatment of pirate prisoners, but Cyrus quickly changes the subject and accepts.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lady B, unperturbed by Uriah's obvious lady friend, states "There will be a wedding...", Uriah goes pale at this stuttering "But my love, it's been 6 years...things have changed". lady B continues "...between me and Cyrus Vance!"<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a very relieved look on his face Uriah claps his hands, calls for a feast and we called it a night.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Mr Harper for being the catalyst behind a very enjoyable afternoon of play!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215370/#Comment_215370" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T09:49:45+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  9:49AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2009 9:57AM by Graham.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was the sign-up, playing Vance. It was a superb game session. What a great group.<br><br>Surprisingly, given that much of Lady Blackbird is based on The Shadow Of Yesterday, it clicked for me in a way TSOY never did. It's partly because the Keys are all angled at other characters, which gets you going straight away. <br><br>The brief descriptions of planets worked well for us. Nightport was particularly fun. I would personally like more planets: and I mean on that map, not just In A Supplement Available Soon. There only really seemed to be one route to the Remnants, so we took it. It would be nice if there had been choices. It was a short journey, too, where I'd like more of an odyssey.<br><br>John, one rules point. Why have you used the succeed-or-fail, GM-chooses-a-Difficulty-Number model? It seems rather unnatural to me. Keeping in genre for Firefly, I'd expect degrees of success rather than just succeed or fail: for example, you bodge it completely; you come tantalisingly close but fail; you succeed, but embarrassingly; you succeed with unexpected brilliance. Personally, I'd prefer the number of dice that roll 4-6 to indicate degree of success. <br><br>It's good. I liked it.

I especially like Lady B's flourish with the wedding at the end.<br><br>Graham: I think you could certainly play it that way, counting degrees of success. Another idea floated in another thread was to count both successful dice and failed dice and read the mix to determine the ratio of good and bad in the outcome. So it would be a bit like Otherkind, where rolling more dice both helps you succeed and also creates more trouble. I think I'll try it that way next time we play.<br><br>I, too, prefer more of an odyssey (3-4 sessions), not a straight run to the Remnants.

As an example, Lady B combined Imperial Noble -&gt; Etiquette; Charm -&gt; Charisma, Presence, Command, Nobles; Cunning -&gt; Deception to convince Capt. Hollas that she was Lady so and so (not Blackbird) on an important secret mission for the Imperials and he was to free her from the brig etc etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player in question was quite convincing in his argument for each trait/tag so I let him use them all. Do you think I was too lenient?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I felt some sort of PTA Fan Mail mechanic would have been handy as so many cool things occurred that should have been rewarded. Maybe reduce the number of pool dice (say to 5) and let players gift each other additional dice from a finite shared pool - a bit like the Style Dice from S7S.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of using the ratio of successes/failures to determine degrees of success. Will try it out next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nGraham - it'll be interesting to read how the game goes with your players.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nPaul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215717/#Comment_215717" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T09:42:32+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  9:42AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul: For any roll, the player chooses <b>one</b> Trait that applies, then adds any tags from that trait.

One problem, for us, was that the game starts outside Haven, with Lady Blackbird heading to the Remnants. With that in mind, there's little reason to visit anywhere other than Haven and Nightport.<br><br>I'd personally start the game far over on the left side of the map: with the Hand Of Sorrow heading back to the Imperial Worlds. Then you've got the whole map to cross to the Remnants. Also, I'd have planets at the top, so there's an alternative path.<br><br>John, something to make clear in the rules: does a Refresh scene refresh things for both player characters in the scene or just the one that called the scene?<br><br>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
