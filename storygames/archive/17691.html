Cartooner will soon be available in English, I want to translate (I'm just waiting for the end playtest! Honestly I am really enjoying reading the Actual Play of the various groups, look like Loney Tunes cartoons!)<br/><b>I'm using google transaltor... sorry! <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/></b><br/><br/>I like Toons RPG! But there was: too much math, I do not like hit points, then it is too dependent on the skill of the narrator the success of a game. <b> wanted a narrative game in which we can create a cartoon and with a gaming setup immediately. Toon was also fast in character creation, but it was often to use the golden rule to bring in some good scenes, but here happen almost automatically and without having to use the golden rule (indeed, the golden rule is not allowed!).</b> <br/><br/>Regarding the game: The mechanics are simple! The group creates the characters giving marks and constraints (no numbers needed, only description). In Cartooner the group will play a "Designer of Cartoons", together will create some characters, Exemple a group of 4 people create: Tom, Jerry and Aunt May.  <br/><br/>Each player (no the Actors, Jhon, Francesco, Andrea the Designer have this skills) will have skills, based on the physics of Cartoons:" Logic not logic, I have it, brush", that you can use to narrate the scenes!<br/><b>Logic not logic</b> "If you do not know will not fall down!". If you do not realize you can walk on the ceiling stay there for hours. <br/><b>I have it</b>: Everything you need you got behind your back or in your pants, on a scale of 12 meters long with a tiller!<br/><b>Brush</b>: Suppose that you have to cross a mountain and you do not want to do that? What is the problem draw a tunnel!<br/>Just one of these skills can you say that your level is Formidable, this means you will have more chance of success (each in a special scene is usable only once). <br/><br/>You throw 2D6 (example 2.3), adding the results (5).<br/><br/>Formidable level:<br/>Success: 6 and up.<br/>Partial success: from 3 to 5.<br/>Failure: 2<br/><br/>Newbie level (normal):<br/>Success: 8 and up.<br/>Partial success: from 5 to 7.<br/>Failure: 2 to 4.<br/><br/><br/><b>The game is narrative</b>, each player controls all the characters, there are rules to determine who is at that moment the Designer, Producer (which controls at the time the non-player characters) or the Public.<br/><br/>The player who is the Designer, choose from the eyes of Actors who is telling the story and then tells freely until the target, "Tom catches Jerry, you put a big gag, eats it with one gulp and then put to rest in his bed happy!" the Manufacturer can create a conflict and tells what happens according to him: "Tom grabs jerry, but it excape from his hand giving him a kick on the nose. So grab a sausage from the table before runngin into his hole."<br/><br/>In this case we use normal Skill level is: Newbie. You roll the dice (2D6) and based on the success several things happen: <br/><b>if there is a total success</b> of the Designer spends his description! (8 and up)<br/><b>If there is a total failure</b> passes the description of the Manufacture! (2 to 4)<br/><b>if there is a partial success</b> every person in the Public give a variation in the scene and the Designer must choose one. (5 to 7)<br/><br/>After the first conflict another player can be the Designer of the scene(entitled the player who was making producer), then change who is the Producer and the public (in rotation).  So in turn, each player will become Designer, Manufacturer or will be part of the public (the public can create conflicts when they like a description given by the Designer).<br/><br/><b>The goal is to create a funny story,</b> you do not win or lose and the system helps you to do it! Very easy! Especially since the story created with the contribution of all the players, it is much easier to create a really funny story like the one I show below (the result of a game with my friends). I hope you understand! But I assure you that it was really fun!<br/><br/><br/>Actual Play: <br/><b>Actors:</b> Tom, Jerry and Aunt May.  <b>Scenario:</b> They are found in the house of Aunt May. <br/>Objective: Jerry wants to eat the cheese in the fridge  but Tom knew that the mouse would have tried and so he placed his bed in front of the door!<br/><br/>Jerry runs into the kitchen, sees Tom in front of the refrigerator door, pulls out from behind his back a cane fishing (the player have used I have it), spear fishing line but accidentally hits a vessel wakes Tom (this was a partial success, Jerry wanted to use the cane fishing to grab the doghouse Tom and away from the refrigerator without waking him, but it went wrong! LOL).<br/><br/>[A player took possession of the scene, has become the Drawer, select the protagonist: Tom] Tom takes to chase Jerry slamming the dishes, TISH TISH finquando can not take it! (complete success!)<br/><br/>Tom leads  Jerry into the kitchen,  prepares a sandwich, Jerry puts inside and filling it with mustard (Constraint: Tom can not eat Jerry).<br/><br/>He goes to bite but Jerry is fired from the sandwich because it slides on the mustard! Tom can readily grasp it with the other hand.<br/><br/>[A player from the Public asks to enter another character, everyone accepts] <br/>Right now, however, comes Aunt May! Who sees the mess in the kitchen and starts to hit Tom with Broom, grabs him by the tail and throws him out the door! THE END!<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401050/#Comment_401050" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T06:29:45+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  6:29AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2012 8:27AM by vasquas.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Hans_c-o:  What does mean "The Dip"?

Paper and PDF Version? Whereas I think at least(minimal price) $ 6 dollars PDF and $ 6 plus print cost for the paper edition (otherwise recover the costs of production is impossibile), but in this case I would need 90 copies sold. I do not know if it's worth, for me the game is very good, if I could make a demo hangout there I would also try now (but unfortunately with my English especially in this game where the language is all about, is impossible). <br/><br/>Keep in touch however, I would like to send you (User Clone, Neko, Hans) the manual if I decide 100% to translate in this way, maybe you can help me... but before investing, I want to know if you think it is an achievable goal, otherwise I would not translate it!<br/><br/>A big greeting from italy!<br/>That's all Folks!^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401205/#Comment_401205" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-18T18:08:04+00:00" title="December 18, 2012  6:08PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401395/#Comment_401395" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-21T05:36:20+00:00" title="December 21, 2012  5:36AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good News!!!! <br/><br/>The English edition of Cartooner will be handled by Rafu (Raffaele Manzo), the illustrations are by Chiara Pedrini (professional graphics), I'm already looking at the first ArtWork are hilarious!!!<br/><br/>Cartooner will hope to start in February 2013 in Italian and English!
