The advice in the game is great, but also very trad (please insert your own definition of this rather than debate its meaning here), and I suspect Eppy would write the play advice and GM guidelines quite differently if he were doing it now.<br/><br/>So, what do you all have? What nifty indie techniques work well with this game? What do I need to do with player questionnaires that isn't in the rules? Are there things I need to avoid? Are there things in the book that I should avoid?<br/><br/>Teach, advise, comment, please.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294199/#Comment_294199" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-21T14:02:05+00:00" title="September 21, 2010  2:02PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'd suggest taking a quick look at this thread: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13036" rel="nofollow">Dungeons and Dread</a>.

Each time a player dies (the tower falls or they knock it over), their character dies.  The catch is that they then get to play one of the children that's been rescued.  It makes it super cool, then, to sacrifice yourself to save a child by knocking over the tower (there won't be a child to save if you die without saving one).  This also keeps all the players in the game the whole time.  Keep playing until there is only one adult left.  (This is when you pass all the other players a note to let them know about how hungry they are and how tasty the remaining adult looks <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/>:)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer" title="worldnamer"><img alt="worldnamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/60/224926835_32ff7cf58d_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer">worldnamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294213/#Comment_294213" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-21T17:14:15+00:00" title="September 21, 2010  5:14PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooph, well, there's a ton.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're making your own scenario, the questionaires will be the hardest part. There are guidelines for how to make them, but in reality I found bits and pieces to be more helpful than the whole. Remember that the questionnaires are not just so that you know what characters are in your game, but to allow the players a discovery process as well. I generally tell my players to read and answer questions in order, so that later questions have the surprise mental effects you're looking for. Definitely include something the characters can do well and something the characters care about. Don't drown out the characters with misery.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor narrative techniques, you want to think like a film-maker. It can be helpful to imagine each scene in the scenario and what you want to get out of the scene. Preparation is essential here. Usually when I look at a scenario, I call out a few key scenes and think about what I want the players to feel in that scene, and construct ways they might enter or leave it. Ex. If the scene is a preparatory one at the beginning, you may want a sense of foreboding, so you should figure out how to insert a dramatic element like a recurring color or visual item that signifies danger. Or perhaps you want it to seem light-hearted, so you have it happen during a summer day. Cheap tricks count for a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you actually play the game, I recommend you not have bright overhead light. Soft-focus uplighting in middle tones work best. It's not critical, but it can enhance the intimacy of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember that the tower is owned by the players. It's best if the players sit surrounding the tower and the GM is running the game from outside that circle. That casts you as the guide, and the tower as the antagonist. If you can hack it, it's best if you stand. Even if you start with a full complement, it's better to have the players tension the tower. Generally I tell the players how many pulls to make at the beginning and let them decide who will make the pulls. Watch who doesn't make pulls - those people are more likely to be unwilling to pull, so each pull they make will be more tense for them than some of the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nPractice with your tower. Get to know its dynamics. Each set of Jenga has its own touch, and you need to be able to read a tower from a distance, possibly in less-than-optimal lighting. Watch as the players make their pulls. If the tower is swaying a lot when they pull, there's danger. Make sure the scenes match the tension of the tower. Narratively, it's really best if there's an omnipresent horror that can strike at any time. Otherwise, it can be difficult if someone knocks over the tower when nothing is going on. Always be aware of how you could kill someone in a scene. (But Dead Man Walking has its benefits.)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with your game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus" title="Linnaeus"><img alt="Linnaeus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.rushcomm.ca/~gcam/Guernica Bull.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294272/#Comment_294272" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T08:50:24+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  8:50AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, guys.
