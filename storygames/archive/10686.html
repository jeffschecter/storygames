And to some extent, frustrated authors do make up a part of RPG's existing audience.<br/><br/>Why not fully embrace them? <br/><br/>It's easy to write for yourself or self publish. But without an audience it's hard to find that thrill of validation. RPGs can provide a captivated audience. <br/><br/>Maybe it's because I live in NYC but it seems RPGs attract a lot of people who want a creative outlet and have interests in other media but for whatever reason can't break in, so RPGs help them get their fix. <br/><br/>It's a naturally occurring fit. When looking for an audience, it's easier to go with the flow rather than against it. Maybe this is an opportunity? And the whole frustrated author as railroading GM becomes less of an issue in games with distributed authority.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237010/#Comment_237010" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T10:47:31+00:00" title="October 12, 2009 10:47AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because fanfic is free?<br/><br/>I think there are specific creative strengths and requirements that RPGs come with.

I've played some fantastic Cthulhu scenarios where the Keeper has essentially designed a world and you're playing in it. It's a great feeling. Done right, you both feel part of the story and as though you're playing through the GM's story.<br/><br/>There should much more of this. I remember that Acts Of Evil GMs are actually encouraged to research the various milieus in which the game takes place. In a similar way, I'd love to see GMs encouraged to flesh out their settings. For example, it'd be nice to have Dogs GMs designing how their town looks and sounds, together with some of the main buildings, so it feels like a real place. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I tried embracing a frustrated author at GenCon and she hit me.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237017/#Comment_237017" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T11:13:37+00:00" title="October 12, 2009 11:13AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't the frustrated author only severely annoying when they're trying to run a lengthy or even open-ended campaign?<br/><br/>For a one-shot, I'm willing to experiment quite a bit and play-along, personally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237018/#Comment_237018" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T11:14:52+00:00" title="October 12, 2009 11:14AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2009 11:16AM by DanMaruschak.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm an as-of-yet-unpublished novelist, and this is part of the market I hope to hit with <a href="http://dansdesigns.wordpress.com/2009/10/06/final-hour-of-a-storied-age-new-title/" rel="nofollow">the game I'm developing</a>, which I'm trying to design from a fiction-writing perspective.

The cliche is the guy who's got this whole vast story already finished in his head, and wants an audience. That guy? He's poison.<br/><br/>The original post, though, at least points to a much larger - and less problematic - group: creative people who aren't serious about it. I'm one.<br/><br/>I have lots of ideas. Most of them suck. And I certainly don't have any real urge to devote myself to polishing, finishing, elaborating, and making them into a finished creative product that might or might not ever find an audience or objectively be any good. I'm not an artist, or an author (of anything other than tongue-in-cheek fanfic and the occasional bit of pr0n). I just like being creative and sharing my ideas.<br/><br/>I would bet that there are an awful lot of people who fit into that category who would really benefit from the "permission to suck" that a good gaming group can give to its members' creativity. You don't have to finish your work - you can throw out your ideas, and somebody else will use them if they like them. And if they don't they'll hit the floor and it'll be done.<br/><br/>The key here, though, is: you have to be willing to suck. You have to be willing to put your ideas out there and have them fall flat. You also need to be willing to give as well as take - to incorporate everybody else's creativity into your own if you like it, and to be upfront about it if something doesn't work for you.<br/><br/>In my experience, that part is awfully tough for a lot of people in the "gamer" world, but not so much for amateur creatives. We've been sucking for a while, and we're comfortable with it by now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237029/#Comment_237029" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T12:26:43+00:00" title="October 12, 2009 12:26PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, random thoughts. <br/><br/>The first is that I agree with Luke. Writing != GMing. <br/><br/>Now, there are a lot of crossovers in skill. A lot of the things that make me a good writer make me a good GM. And a lot of weaknesses in my writing are also weaknesses in my GMing. But in the end if I'm in a mood to write and I try to GM, it goes badly. And if I'm in a mood to GM and I try to write, it goes badly. The two things are not the same, and a great deal of shit fanfic and shit games have been caused by people's inability to separate the activities. <br/><br/>The second is that I agree with Graham. A GM who has skills in setting and character creation, who is capable of building atmosphere and mood, is an amazing thing. And much as it isn't the same as writing, there are a lot of individual skills that you can pick up, cross over, or get trained in if there is more cross-pollination with writers. (Much like how RPGing is not Improv, but there has been a lot of good brought to RPGing by Improv.) <br/><br/>The third thing is I agree with Mark. In every Fame type movie you'll ever see, in every Improv book, in every writers workshop, there will be a part where you're told (or the hero of the story is told) that they have to get over themselves if they want to create. You have to be willing to look like a fool, to get past being laughed at and judged, or you aren't going anywhere interesting. I think the lack of ability to do this explains a lot of the prickliness in our community about criticism. However, I don't know that its any better in various other creative communities. Most of them I've ever been involved in suck about it just as much as we do. <br/><br/>All of which brings me back to this point in the OP: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>RPGs attract a lot of people who want a creative outlet and have interests in other media but for whatever reason can't break in, so RPGs help them get their fix.</blockquote>\nI do not judge others for their creative outlets. However, for me I cannot imagine a more sure and certain way to destroy both my own joy and both my RPGing and my writing than to try to get my writing urges out through RPGing. I have done this in the past, and every time I have done it the result has been me being miserable as a creative person, shitty as an RPGer, and hollow as a writer. For me, it is death to try to bait and switch my creative needs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237030/#Comment_237030" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T12:31:16+00:00" title="October 12, 2009 12:31PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking as a frustrated author, I'd love to be embraced <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/>I need more hugs<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237046/#Comment_237046" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T14:13:54+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  2:13PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Brand said, and double what Luke said.  As a writer with an upcoming novel publication, several shorts in print, and an upcoming published comic, I struggle with GM-ing, less because I try to push out "my" story (I don't), and more because the varied skills of what I consider a good GM are hard to combine.  For starters, there's a lot less improv in writing, and a lot more editing and rewriting.  Note that I'm talking about actual play here, not writing a game.<br/><br/>I imagine my writing skills do offer some useful insights regarding characters, stakes, and identification of conflict possibilities.  Sometimes I'm even able to implement those insights at the table.  I'm also pretty good at dialogue and description.

Nor am I suggesting to make RPGs produce award winning literature (although that\u2019s a seductive design goal up there with systems that can produce excellent roleplaying without skill or practice, I think there is a lot that can be learned from trying and I never want to say never).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are a lot of people out there who hunger for creative outlets. The have lots of ideas, many of them could suck, but they feel this constant itch they don\u2019t seem to be able to scratch. I suspect many people think writing is the solution. It\u2019s an obvious and accessible solution. But the prospect of devoting the time involved is intimidating. Many people don\u2019t do it. I bet some suspect writing is not the answer and don\u2019t do it out of fear of realizing that truth. But they still feel that itch. So people get stuck in this perpetual cycle of frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nRPGs might be a quick and cheap solution. I don\u2019t think the itch is always the desire to write. But rather a desire to explore and share ideas or creatively express one self. RPGs could even appeal to actual writers as an entertainment activity or exercise in exploring character + situation and group brainstorming rather than a writing substitute.<br/>\n<br/>\nI completely agree that writing skills don\u2019t equal roleplaying skills. Just like improv theater doesn\u2019t equal roleplaying. But there are varying degrees of overlap. Further, the skills required to play one roleplaying game doesn\u2019t equal the skills required to play another roleplaying game. D&amp;D; 4E\u2019s skills don\u2019t equal Prime Time Adventures skills or a Vampire LARP skills. There is definitely overlap. Different problems need different solutions. And all those different solutions can all be RPGs but still be very different. The solution here might be another different RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, some people should really just write. And I wouldn\u2019t recommend this approach as a bait and switch tactic. But a lot of people don\u2019t really know what they want till they try it. And RPGs might be the answer they never considered.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bring this up because we\u2019ve been talking about marketing and audiences. This is an audience that comes up frequently. Maybe it comes up for a reason that isn\u2019t completely negative. Maybe it is an opportunity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_237337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237337/#Comment_237337" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T23:42:14+00:00" title="October 13, 2009 11:42PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>... it seems RPGs attract a lot of people who want a creative outlet and have interests in other media but for whatever reason can't break in, so RPGs help them get their fix.<br><br>...Maybe this is an opportunity?</br></br></blockquote>Of course!

Not just writing, but snippets of acting, and comedy, and visual art, and ( in the case of minis fans like myself) hobby/craft stuff.<br><br>For myself, I don't really feel any great urge to seriously pursue any of that stuff. Certainly not at the level of going professional, and not even at the level of skilled amateur. More like, noodling around a bit.<br><br>If I get what you're saying John, there's a lot f folks out in the world like that. I hope you're saying that anyway.<br><br>A couple of thoughts.<br><br>We're awfully elite<br/>Gamers that hang around boards like this or who pay pretty regularly or even who just read a lot of gamer books have a much different level of know-how when it comes to gaming, and that's kinda a a barrier for new folks. I don't believe anyone sets out to create that barrier, but it's there. When it comes down to it, roleplaying and storygames and related hobbies are nothing put Plaqy Pretend with some restrictions added. It might help to look at it in those terms if we want new blood.<br/><br/>Time is limited for everybody<br/>Except the core RPG audience of pre-driving asge teens and undergrads, of course. Those folks have snotloads of time, relatively speaking. Check out the thread on how long people's game sessions tend to run these days and see what the responses are. If 2-3 hours of game play is the norm, we might want to think about making games that match that reality. We might also want to consider for other folks new to the thing that even those numbers would be considered high. OTOH, what about "event" games? That seems left to the realm of one-off parlor LARPs and Murder Mystery boxed sets. What could be done under that model?<br/><br/>Group Creation versus Single Vision versus various combos of the two<br/>I like a lot of dirty-hippy games that have some kind of group situation generation. I think it's very cool in terms of getting everyone involved. Howevere, there's really something to say positively about the older Single Unifying Vision style of play, where a GM basically tells interested parties what's up in the coming play. What intermediate combos are possible?<br/><br/>On a related note, I sometimes find that the group barainstorming part is awfully cool, but also taqkes easily a whole session requiring the group to be together. This may not work as well if the group on Brainstorming Day can't actually be easily reconstituted for play.<br/><br/>A hybrid concept I've been noodling with involves a Brainstorming party seperate from play. If it works, the concept would be for several underbaked ideas to be group created. Then, some number of those said underbaked ideas are picked up by different players to develop into a workable one-shot event game to be played at a later date. No clue if it would work or not, but I'm hopeful.<br/><br/>Rewarding out of game creativity<br/>How? I dunno. It seems to me like the flipside of not attempting to punish unwanted behavior with in-fiction penalties. You want to encourage folks who blue-book or do other snippets of fiction or art, but is in-game reward really the best path? Is it even the best reward? Is there some other form of social recognition that would be better? I'm inclined to encourage bad "let me tell you about my character/game" blabbering in some form, like a potluck dinner or bbq event. Hell, why not encourage people show off that stuff occasionally? Maybe it can be a non-costume costume party; Everyone gets a sticky name tage on which they can write the name of any character they've enjoyed playing since the last potluck and stick that to themself. Then they can ad-lib as their character off-and-on as the party goes on.<br/><br/>Creative connectivity and audience<br/>I guess that the core of what I'm getting at is that it's the connections built in this hobby that are really relevent to the thing, not the rules or even the skill. It's encouraging the fun interactions while being creative that matter vastly more than the mechanics, so it's important to make it easy and enjoyable to get that social aspect up and going.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237485/#Comment_237485" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T12:34:17+00:00" title="October 14, 2009 12:34PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Group Creation versus Single Vision versus various combos of the two<br/>I like a lot of dirty-hippy games that have some kind of group situation generation.

The stereotypical railroady GM has complete control over some aspects (like setting) but is supposed to have no control over others (like character choices) but can't mentally bridge that differential, possibly because they intuitively know that they all need to work in concert for compelling fiction to happen. I think distributed authority games where all of the players can contribute to all aspects of the fiction (plot, character, setting, etc.) will work better for the proposed market. I also think that guided, constrained, collaborative creativity will be more effective than the "you won the roll, tell me a story!" end of the mechanical spectrum since crafting stories is something that writers tend to do in solitude, and may find intimidating to do when put on the spot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237493/#Comment_237493" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T12:55:18+00:00" title="October 14, 2009 12:55PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Writers who can\u2019t let go are going to have problems outside of RPGs as well.

I think it was Remi who made me realize that I'm not so much into roleplaying after all. :P<br/><br/>There's definitely a certain detachment I bring to most gaming and the characters I play. Not a disinterest, but a reluctance and discomfort with acting, speaking in-character or improv-ing. I still want to see where a character and a story goes, and guide those elements towards a conclusion with my friends. I'm just not so much interested in <i>being</i> that character <i>in</i> that story.<br/><br/>Realizing that about myself, I'm finally seeing the things in RPGs and story games that I really like, then decoupling that from the stuff I don't.<br/><br/>As Macklin edited an early draft of Do, he noted a marked difference between "story-playing," which is what usually happens in most RPGs and story games, and "story-telling," which is that detached perspective I usually bring as a player. Now I'm coming to terms with that perspective and just crossing my fingers, hoping that games <i>made</i> from that perspective will find an audience.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, to your comment, roleplaying is not writing, but that doesn't mean writing can't be a game. (At least, I hope so.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237523/#Comment_237523" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T13:54:58+00:00" title="October 14, 2009  1:54PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have anything to add, but I think this is a really interesting topic, and there's lots of good ideas in this thread I'll be coming back to reread later!
