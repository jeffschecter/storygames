The idea was to start a blog that, because the blog is likely to be a low profile, small audience kind of thing, could be used as a reactive setting and world game for FATE. Once a set amount of 'foundation' information was released, the setting could be thrown out for people to play, run campaigns, report back to me if they wanted, and have that incorporated in the living fiction of the game world. If two groups had campaigns that seemed to be heading to collide, I'd love to see if they wanted to get in touch with eachother and discuss doing weird things with how they ran their next session or three, maybe combining groups, or swapping character sheets.<br/>So similar to Das Schwarze Auge, but more reactive because it doesn't have a bajillion players.<br/><br/>I started this month. The idea is to write about 1000 words a week of various little bits of setting detail and mechanical stuff until it is in a runnable state, then to provide some kind of 'weekly round ups' in addition. It'll be hard to keep up, but I am hoping it works.<br/><br/>And now for the pitch of the game:<br/><a href="http://the-talinz-project.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/the-talinz-project-pitch-and-half.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://the-talinz-project.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/the-talinz-project-pitch-and-half.html</a><br/><br/>I'd love to hear people's comments on both the setting material as it comes out and what they think about the idea.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
