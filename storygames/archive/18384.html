But here and now, I just want to talk about the fun games.<br/><br/>Friday Night - <br/>I played a photographer / journalist / jaded activist in the summer of 1968 Chicago.  I soon met up with a laid back Jimmy Hendrix who was a PROPHET of music.  He did an amazing job of working in song lyrics, some of them hadn't even been written yet.  Jimmy was a man who could summon music from out-or-time.<br/>We had a simply amazing Hunter S. Thompson.  He had the mannerisms, the gestures, the timing, and he very nearly never broke character, except to bust Bill White's chops in good fun.<br/>Hillary Rhodam was plated by someone new to me (and new to Nerdly) who fit right in instantly.  A-Mazing sense of humor and capable of breaking through the character to get laughs with almost not effort.<br/>Gary Gygax, (pronounced G'Gax, the "y" is silent) was meticulous, focused, and simply great.  I think the highlight of the entire con for me might just be when he went to a separate table to solve a puzzle that Bill had handed his character, fake cigarette in hand, totally in character.<br/>We even had an observer who sat down with us, and when she saw how great everyone else was, she jumped in for a few scenes and really brought it, tossing in wisdom and healing words and getting in the spirit of the late sixties.<br/><br/>The game was hilarious, and I was easily outclassed by everyone there.  Thank you to all of you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414364/#Comment_414364" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-20T06:28:44+00:00" title="May 20, 2013  6:28AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Friday Midnight -<br/>Jason had a LARP planned for the Tower called Thola.  From what I understand, it was originally a table-top experience, that had been given a live-action spin for this event.<br/>It was pretty cool!  Many of the participants were still high off the energy of the game they had all just played together, and they pushed hard for grim choices.  Our Authority Figures were arbitrary and creul.<br/>The highlight here was probably my character's idiot brother.  He was an embarrassment, and always screwing things up, which is very dangerous in Thola.  I had the bright idea to send him off on very important CSU business, hoping (not so secretly) that he would mess it up and get himself killed.  But instead, he turned-coat and became one of their goons!<br/>I tried to get him in to trouble with the CSU, giving him bad advice, but he turned it back on me, and I was arrested!  Before I could be executed, a fire, some gunshots, and it was over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414366/#Comment_414366" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-20T06:36:08+00:00" title="May 20, 2013  6:36AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2013 6:48AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Saturday Afternoon -<br/>Carry, a game about war<br/>Our company was called early in the morning to make it in to Hue, as the Tet Offensive seized everything.  My character was always lost in his copy of Lord of the Rings, and this morning was no exception.  Our first struggle was between my character and one of his superiors, and I nearly lost my most precious pages to the mud.<br/>The highlight for me is probably using Subversive to countermand a retreat order.  I believed I was invincible, and that we needed to get to the airport and kill as many as we could.  I told the driver of the jeep to turn and hit the gas, despite his objections.  That was probably the breaking point, as from there, it was impossible to tell which orders we should follow and which we should ignore.  Eventually, our most veteran player drugged the Sergent in order to avoid another bad order.<br/>Almost all of Alpha and Bravo company were wiped out, and no territory was gained.

It was a fun game focused on 9 children as they move from 6 years old to 16 years old, and then a final reunion scene.  It was a super intense workshop first, where we talked about our own personal experiences with bullying, and then learned a little about dancing.  The best scene for me, I think, was when two of the kids were working on a Science Fair project together, and one of them started getting angry that the other hadn't provided enough materials to do the job.  But he hadn't contributed because he couldn't.  His parents were poor and we all knew it.<br/>So the rest of us were milling about nearby, talking about things, and our conversation eventually turned to the two students in conflict. We started just commenting on the fact that they were working together, but as they got more and more heated, we reacted with more gossip and inflammatory remarks, judging them both from a distance.<br/>The rich kid pushed and pushed and pushed too far, and then the dance-battle began.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414368/#Comment_414368" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-20T06:54:57+00:00" title="May 20, 2013  6:54AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2014 7:54AM by Harlequin.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sunday <br/>Puppetland<br/>We began this story not in Haven, as previous, but in PuppetTown.  I'll admit I drew from some of the abuse of power I saw and felt in earlier games, and Gentle Ben was ordered out of his house so it could be searched.  His things were destroyed, his house was accidentally burned down, and he himself was injured when he tried to appease the Nutcrackers.<br/>Two returning puppets saw Gentle Ben on the side of the mandatory Holiday Parade in Punch's honor, and quickly they knew he was a good puppet, and he must meet Judy and join their cause.<br/>They faced many trials on their way, Grief and Punch among them, and they faced many questions as well.  Gentle Ben had never been outside PuppetTown, and he had entirely different thoughts about things.  To him, the loss of Punch's Boys was bad, because Punch and the Boys had done a better job at many things than the incompetent and clumsy Nutcrackers, and PuppetTown seemed less orderly since the Boys were gone.<br/>When little Swampy Padfoot went to find a safe way out, he returned with two helpful puppets by his side that were working needles and crocheting a find web.  But they were spies!  They threw their beautiful net of yarn on Gentle Ben and pulled him to the ground.  Gentle Ben thought he could escape, but in doing so he would likely knock over the water tower which would dearly hurt Asha, as she was a Shadow Puppet and should never never get wet.<br/>Swampy began to bound on the spies, and soon they called out for help.  A terrible, dark shadow of a puppet came from the alley, and he was more scary than any of the Boys and perhaps more than Punch himself, though no one would admit that.  This terrible puppet ate the spies in one gulp, gobbling them up, and began to slurp the yarn, pulling Gentle Ben closer and closer to his mouth!<br/>Asha called out to him, and for a moment the terrible puppet seemed to remember her, but then he only remembered how she tasted, and wanted to eat her instead!  Gentle Ben stood and pulled the terrible puppet away from Asha, and Gentle Ben uprooted the water tower and pushed it into the terrible puppet's mouth.  The terrible puppet swole to the size of the tower, and his eyes began to glow hotly, and the puppets could hear the water tower cracking and popping and giving way, and so they ran far far away from the terrible puppet, who they could almost still remember as their friend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414369/#Comment_414369" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-20T06:55:56+00:00" title="May 20, 2013  6:55AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I add mine or is this the Harlequin show? Oh well, here goes. <i>Sagas of the Icelanders.</i><br/><br/>Drengur, Go\xf0i of Reykh\xf3lar, has his hands full with his sorcerous wife Oddr\xfan and four children, each troublesome in their own way.<br/><br/>His eldest, \xd6gri, is actually fostered from a powerful rival. He's huscarl and keeper of the peace. For any harm to come to him would be a diplomatic calamity.<br/><br/>His daughter Halla is an opportunistic schemer married to a wealthy thug named G\xedsli Greyback. She's also got a little something-something on the side.<br/><br/>His son \xdeeyr is a loud-mouthed dick engaged to be married to the daughter of Magni, a neighboring Go\xf0i. It'd be a great match if L\xe1ra wasn't a Shield Maiden chosen by the gods and utterly uninterested in being this tool's wife.<br/><br/>And his little son \xcdsar just wants to be a man and have manly adventures. The household is evenly divided as to whether that's a good idea, him being 12 and all, on the cusp of adulthood.<br/><br/>And then there's this monster named Skrimsl, who lives on a predictably lonely island called \xc6\xf0aklettar, and Skrimsl is widely known to be an unkillable, tricky beast. It killed L\xe1ra's mother and set her on her path, long ago. \xdeeyr decides to go kill this unkillable beast and take along his little brother. This Drengar cannot allow. The kid sneaks onto the boat anyway.<br/><br/>By the time Oddr\xfan's grim visions come to fruition L\xe1ra is dead and Halla has lost both husband and lover. \xd6gri is maimed and poor little \xcdsar has been changed by what he's seen among the stinking seal rookeries of \xc6\xf0aklettar.<br/><br/>And the unkillable monster? Still unkilled after slaying two generations of Skjaldmey.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414370/#Comment_414370" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-20T07:02:07+00:00" title="May 20, 2013  7:02AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What was the game from that Friday night session with Gygax and Jimmy Hendrix?

Which was super-cool.  Instead of trying to get everyone on the same story-line (in the same "party") we deliberately made mostly unconnected tales, and let the City of Itra connect them for us.<br/>And we didn't have scenes!  We tried our hardest to have cameras transition from element to element, and let those take us along for the ride.  In one, we followed the water stream from a melting ice-block along the road to the boot that just stepped in it.  In another, we zoomed in tight on a clock, so tight that we don't notice the scenery has changed, then we zoom back out to find we're in a different room, a different day.<br/><br/>So much good stuff here, but it was a flurry and difficult to type all out.  Sticking out is a Futurist realizing her dream of inventing a street car, only to accidentally give it life.  A young girl who doesn't feel like she belongs being torn, wanting to leave on a newly invented sentient street car, but not wanting to abandon hope of catching the handsome Dillan's eye.  A giraffe who found himself a human in the City of Itra being cruelly locked in a cage with an actual giraffe, and finally finding human garments that fit, but watching his giraffe friend suddenly become human as well.  A house of a man finally realizing that the house he thought he lost was himself at last.<br/><br/>So much!  So good!  But so short, being the last game on Sunday, and we didn't get to finish as much as I'd like.

The Pilot and Geologist are not at all confident they can get off the planet without her but they don't have much choice.<br/><br/>On the way back to the ship (playing at camp, we had the delicious luxury of setting them very far apart) Pilot and Geologist are separated.

They wreck the bridge.<br/><br/>The ship is never leaving. Phases three and four? The arrival of Tomes? Not so much.<br/><br/>So that was a surprising derailment! I think James was as pleased as I was at this weird development and we rolled with it easily. The Pilot detonated the ship's reactor as a distress beacon.

I'd run it twice before Camp Nerdly. Both previous times, I did not forget the lovingly created character sheets. Ahem.<br/><br/>So there was a couple minutes of stark panic. I had a table of seven players who had given up being in other awesome games to play in mine, and I didn't have the goddamned character sheets. I did have the one-page cast of characters with little blurbs about each one. I had my memory of the personalities and special powers. <br/><br/>We did the simplest 13th Age chargen ever (no time to do a full-blown 3rd level chargen for seven players):<br/><br/>* Six ability scores (Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha). Scores rated from +4 down to -1, arranged as you like.<br/>* 8 skill points over 2-3 different backgrounds. <br/>* One unique thing -- the special power each character gets.<br/>* Equipment as needed.<br/>* A reminder that the cleric and wizard could cast freeform ritual magic.<br/><br/>I let them know that we could still have a roaring fun mystery adventure but that we could not have any kind of combat, since all of the hard chargen stuff is setting up combat powers. We'd use a lot of skill checks and my ad lib ritual magic system and lots of player smarts.<br/><br/>We had a blast. As I had hoped, having more of the eight pregens (all related by blood or marriage) played meant more fodder for interpersonal role-playing. There were discussions about noble succession, about not cutting out mom's eyes for ritual components, about free will and human sacrifice. There was a winnowing of suspects based on means, motive, and opportunity. At the end of the four hours, there were a few different suspects and I asked everyone to name their most likely suspect. One player got it right, but the bait scheme they'd set up (and rolled well for) would prove it out, in any case. Any other 13th Age game would have ended in a righteous boss fight and that would have been hella fun, but I think the players still had a great time. A couple told me that it was not only fine, but perhaps better for not having all the combat stuff (really, I only planned one encounter for the end). I'm not sure that that isn't an indictment of the 13th Age rules, or if it just says something about the preferences of this player group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414380/#Comment_414380" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-20T09:08:01+00:00" title="May 20, 2013  9:08AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got to play My Life With Master from the player side. See, I've run this game over a dozen times but have never experienced it as a minion. Sean did a great job running it and twisting the knife in our hearts.<br/><br/>Our Master was a Gothic barber / dentist who was collecting the perfect set of teeth to impress his mother. I played an enforcer who felt no pain (except dental pain, naturally) and was an utter weakling unless jacked up on cocaine. His cocaine habit made him totally dependent on the evil Doctor. I did some terrible things, of course, before our group of pitiful minions were able to make enough connections to townspeople to overcome our own self-loathing and weariness. One of the minions was Captured. Another triggered the Horror Revealed. In the end, it was I who triggered End Game but I did not have the will to live on after we killed the Doctor. My enforcer filled himself with cocaine and overdosed. The others integrated with society.<br/><br/>Rachael played a brilliant "James," a man whose deformed palate made it impossible for him to speak intelligibly unless wearing a special mouthpiece that the Doctor would give him when there was a task to do. A weaker player would have come off comical. James was portrayed with deep affection and humility, and I think all of us fell in love with his weakness and strength. I teared up when the Doctor crushed James' mouthpiece in his hand as punishment for failure. <br/><br/>There were plenty of other moments that elicited gasps and groans and facepalms as we were forced to do awful things, or awful things were done to us. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414381/#Comment_414381" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-20T09:14:23+00:00" title="May 20, 2013  9:14AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Truth in the Maroons scenario, which is utterly brilliant and I think in the top three of my gaming experiences, ever.

It's quick, it's evocative, it's got an untenable situation, and it's going to end in rivers in blood. The trick of the game is that it really gets you thinking things are going to go your way, you just need to do X...oh, why is there a blade sticking through my body? I played Thorvald, the patriarch, and had a wonderful wife in Fulla, played by Kelley. She just rocked the hell out of that role, and it was easy to play a figurehead, prone to overreaction. Her desperate confession, my rejection and pushing away of her in rage and a desperate attempt to save face, and then her death in my arms: intense, great.<br/><br/><i>Doubt</i> was one of my favorite roleplaying experiences, period. First time I really got bleed, and we just had such a tight group of players.

I'm glad folks enjoyed it.<br/>Things that stuck with me.<br/><br/>The elven thief wore a half face mask for most of his carrer, as a consequence of the dwarf reliably turning him in to the magistrate in most of the towns they visited.<br/><br/>The dwarf completely failing his defy danger role to enter the cave of the abyssal dragon, and trying to pawn it off as stalwartly guarding the rear.<br/><br/>The ranger loosing his arm in combat with a dragon, not to the dragon, but to a failure on his part, and a mixed success of the dwarf.  The dice really supported the fiction there..<br/><br/>The druid, after taking in the demon that was previously bound to his love (to save said love), having random body parts shapeshift.  As the demon tried to figure out how to sort of drive his new host.<br/><br/>I mentioned the Red Desert as a map piece , and in about 30 seconds the players had come up with pirates in steampunk barge ships mining red iron.  And the ships were fueled by magic so hot they left glass tracks in the sand.
