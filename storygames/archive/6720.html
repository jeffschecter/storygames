At an earlier stage in my GMing career, I often tried to use the "choose your own adventure" structure as an inspiration when writing adventures, for any system.<br><br>"OK, if the PCs decide to board the derelict space station, then X will happen; if they land on the nearby planet, then Y will happen instead".<br/><br/>I quickly discovered two things:<br/>1. Writing down all these if-thens is an incredibly huge amount of work for the GM.  If the PCs make ten decisions over the course of the adventure, and each decision is between two options, then if there are no repeats, simple math says there are 1024 possible endings.  And ten decision points with two options each is too *simple* of an adventure to be really interesting.<br/><br/>Besides, they're only going to see one ending, so the other 1023 will be wasted effort.  The cool thing about a CYOA book is you can read it multiple times and get different outcomes.  It's very rare for an RPG group to play the same adventure more than once, so why write it that way?<br/><br/>2. No matter how well you think you've enumerated all the possible courses of action, the players will ALWAYS do something else.  Board the derelict space station or land on the nearby planet?  Ha!  The PCs will want to use the space station as photon-torpedo target practice and then siphon off the planet's entire atmosphere to sell to the Spaceballs on the opposite side of the galaxy.<br/><br/>No matter how smart or creative you think you are, your players will surprise you every time.  There's no way you can anticpate what they'll want to do because, for one thing, they simply outnumber you.<br/><br/>So, I finally decided to abandon the CYOA model for RPG adventures and become more of an improviser.  The reason a tabletop RPG can be way more fun than a CYOA book or a computer game is that the tabletop RPG is the only one that can be driven by human creativity in real-time.  If you get good at coming up with interesting stuff on the fly (which I don't claim to be good at yet, but I'm working on it), then you can take advantage of this.  If you're improvising, then there's no time wasted coming up with plot threads the players won't see, no getting stuck when the players want to try something different, and best of all, the story you create is influence by everyone's creativity, not just the GM's.<br/><br/>I'm a lot happier since I embraced the improvisation.  But that's not neccessarily the right thing for everybody.  What is it that you like about CYOA that you want to see happen in your games?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149089/#Comment_149089" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T14:31:39+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  2:31PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rafial</cite>Action Castle!</blockquote>\nI thought this was a scenario for Parsley?

Choose Your Own Adventure is a very simple system.  It's really just a binary set of options (although there might have been times when there were three or more choices, I only remember there being two choices).  In one way of looking at it, almost all systems can do this already. In fact, you don't even need a game except to tell a player what's going on (including the actions of their character) until some juncture, present them with multiple choice options.  Looking at it another way, no system does this because players usually have many more options (and in most story games, they have the power to shape the world and influence the story, taking it in directions no one planned for ahead of time). Which is completely different than a branching novel.<br/><br/>I think just about any game could be written into a CYOA book form, after playing it, but there'd still be a lot of work filling out the paths not travelled. I'd say that CYOA is fundamentally solo, where the reader chooses branches (and I think most of us had a finger or two in place so we could back track and see what the other choice might have been - especially if a path leads to the main character's death). And that it takes a page from the novel, and presents the reader with such limited options, that it is its own system, best not to convert it.<br/><br/>So I'm not just negative, here's some brainstorming.  The way that I'd go about developing a CYOA system is perhaps something where all the players are controlling the protagonist, and if they disagree about a direction, then you branch the story, taking it in multiple directions. For a system, I'd probably want something like playing cards, or even Once Upon a Time cards, to give some guidance for the story (because improvising a story with very little input from others is hard). Although maybe this works best as a party game. If the teller gets confused, or lost in the story, then it changes to a new teller and the game continues. <br/><br/>But I dunno, maybe Once Upon A Time is the closest match, because I keep thinking that I'd rather play that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149109/#Comment_149109" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T15:23:42+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  3:23PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            fnord3125: true, it is a text adventure.

It might not work too well in a proper game but if the players take a path and later want to explore the other option, you could turn back time and go for it.

I might be looking back more fondly on it than I should, cos I never actually played it, but it mimiced the simple FF game system and looked like it would work. I guess at the time that low-magic rules-lite systems were quite rare, and a lot of the goodness was from an established background and setting that you recognised from the FF books. There were a few supplements, Titan (a world guide), some sorta MM, and Blacksand, a city sourcebook which had lots of extra rules.

Sure I had a character, but they had little ability to impact the events occurring around them, such that if there was a preplanned scene one, two, and three, there was nothing they could do to prevent scene one from leading into scene two from leading into scene three, and the end result will be the same regardless of who is playing or how they play (much like how the ending of the movie is the same regardless of who is watching). And, to be fair, I have friends who love this, being manoeuvred from scene to scene until they get to discover the GM's twist ending, and at the end they all cheer. <br/><br/>However, a CYOA is not like a movie. There are set possible endings, but there is no set ending. Scene one might not lead to scene two but a different scene instead. Which to me feels a lot like bangs. Like, hey we just hit a cool choice for you to make, make it, and we'll see where it leads. Bangs are not binary (I mean, I suppose they could be, but they aren't by definition binary), but they have that same aspect where upon your choice matters, and it impacts the story.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151134/#Comment_151134" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T23:56:11+00:00" title="June 16, 2008 11:56PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I think would be fun would be a system that mimicked "cheating" at CYOA -- keeping your finger between the pages at the decision point so you could flip back in a hurry if you didn't get a result you liked.

They range from the simple (Dungeoneer), to the more complex (Dragon Warriors) all the way to the downright insane (Maelstrom). A lot of them just focussed on replicating the rules system and setting of the adventure books but some, like Dungeoneer, certainly did try to capture some of the feel of the books as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153289/#Comment_153289" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T22:19:19+00:00" title="June 26, 2008 10:19PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked those old CYOA books, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could always draw out a binary tree as a kind of game board and have players move their pawns along it, having each section be defined when players come to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wanted, you could throw in some stakes setting rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you could do like Ron suggests a few post up and play it in reverse. Have the players start at the spread-out end of the binary tree (one of the endings) and describe that ending (presumably a bad one) and then move their pawns (or dice, perhaps, that rotate to show a change in score and potential) as the players move either toward the head of the tree (the not-yet-created beginning of the story) or back towards the endings (defining the choices they made to get to one ending the first time and then creating a second choice to move toward a different ending.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game ends when all the possible endings are mapped out or when the players find a mutually satisfying one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153315/#Comment_153315" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T01:45:09+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  1:45AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've sometimes toyed with the idea of dragging out my old <i>Fighting Fantasy</i> gamebooks and running them for a group.

WHY would it need extra work?<br/><br/>If you found the solo handbook boring to begin with, fair enough. But if you found the solo book interesting to play, and your with people who are of a similar disposition, why does the group version need any extra work or handwaving?<br/><br/>Edit: I found the review using google: <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9324.phtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9324.phtml</a><br/>Frankly it doesn't sound like he enjoyed the solo game book.
