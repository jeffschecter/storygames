It sounds like it should be so rich since all those things happened back then. BUT it isn't so straight forward as it seems. Counter-culture happenings were largely plotless. No three act story archs here. There are certainly 60's stories that could be done, war stories (The Green Beret's), crime stories (The French Connection), spy stories (James Bond) but not so much hippie or rock stories. <br/><br/>I can definitely see 60's games being done with Fiasco (is there a Fiasco Mad Men or a Fiasco Hair) situations where bad shit seems aking to happen, but what about sex drugs and Rock-n-Roll where sweatness and light happens? Fiasco 60's Idealism doesn't sound right. <br/><br/>My ideas on how to do this are <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1743621402/snapshot-1969-a-far-out-story-telling-card-game" rel="nofollow">here</a><br/><br/>What are your thoughts?<br/><br/>Imagine how it could be done with miniatures!<br/><br/>Chris Engle                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382472/#Comment_382472" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T15:49:07+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  3:49PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2012 3:49PM by Arpie.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think that Abbey Hoffman would argue that 60s counter-culture happenings were far from plotless, as would Martin Luther King and Malcom X. Events like the Free Store, the Freedom Rides and, heck, even love-ins were organized with specific goals in mind - war protests, raising social awareness of institutionalized inequality, environmental concerns.<br/><br/>The media often portrays hippies as blissed-out children, blinded by their own naivety. And sometimes they were. Sometimes, like certain modern political movements, drifters and members of the indigent population filled out the crowds. But the mythical events had rhyme and reason. Each one had a specific injustice or difficulty it wanted to overcome or an alternate lifestyle it wanted to demonstrate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382474/#Comment_382474" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T16:20:30+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  4:20PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have thought for a while that <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12246/up-against-the-wall-motherer" rel="nofollow">this</a> would make a great setting for 3:16.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382475/#Comment_382475" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T16:21:26+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  4:21PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We did a Sixties <i>Society of Dreamers</i> once.

I was 6 so none of it really made any sense. Since most gamers are younger than me I figured that getting too historical wouldn't work - people usually don't know history. At the same time I want people to be able to explore that side as well as the naive drugged out stuff. Right now I'm taking a slice of life apporach.<br/><br/>The game follows a "hero" through five scenes. Each scene is started by a card with a picture on it. They link the scenes together when they tell the story. At the end of each scene the player who came up with the most entertaining bit wins the card. <br/><br/>At Origins we had some cool games. An older couple ran a 39 year old woman through an adventure in Detroit complete with a drug dealing ambulance driver and a drug deal gone bad. Another game followed a senator's son in a closeted gay road to the Stonewall Uprising. There were a lot of 19 year old girls and drugs. Each game seemed to get at a small piece of that person's life that was fun to make up but didn't have a plot. <br/><br/>The Up against the wall... game definitely gets at the politics more. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382492/#Comment_382492" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T19:43:06+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  7:43PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that makes it a retrospective game all right.

Most of them involve encouraging the players not to drive towards conflicts or solutions.<br/><br/>I've taken Vincent's suggestion from Apocalypse World to '<b>circle around the answer</b>'. When thinking about what happens in scenes or what's true about a character, I don't want players to feel forced to lock down an answer that's not quite right in order to move the game along. I'd rather they took their time to come up with an answer that feels true to them based on insight and gut instinct. To the end, everyone's has the ability (almost like a move, or one of Archiplego's key phrases) to encourage people to circle around the answer.<br/><br/>I also don't want the game to prioritise conflict as something that must happen in every scene. It took me a long time, lots of reviewer comments, and lots of playtesting to see how to make this work. Essentially, <b>it has to be OK for the characters to hang out</b>. I've created a rule that creates a consequence to just hanging out: the stat that controls how stable the Author's life is gets closer to becoming unstable.<br/><br/>Character creation involves also creating <b>a large and problematic collection of supporting characters</b> who surround the science-fiction authors who are the protagonists of the game. And the game encourages players to add more supporting characters as you play, leading to the appearance of historical figures, people inspired by conflicts between the Establishment and the counter-culture, and even characters from the authors' own novels. That loose, free-wheeling sense of community and ability to meet anyone is really rewarding in play and feels very 60s.<br/><br/>Giving players <b>creative inspiration</b> seems important, too. I've got a one-sheet in the game that lists musicians, drugs, popular hangouts, politicians and lots of other stuff that all gets players thinking about the time, place, and feel of the story they want to create.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382808/#Comment_382808" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-19T10:35:52+00:00" title="June 19, 2012 10:35AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm surprised nobody's mentioned Recon or GURPS Technomancer: Funny New Guys yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382813/#Comment_382813" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-19T11:42:54+00:00" title="June 19, 2012 11:42AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>With <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3362532/Left%20Coast%20%28June%202012%20playtest%20version%29.pdf" rel="nofollow">Left Coast</a>, I've used a few techniques.

In SoD, there's this Society researching Mnemozites - mysterious beings living in the dreams. Our Society was kinda Leary-like bunch, and we were not that much interested in Mnemozites, but rather in the impact of discovery of Mnemozites upon society. We were connecting lots of people (JFK, Madoff, Bush senior, Manson, Genesis P-Orridge, name it) and their acts with the Society and Mnemozites. Lots of fun.<br/><br/>We also played some '60s-placed games with The Drifter's Escape, and it's an excellent game to play beatnik-road movies things, among others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383281/#Comment_383281" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-24T20:37:24+00:00" title="June 24, 2012  8:37PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>We too played 60's with Society of Dreamers.</blockquote>\nHigh-five!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
