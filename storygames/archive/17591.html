He and his hireling were chased out of some ancient keep by a warorg carrying a "triple-axe". Apparently that hireling (Marcus, I think it was? I thought this one would last, I really did) got <i>got</i> by it.<br/><br/>Kerwil and the others nodded sagely, and not to feel left out, I did too. But it's been like two weeks now and I can't quite figure out what the planes that warorg was carrying. A "triple-axe?" I was thinking maybe it was three axe-heads all going in the same direction, but apparently it's not. Heck, it might even be metaphorical, some kind of grandiose name. <br/><br/>Now, not like I'm going to encounter one or anything--not planning on raiding a warorg lair--but has anyone seen one of these things before?<br/><br/>Show me. Draw me a picture.<br/><br/>If you've heard of something, post the name and what you've heard of it.

These are smelted in great numbers out of cheap bronze in the Warorg pits, and the three-bladed design is intended to be rotated as the blades dull. In practice this requires some finesse, so they end up being used as very nasty crushing instruments.<br/><br/>Are you guys going to Bulldrag's party on the solstice?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3441990/triple_axe.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398719/#Comment_398719" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T06:18:11+00:00" title="November 26, 2012  6:18AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2012 6:19AM by Andy.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!

That conflation dates back to a weapons appendix entry in the fourth edition of <i>Muzzfidgit's Villainy,</i> the inaccurate (and racist!) monster field guide that was mass-duplicated by Wizardstock Press (they rope in illegal immigrant mages to cast shoddy Duplication spells on their tomes, with predictably degenerating quality) and sold in every tavern this side of Netherblack Pass to zero-levels who didn't know any better, up until the release of the (still problematic but nevertheless better) fifth printing, which omits both the "elf-whip" and "triple-axe" entries for tax reasons. The term "elf-whip" more properly refers to the springsteel batons which trainee moblin-wranglers use before they're cleared for full-length mobliprods, and can be traced etymologically to the wide variety of elf comparisons used as derogatory insults which moblin-wranglers have to memorize in Year 1.5 of apprenticeship. On the other claw, the term "triple-axe" refers to the <b>suite of three weapons</b> currently used in the Warorg Compository, specifically the batbat, fish hatchet, and yes, the <i>Lul'gi'jak-Sh\xfcf\xe4r G\xe4kh</i> (omitting the diacritics is tantamount to thoicide, I'll have you know) which you describe\u2014though I would categorize them as smashing, rather than crushing, instruments.<br/><br/>I am 1/16 warorg and 1/32 moblin on my mother's side, and as such take your misappellations as an act of war.

Count his fingers, I'll bet you 5 Stygians that if he uses them regularly, he's missing at least one.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A8ov63gCcAA2k4r.jpg:medium"/><br/><br/>A dragon's tear (at least, what we call them in the South) is basically a cheap, fragile, unstable makeshift clay or ceramic bomb. Well, these days they're made out of metal, but back then they were mostly clays.<br/> You set them down carefully, and have a low-level mage throw a "Fog" spell at it, which combines with some water-sensitive reagents. When it works, it goes off like a fireball, not so much "hot" as "sharp and shrapnel-y". I heard these were used in the old days to clear ancient Dwarven cairns of monstrous resettlers. <br/><br/>They make that howling noise when the fog mixes with the reagents, building pressure which seeps through the cracks in the container-pot. Usually takes about 30 seconds before it explodes.<br/><br/>Still, it was said that for every 10 you set, one's gonna go off in your face. They're really, Really not safe.<br/><br/>The new ones made of metal are much safer, and can be set off from a further distance away. But ultimately too fragile to carry in long-distance travel, and more expensive than other common traps. Still, it's an old gem when used properly. Bulldrag must really have a fondness for the old stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398726/#Comment_398726" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T08:03:56+00:00" title="November 26, 2012  8:03AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2012 8:04AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, good to know.

They were about the size of an open palm, and were played by being plucked with the thumbs. You'd hold it like a prayer book and pluck 3 with one thumb and the other 3 with the opposite.<br/><br/>But that version got a bad reputation, because they also served as makeshift weapons. Many's the time a sneaky assassin pretended to be a poor beggar busker to get close to a target, only to hurl his instrument into the target's throat. It was considered a particularly skillful kill if they were singing along to your playing at the time.<br/><br/>But almost certainly what would have been played for a padishah would be the much larger Royal Six-Tone. This is a much larger version, built around a fancy inlaid sounding box the size of a man's torso and played with small hammers. Instead of nails, it features 6 triangular extensions, each bent unevenly so that it strikes a different tone if you hit one side or the other. <br/><br/>Of course, that means that the Royal Six-Tone actually strikes 12 notes. Go figure.<br/><br/>Together the 6 triangles extending from the sounding box make for a lovely star shape with uneven but cross-balanced legs. And the playing is a fascinating mixture of gong and chimes. 20 of them playing together would be quite the impressive display.<br/><br/>[Edited to illustrate]<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25971942@N06/8224849904/" rel="nofollow" title="SixTone by Rob McDiarmid, on Flickr"><img alt="SixTone" height="200" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8207/8224849904_229c223365.jpg" width="500"/></a><br/>The Six-Tone Star on the left, and the Royal Six-Tone Star on the right. Note that these are on massively different scales. The one on the left is about 6 inches across. The one on the right is about 3 feet across.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398747/#Comment_398747" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T12:07:08+00:00" title="November 26, 2012 12:07PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://www.unfretted.com/pages/gallery/more_images/vai_three_neck.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398750/#Comment_398750" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T12:12:47+00:00" title="November 26, 2012 12:12PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2012 12:13PM by Burr.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A triple axe is a pole with a heavily weighted pommel, due the pole being long enough to bear three axe-wielding spriggans.

A working one would have been filled with an alchemical mixture (unique to each Tear). They would light a fire under it and the player would blow into the mouthpiece, making the pores on the surface emit ululating wails and clouds of soporific smoke. They say it inspired a profound sense of ennui in listeners. Through a combination of breath control by the player and strategic banking of the fire by his assistant, the tone and tenor of the sadness was modulated.<br/><br/>Not many left who know how to play one, though. Inevitably they'd accidently inhale directly from the mouthpiece and be driven in a sadness so deep they no longer took food or water, or else commit suicide.<br/><br/>I have a question, now, for those who live nearer the sea than I do. Galbag's 'A Young Man's Travails on the Flayed Coast' mentions every public house having a <b>'Fisherman's Lament'</b> nailed over the door, but frustratingly he never describes one! Is this some functional item, or a written document? Something else?

Only the most elite warogs are allowed to wield them--it's part of their initiation ritual. Two hopefuls are both given triple axes for the first time and fight to the death.

If one latches onto your boat, it starts drilling through the wood and before you know it, there's a hole the size of a <b>Thunder Thumb</b>.

Certainly the origin comes from the "moving barnacle" called Fisherman's Lament. That's the reason that sailors from the Flayed Coast are kind of a stigma in other seas: In truth, seafarers fear that particular nasty ship-eater, and being a suspicious folk, they lash out unfavorably against folks from the Flayed Coast.<br/><br/>Perhaps even because of that stigma, sailors from the Flayed Coast are actually paragons of their craft: Organized, hard-working, and they keep their ships meticulously clean.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A85c3VFCYAEcLlW.jpg:medium"/><br/><br/>The barnacle itself can move, it doesn't root into wood like its common ancestor, but can travel slowly. They are voracious consumers and can eat through a hull if uncontrolled, but they are at the same time easily stripped and removed from a surface.<br/><br/>But the totem called the "Fisherman's Lament" is simply a piece of wood (usually rotten) from a ship that sank, nailed to the door of a sailing family to ward away bad fortune at sea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399156/#Comment_399156" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-29T14:11:26+00:00" title="November 29, 2012  2:11PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2012 2:13PM by Nathan_H.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://s251.photobucket.com/albums/gg305/nehrrld/?action=view&amp;current=triplebladednonsense.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Photobucket" src="http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg305/nehrrld/triplebladednonsense.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/>I was thinking something like a steering wheel.
