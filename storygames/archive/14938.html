Some games break when the players are outside their comfort zones. Freeform seems to work great with experienced people.<br/><br/>Also, good GMs seem to be able to run good games with any system and when I play a great game I always have the doubt.. was it the system or was it  the GM? It also takes guts to run a game trusting just your improv skills. A game that expects it as a prerequisite (and doesn't cater for it in the system) might fail with the wrong GM.<br/><br/>Has anyone already tried to reason about the different <b>comfort</b> and <b>skill</b> dimensions of games? How do you put the players back into the System?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339715/#Comment_339715" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T21:26:08+00:00" title="August 19, 2011  9:26PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you clarify your inquiry by citing some specific examples of what you are referring to?<br/><br/>Generally speaking, games don't break because they force players out of their comfort zones. Getting out of your grove is necessary for achieving personal growth. However, I am responding from the perspective of "I am uncomfortable with the idea of doing improv in an game" rather than "I am uncomfortable having my character torture innocent people." For the later see the whole lines and veils discussion. The important thing to take into consideration is maintaining focus, and allowing for adjustment before introducing new "uncomfortable" elements. Do take into consideration player behavior though as discomfort may lead to disruptive behavior.<br/><br/>Switching focus to the matter of the "right" GM. The notion that a good GM can make any system sing is a bit of a misnomer. You might be able to play with a GM that makes most of his sessions an enjoyable experience, but that somewhat independent of system. Basically, individuals that run games as such have a bag of tricks that they know work well and apply them accordingly. So, if you have a session with a good GM and you want to know how much of it was system and how much was GM just take a look at the rules engagement for the system. The greater the rules engagement, the more the system played an influence, the lower the rules engagement the more the GM influenced the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339717/#Comment_339717" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T21:53:01+00:00" title="August 19, 2011  9:53PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was inspired by a recent Fiasco thread: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14925&amp;page=1#Item_13" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14925&amp;page=1#Item_13</a><br/><br/>Some people were pointing out how Fiasco is not working for them, while it is working for other people. Other people again said how you must get experience with scene framing and 'just going with it' to make it work.  I interpret this as a skill and comfort zone requirement to the game that is not made explicit.<br/><br/>I like how lines and veils, by defining a concept, made visible an aspect of the game that I never saw before.<br/><br/>I wonder if a similar line of reasoning can be applied to creative comfort zones and gaming 'skills'. I also wonder what happens when you make this requirement explicit. My guess is that there would be games that some people perceive as broken as simply being outside their requirements/expectations/skills.<br/><br/>For what concerns the GM I agree with you.. there is a mix of game mechanics and 'bag of tricks', which to me is still a mix of creative comfort zone and experience/skills. If we don't put the GM skills back in the equation and we assume that a game is just going to work because it has certain mechanics, we are hiding the fact that we implicitly designed for some basic level of skill and creative comfort.<br/><br/>I am sure someone must have gone down this path of enquiry before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
