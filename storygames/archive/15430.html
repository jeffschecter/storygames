I typically do not play traditional games anymore (i.e. DnD, Shadowrun, Savage Worlds, Story Teller) as they just do not keep my interest. I prefer to run rather short campaigns of around 10-12 sessions to keep things new and fresh, longer is of course a possibility if the game is going really great. <br/><br/>Things I am possibly interested in running: <br/>\u2022\tDiaspora<br/>\u2022\tQuixalted<br/>\u2022\tFate (Likely a Steam punk / Planescape hack)<br/>\u2022\tTechnoire<br/>\u2022\tSmallville ( wushu fantasy )\t<br/>\u2022\tLeverage (not modern day, either fantasy or sci-fi)<br/><br/>As you can tell I like to keep the games interesting and different, but I am always open to suggestions and player feedback. If there is a game that you are interested in let me know I may be willing to run that as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
