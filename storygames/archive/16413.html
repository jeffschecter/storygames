A certain kind of... group thought phenomenon, I don't know what it is exactly, tends to settle around some Game Chef ingredients, where one particular interpretation of an ingredient really dominates and shows up in lots of the games that use it. This year, that was "Coyote" with the interpretation "Native American trickster god".<br/><br/>Some of this made me feel uncomfortable. I'll say up front that I myself know next to nothing about real Native American culture or mythology. I abandoned my own game based around the Coyote ingredient for just this reason; I felt like anything I did would just be a recapitulation of shopworn (and racist!) Native American themes drawn from cinema and other pop culture.<br/><br/>Of course, Native American cultural appropriation is all over the place, from dreamcatchers to the Washington Redskins, and a lot of it gets passed over or waved way, largely because of how successful a genocide was perpetrated against them, meaning that there are few left to complain about it. But cultural appropriations and aggressions of this kind exist at many levels of varying blatancy, and Game Chef is no exception.<br/><br/>I don't want to single out particular games; this is more of a collective impression viewed over the competition as a whole rather than being informed by a close reading of any games in particular.<br/><br/>If you're not yourself from a particular culture or ethnicity, or are not sufficiently immersed in it, it can be difficult both to a) utilise referents from that culture respectfully and appropriately and b) see why the inappropriate and disrespectful ways in which you might want to use them are disrespectful and inappropriate.<br/><br/>Game Chef, by its nature a seat-of-the-pants get-inspiration-then-write-it-fast week-long game jam deal, does not lend itself to thorough respectful research and sober reflection on inter-cultural ethics. So I'm hardly surprised that we ended up with this kind of result.<br/><br/>But I feel like, as a community, this is something worth highlighting and being aware of. The hobby as a whole has had a terrible history with regard to minority representation and cultural appropriation; but a lot of it is inadvertent, brought on by simple ignorance or lack of awareness. Consciousness needs to be raised.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375000/#Comment_375000" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-29T22:36:04+00:00" title="April 29, 2012 10:36PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1<br/><br/>I don't have anything of substance to add, but thank you for posting this.

As designers we need to be really careful in how we portray groups with a history of oppression in our work. It isn't ok to pick and choose parts of people's cultures ala Twilight. I also know it can be a confusing space to navigate, and not everyone has been exposed to anti-oppression politics. For me it is just as difficult to figure out a good way to bring this up with folks with out sounding like I'm attacking them, or that I think I'm "better" for being all "educated" about oppression. <br/>I brought this up in my critique of a game I thought was well-written and looked like lots of fun. The NA elements, really didn't need to be there, but it is easy to see why the designer chose to add them. Sometimes it is as simple as avoiding some of the loaded words, like Shaman, or Tribe.

It's worth bringing attention to Liam's game, which took this aspect of Game Chef and subverted it (at least, I know he was doing it tongue-in-cheek), making a game about how the white guy goes native and gets the girl and the respect of the tribe, a la Dances with Wolves, Avatar, The Last Samurai, etc., etc.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YVsccienUbSjFVMHKP6K5X2zU5yYiDgio6Vw0yBOBNg/edit?pli=1" rel="nofollow">Big Chiefs: A game about Native Americans and the white people who love them.</a><br/><br/>Let's make this a good discussion, yeah? There's a lot to learn, and there's no "Native side" and "white side". I know Natives who love Dances with Wolves, and Natives that hate it.

The Native Americans we picture in our head aren't the same people we pass on the street, because if they aren't wearing a headdress most people couldn't pick a Native American out of a lineup of other vaguely brown people. I grew up in Montana, near a Blackfoot Reservation, and this was still true. You only heard about Natives with feathers on their heads or a bottle in their hands. It was disgusting. Even the most open-minded, liberal, race-sensitive people I knew in Montana didn't think anything of appropriating their food and culture and stereotyping them as drunks and criminals.<br/><br/>I heard from a friend that he mentioned to someone else how racially problematic GC was this year, and the response was basically "Well, we've already done everything we can to the Native Americans so what does it matter? We can't make it worse."<br/><br/>And that's the big lie. That they don't exist any more. That the caricatures we think of when we think of Native Americans belong to us. That we, as non-natives, can write about them and remix their history and their culture because it's not like we're going to run into a Native who is going to be EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE due to our behavior. We're okay. I mean, we have black friends and everything. <br/><br/>Note the "we." I am not absolving myself of this, although I did not participate in GC this year (largely because of the ingredients). I agree with what Hans is saying, about there being no Native side vs. White side. But a big part of that is the fact that for so many, when we think Native American our first thought is not an actual person we have met before. And if you have that little interaction with a culture, you shouldn't take it as your own. Shit, I've been a part of a crazy Indian family for four years now and I wouldn't feel comfortable writing a game about Indian culture the way that these games are written about Natives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375008/#Comment_375008" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T00:27:48+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 12:27AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 12:31AM by C_Edwards.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After trying, and failing, to start this post six different ways, here's what I got. I have this love/hate relationship with appropriation. A lot of appropriation is exuberant, if ignorant, appreciation of the subject matter. Being forgiving and a flawed human being myself, I understand how and why that happens. Being a sometimes artist, I value the aesthetic and power that some images, concepts, and symbols have even if they're not my own. To an extent, I also feel that we don't own the contents of our cultures. They are us, but they're also bigger than us.<br/><br/>But it's also obvious that a lot of appropriation takes place without any internal checks or balances from those doing the appropriating. Exuberance isn't enough. Appreciation isn't enough. We also have to ask ourselves, "Does this in any way impinge upon the dignity of real, living human beings." If we don't care it's going to be obvious. Even if we do care, but fail to really examine and weigh our desires versus the emotional welfare of others, it's probably going to look like we don't care. We don't even have to necessarily get it all right, but we do have to try.<br/><br/>The Native American aspects of some of the games have gotten a lot of attention. That's understandable considering the extent of, and still ongoing state of, their oppression. I'm curious how people feel about the other games that have elements from cultures foreign to the designers. Just that I know of, we have games with Persian, Japanese, and South American content. What makes the elements of some of these other games different than the Native American content? Is there no difference? I ask out of genuine curiosity. Appropriation is a sticky subject. It doesn't help that it's been going on since ancient times, as the neighbors of powerful civilizations absorbed cultural elements from them and conquerors absorbed the cultures of the conquered.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375009/#Comment_375009" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T00:38:39+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 12:38AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what is the solution then, because on one hand the hobby can be panned because it is so white-centric, and on the other hand, unless you are an expert in non-white cultures, you are risking criticism for clumsy handling of non-white cultural issues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375010/#Comment_375010" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T01:06:12+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  1:06AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 1:16AM by Hans_c-o.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.

Appropriating someone else's culture is sticky, and maybe OK and maybe not, depending on the context.<br/><br/>The thing that happens with appropriation of Native American culture, though, that may or may not be happening with appropriation of the cultures you mention, is that the folks appropriating Native American culture (by and large) have <i>directly</i> benefited from the oppression of Natives. There is an unequal power relationship to this day. You can say, "that's not my fault, that's my ancestors or someone else's ancestors" or whatever. This isn't about laying blame. It's about being cognizant of reality and what that means for your responsibility.<br/><br/>Speaking as myself, a white U.S. citizen, appropriating Native culture is a direct extension of that oppression, and that oppression is why it's easy to appropriate Native culture (as Elizabeth has said).<br/><br/>If you want to get down to details, I'm Norwegian-American. Writing a game about the German-American experience, as me, while still problematic, is vastly different from writing about the Native American experience. You can see why, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375011/#Comment_375011" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T01:06:57+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  1:06AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This issue was first really brought to my attention back in... 2007? The Art First Game Chef, whenever that was. One of the art sets was a bunch of tiki-headed dudes, often with sci-fi-like trappings, and I was totally going to write a game about that until people started mentioning that maybe reducing the symbols of another culture -- one I didn't know anything about -- to cartoons like that wasn't cool. I wasn't sure where I landed on that, but I did know that whatever I did wasn't going to make any sort of interesting statement about tiki or Polynesian cultures or anything, so I dropped it. (Then I wrote a game about cavemen and dinosaurs. Hubris!)<br/><br/>And I'll admit, I purposely steered clear of the Coyote ingredient this time around partially because of that memory. I mean, I also didn't have any great ideas for Coyote, and it seemed like it'd be a popular ingredient because it's immediately evocative of something, but the danger of resurrecting that cultural-appropriation issue was a part of it, too.<br/><br/>I certainly think the ingredient could be (and in some cases was) used tastefully and thoughtfully. If you're using it to evoke Native American cultures, though, you have to go into it knowing what kind of statement you're making <i>about</i> those cultures. (This is a reason I think Liam really nailed it with <i>Big Chiefs</i>, because he managed to flip that around and make something of a meta-statement about the whole idea of white people making a statement about Native Americans.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375012/#Comment_375012" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T01:08:23+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  1:08AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.

(This is a reason I think Liam really nailed it with<i>Big Chiefs</i>, because he managed to flip that around and make something of a meta-statement about the whole idea of white people making a statement about Native Americans.)</blockquote>\nIn the gaming hobby at least, most appropriation doesn't seem to be meant to make any sort of statement. It's people playing Cultural Legos, basically. All the exoticism, none of the guilt! That's not less problematic, only problematic in different ways.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite>If you want to get down to details, I'm Norwegian-American. Writing a game about the German-American experience, as me, while still problematic, is vastly different from writing about the Native American experience. Can you see why?</blockquote>\nWell, I see that as related, but not the real difference. There have been past situations where a non-American designer has used Native American content in ill-conceived ways and it turned into a far bigger deal than what we're seeing over these Game Chef games. I think it has more to do with our reactions to genocide and the extent to which Native Americans have been oppressed more than it does any position of benefit from it. Of course, it's also a hotter issue for Americans in general simply because it's our past and our present, regardless of benefit. Actually, I think that it still being our present is the real difference. It's not like Native Americans were peoples conquered a thousand years ago and currently either fully assimilated or with healthy, revived cultures. We're still living through the aftermath of attempted genocide.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_375018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375018/#Comment_375018" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T01:59:50+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  1:59AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>Research.

It's the exotic used for window-dressing, but otherwise it's actually quite familiar, and even sticks to familiar stereotypes and tropes which may not even still be "exotic" (by which I mean novel and unfamiliar, the same way Simon used it).<br/><br/>For example: The Last Samurai. This movie is based on a true story -- the true story of Frederick Townsend Ward, who trained Chinese troops in Western tactics in the early 1860s. Problem is, there is no kung fu in that story! Who wants to see a movie about China that doesn't have any kung fu in it? That's right, nobody. so they set it in Japan with samurai. License to print money!<br/><br/>One leads to the other, of course. If nobody wanted to see something exotic (a movie about Japan), there would be no exoticism (The Last Samurai).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_375038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375038/#Comment_375038" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T05:36:28+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  5:36AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite>This is easy to say from a position of privilege.</blockquote>What do you know of my position?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>I have to respectfully disagree with this part, Tomas.

When people engage in the sort of cultural appropriation that most people would agree is offensive, they're not usually writing an entire game about it. Instead they borrow bits of colour in whatever way they find entertaining, making it obvious to anyone who understands the culture even a little bit that they haven't a clue. I can't really think of a game that fits your description, although I may be overlooking something.<br/><br/>I don't think we should dismiss the idea of learning about another culture and writing a game that reflects what you've learned. Most people can tell the difference between an honest attempt to do a subject justice (and will offer constructive criticism rather than take offence) and one that just can't be bothered.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375047/#Comment_375047" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T06:16:11+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  6:16AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi all,<br/><br/>Disagreement is awesome. <br/><br/>But please don't escalate the conversation because it will go from listening, learning, and reaching mutual understanding to defensiveness, counter-attacks, no longer listening and then eventually the thread will plummet into chaos and worse... a wasted opportunity. <br/><br/>Which would suck because it's a topic which we can learn a lot from each other. <br/><br/>To be clear. <br/><br/>Disagreement = awesome, especially if you explain why and share your personal experiences while not denying or invalidating other's experiences.

When a single white jury convicts a single black suspect, that's not racism by itself. When, systematically, white juries are 70% more likely to convict black suspects than they are white suspects, that's racism.<br/><br/>"Most people agree" erases the watchdogs and whistle-blowers.

I thought about saying something about it to Joe -- encouraging him to change the ingredients -- but then I thought: hey, this is an opportunity to learn something and have a conversation about a real issue in game design (as we can see from the current conversation about Steampunk Musha). I wasn't quite sure how this would play out, but I'm glad that someone other than me noticed this and started the conversation. I notice this stuff all the time in gaming, partially because of my own background in Asian studies (that's what I do for a living), and it's definitely something that can be troublesome and worth talking about.<br/><br/>I would encourage folks to engage this topic honestly and without being defensive or feeling like you have to stick to your guns and defend what you or someone else has created, especially if you did not participate in Game Chef this year. I also feel like it's important to acknowledge that, while there is a diversity of folks on SG, there haven't historically been many who are Native American or First Nations (though there are at least a couple), and those that have participated here may not be from peoples with strong cultural associations about coyotes, so it's also important that nobody attempt to speak for them or claim to know how their culture should be treated.

The poster children of cultural misappropriation are not entire games designed around something the designer knows nothing about, that's all I'm saying here.<br/><br/>By the way, your take on this as being about racism, and racism as mostly about "whites" vs "people of color" looks very American to my eyes. Over here in the UK, we have historically had all sorts of other neat ways of discriminating against people on the basis of group identities (Irish, Catholic/Protestant, Gypsy, Jewish). And over in Tibet, it's a different story again. I appreciate that the example of Coyote is specifically American, but there are wider issues at play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375075/#Comment_375075" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T08:18:36+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  8:18AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From the sideline here; I didn't participate in Game Chef, I didn't know there was a coyote there, and I'm not American or Native American.<br/><br/>I think I'd never write a game about Native American culture. This is very much based on experiences from Story Games, and to a lesser extent other fora &amp; projects. I would feel there was way too much I didn't know, and thus had to learn - I'm pretty lazy when it comes to trying to understand a whole culture &amp; history, so I mostly stick to my own or fictional ones. If I were to write a game involving coyotes, it would probably be based on real coyotes with no mythological strings attached. (Or, you know, zombie porn coyotes or surrealist mindreading coyotes or something like that).<br/><br/>(I've got some extremely half-formed thoughts about how U. S. culture uses Nordic mythology, and the relationship between the U. S. and Norway. Can your culture be said to be appropriated even if you're rich &amp; white &amp; privileged? Can you be colonized happily, voluntarily &amp; enthusiastically? This is probably beyond the scope of this thread, though. Or maybe I can try to play Dog Eat Dog about it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375076/#Comment_375076" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T08:28:22+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  8:28AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very nice backpedal, Dave.

There are countless ways "coyote" could be used in a game and not come off as racist. How about a game about the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote? How about use  coyote in the context of a pack of coyotes? They sound like (mimic) laughing children. There's two elements right there. How about the notion that when coyotes come into contact with humans, bad things happen? Coyotes routinely hunt and kill cats and dogs in our area and they're one of the few animals you can legally use bait when hunting them. Is that racist? It sucks for coyotes, but it's not racist. Killing coyotes because they're considered nuisance animals when they "invade" your country homestead and kill your cat (who should be indoors anyway if you live in the woods) certainly reflects the arrogance of humanity, but not racism.<br/><br/>Of course any of the above coyote elements can be modified in a hateful, racist way. Or not.<br/><br/>I used coyote in my game. Originally one of the PCs was an actual coyote. Then he became a kitsune, because I set the game in a mythological Japanese setting, and because I know next to nothing about Native American mythology. On the other hand, I could write a thesis about Japanese folklore and its use in modern and historic works. The most I know about Old Man Coyote in Native American folklore is that like kitsune, he's considered a trickster archetype. I might have changed coyote the trickster into a Brer Rabbit-type character if I had changed the setting to an African American folkloric setting. What would have been ridiculous cultural appropriation is if I had taken Old Man Coyote and put him in my Japanese mythological setting without any context or valid explanation. That would have been a cop out, too. Roadrunner vs. Wile E. would have made a better use of the element. I personally have a stronger association with "coyote" as cat-killing, laughing children-mimicking, dog-like wild animals that I am psyched to see and hear on the rare occasions that I see and hear them. They're like foxes, too, right? And in folklore they're used as trickster archetypes like foxes, rabbits, spiders, and wolves. I don't know enough about Old Man Coyote and Native American folklore to use "coyote" in such a game where I have less than a week to write. Native American folklore is too broad a term to even touch in less than a week. Which Native American culture?<br/><br/>"Trickster" isn't racist either. The trickster archetype is universal and has a variety of functions, depending on the culture it's in. So Brer Rabbit in African American folklore represents the slave. He always outwits Brer Fox, and in doing so attains something of value, like a good meal or some measure of rest and safety. In Japanese folklore, there are stories of kitsune who take the form of a beautiful woman, marries a human man, and they have a family. Someone betrays her (often unintentionally) and reveals her true nature. She leaves her human family behind, never to return. <br/><br/>If you take some element of a culture about which you know little, and you use that element without proper context, you're engaging in cultural appropriation. It's irresponsible and lazy at the very least, and racist at its worst. Being ironic or doing this accidentally is still irresponsible, lazy, and possible racist. Ironic racism and accidental racism are still racism. So non-game related example: I have a friend who is a tattoo artist. He generally will not do kanji or Chinese characters in tattoos because he has no reliable source of translation, and he doesn't want to do a tattoo of the word "shit baby" when the client hands him a character to copy (that he copied from a website), and the client thinks it says "wise and clever." Perhaps the onus is really on the client, but my friend feels a great deal of responsibility as the artist and doesn't want to cause harm to his client. <br/><br/>So those of us who decided to use coyote in our games really owed it to ourselves and our games and the community as a whole to look at other facets of "coyote," and avoid misuing it. I didn't see anywhere in the Game Chef rules that stated  "coyote" had to carry Native American connotations with it. A coyote can just be a coyote in a game with no Native American themes and it can be a perfectly good game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375082/#Comment_375082" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T09:15:41+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  9:15AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Willow</cite>So, who's fault is it?<br/><br/>Is it Jonathan Walton's fault that 'Coyote' was used as a word?

I chose the word list.<br/><br/>I think I had a different set of connotations for "coyote" than the majority of Game Chef participants. Like, I just moved out of a house where I could hear coyotes howling all the time - they were a symbol of hunger and wildness in my mind. And, in the area I have been living in, the common derogatory narrative of first nations people is that of reservation drunks, not of essentialized "cowboy and indian" characters. I think... maybe the "feathered headband" character is less alive in the Canadian collective imagination than in the American? I don't know.<br/><br/>When I chose coyote, I saw four distinct and evenly-weighted possibilities for how it might be engaged:<br/>-scarcity and hunger<br/>-wilderness survival<br/>-transnational human smuggling<br/>-first nations/native american mythology<br/><br/>But the latter dominated its use in Game Chef entries, and I found myself feeling unsettled or awkward about that fact. So: whoops. That was my fault. (Or, alternately, it was the fault of a collective lack of imagination around that ingredient. But I'm happy to claim it as my own mistake and try to avoid the same in the future.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375084/#Comment_375084" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T09:35:53+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  9:35AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess we're way off from getting a "games about ethnic minorities" theme in IGC if Joe's sorry about using an ingredient that correlates with a real-world culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375085/#Comment_375085" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T09:36:44+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  9:36AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>Research.

Doing it with respect for human beings and their culture is good too, but we do not have to place the list too high. Most designers are amateurs, and can not be expected to live up to professional standards. That is indeed true for a competition like Game Chef.<br/><br/>If they try their best, as Edwards says, I'm content. Having erred they will get comments, and maybe learn something from that. Learning by doing is the best way ;-)<br/><br/>So it's only bad to be racist if you're being PROFESSIONALLY racist? It's harmless to be racist as a hobby? I kind of want to see those business cards.<br/><br/>Seriously, it doesn't matter whether you're a professional RPG designer or a professional wrestler or God knows what else.

This implies that each game should be judged on its own merits, and not as part of a generalized trend.<br/><br/>It seems possible that there are some Game Chef entries that would meet the criteria for respectful, well researched use of Native American culture. It also seems likely that some of the games fall short of this standard. However, until we start talking about the games themselves, and stop judging the entries as a whole based on a superficial glance at their titles and two sentences blurbs, it's going to be hard to have a productive conversation about this subject.<br/><br/>And, worse, we're being unfair to designers who took the time to do the research and had the empathy and understanding to make complex, nuanced games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375089/#Comment_375089" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T09:42:39+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  9:42AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we simultaneously suffer from folks who too easily offend others, folks who are too easily offended, folks who give criticism badly, and folks who take criticism badly.

I introduced an ingredient that spawned a lot of co-opting of First Nations/Native American mythology. I feel like some of the entries were thoughtful and well-researched, and others were maybe more overtly an exercise in cultural appropriation. But we've now got dialogue... So maybe the ingredient choice will be a problematic one that spawns fruitful conversation.<br/><br/>But yeah, I don't imagine you'll see an "ethnic minorities" theme for Game Chef while I'm the Master Chef, as I find talking about race and ethnicity to be scary, and I feel like I'm constantly engaged in a process of learning how naive I am. I think those traits are okay for a person who's trying to explore and understand race, but not for someone who's trying to run a contest for 50-90 people to create games about race/ethnicity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375094/#Comment_375094" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T09:52:01+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  9:52AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are some solid posts here (Hans, Shreyas and Elizabeth, McDaldno, Johnstone, Julia, anybody else who mentioned one of my games). I was going to write a big post about this topic, but in the time it took me to get ready, Julia basically covered every element I wanted to note, so. I'll just respond to a few people.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>I really wish someone made some guidelines.<br/>I don't think anybody would be a jerk on purpose. You just don't see what you don't see.<br/>How can you be made to see it?<br/>Seriously, how?</blockquote>\nBelieve me, if I knew the answer to this, I wouldn't be here (because the Man would have me assassinated). It's not about being perfectly aware immediately -- I've definitely done and said things in my past that on consideration were racist or sexist, and it's a process to train yourself out of doing so, because my upbringing (at least) didn't provide me with a bunch of grounding for doing that. I just try to listen when people point out my failings (difficult), and when I'm not sure about something I'm thinking of writing, I ask somebody. It's all I can do! I don't think anybody here expects everybody else to be perfect, just to be humble. I admire McDaldno's willingness, for example, to say "Well, whether or not it was my fault, I could've done things differently and I'll remember this next time."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I guess we're way off from getting a "games about ethnic minorities" theme in IGC if Joe's sorry about using an ingredient that correlates with a real-world culture.</blockquote>\nTotal honesty? I don't, personally, want to see a theme like that in Game Chef. Especially given that Game Chef prizes getting the game out quickly over cleaning up all the rough edges. (Not that that's necessarily a bad thing -- it was awfully helpful for me, for example -- but I think we're seeing here that that culture is not a great fit with possibly sensitive topics.) If your goal is to encourage cultural awareness and thoughtful discourse, I think that's exactly the wrong way to go about it.<br/><br/>Now, a "games BY ethnic minorities" theme might be interesting...(Although I'll note that there are quite a few people of color in the finalists and runners up!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375096/#Comment_375096" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T09:54:33+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  9:54AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whduryea</cite>After reading through this thread, I noticed that only one Game Chef entry,<i>Big Chiefs</i>, was mentioned by name.<br/><br/>This troubles me, since the prevailing argument in this thread seems to be that appropriation is more than just "white dudes making games about non-white dudes," but rather a function of whether the game (or novel or movie or whatever) deals with its subject matter with respect and a sophisticated understanding of the history and perspectives of the culture being portrayed. This is implies that each game should be judged on its own merits, and not as part of a generalized trend.<br/><br/>It seems possible that there are some Game Chef entries that would meet the criteria for respectful, well researched use of Native American culture. It also seems likely that some of the games fall short of this standard. However, until we start talking about the games themselves, and stop judging the entries as a whole based on a superficial glance at their titles and two sentences blurbs, it's going to be hard to have a productive conversation about this subject.<br/><br/>And, worse, we're being unfair to designers who took the time to do the research and had the empathy and understanding to make complex, nuanced games.</blockquote>\nI could have done this. I thought about it. But I figured that the loss, in either raising the defensive hackles of the individuals concerned or in engaging in empty-chair othering of absent authors would wipe out any gain from deeper analysis.<br/><br/>I might instead offer that anyone who wants to <b>volunteer</b> their game for a critique of this kind is welcome to do so, preferably in another thread, and there I'll do my best to offer my honest thoughts in the hope they'll be received in a spirit of self-improvement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375097/#Comment_375097" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T09:54:41+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  9:54AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>By the way, your take on this as being about racism, and racism as mostly about "whites" vs "people of color" looks very American to my eyes.

Game Chef is about getting your crappy game done and out the door, not stopping and thinking for five minutes about the extremely obvious problems in what you're doing.

People are getting a bit up in arms. Which is understandable, because this is a very sensitive topic. Maybe more calm conversation would be more fruitful here instead of the blaming and arguing that's beginning to occur?<br/><br/>Also, I think it's really interesting that coyote was an ingredient, specifically because it helps us have conversations about culture in game design that are really interesting. The nature of most game chef games is definitely to rush, so I'm sure there's some accidental cultural appropriating due to the time limit. I stayed away from the Native American associations of coyote, and actually that ingredient, altogether because of the amount of time I had to prepare a finished game! But... for those people who did tackle it, and tried to deal with cultural and Native American themes... I say bravo to them for trying! I'm sure they'd really appreciate constructive feedback on how to make their games stronger too, in all sorts of ways. Maybe helping is better than blaming, in this instance? Or assuming any kind of racism? With Game Chef we have the opportunity to teach and learn, that's at the heart of the contest. I think this is actually a pretty unique opportunity to go somewhere with these discussions.

Why? Well, it's complex, but it largely comes down to the fact that the Nordic peoples from which you're appropriating viking myth are these days comfortable white Europeans, who are not, by and large, the victims of systematic oppression related to their ethnic background; whereas if you're appropriating Japanese myth, you have to deal with the problem that less than 70 years ago, America was rounding the Japanese into internment camps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375114/#Comment_375114" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T10:28:07+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 10:28AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 10:33AM by Elizabeth.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Tomas! It's Elizabeth, with a Z. Thanks for your awesome advice on how to conduct myself on a forum I have belonged to for an incredibly long time! I don't know what I would do without you.<br/><br/>I don't find making games about other people's cultures to be educational. I find learning about other people's cultures to be educational. Once I am educated I am inspired to make a game. What do you think of my process?<br/><br/>I'm never going to commend anyone for appropriation. Maybe that makes me a bitch. I can live with that. But if you don't have the time to treat a subject that is real and human for millions of people with respect, you should find another subject. I'm not saying amateurs can't make games about other cultures. I'm saying they need to step up their game.<br/><br/>I'm also saying you owe an apology to every teenager or hobbyist who ever made an ethically responsible game. I managed to not make an appropriationist or problematic game when I was a hobbyist. It's not that hard to do. In fact, it's EASIER because it requires less effort.<br/><br/>You don't get a driver's license if you're not willing to learn the rules of the road. You don't get to appropriate unless you're willing to do what's necessary to ensure a lack of injury.

Everybody already got four reviews, most of which were impressively positive and designed to encourage people to keep designing. Kudos to Jon Walton for his review advice and for almost all the designers for following it. We did commend people for trying -- but it's important to also talk about the things they got wrong.

I do not expect serious research and ethically fool-proofness from a project designed under such premises. So I will cut such a designer some slack, and rather try to commend him/her for trying.

I'm going to focus on some other angle that I can make shine." Use the time constraint to the benefit of your imagination. Even an amateur can write a  solid game in a week, creatively using the elements given, and produce something that doesn't shit on another culture. The time constraint can make for some creative use of the ingredients. If you don't know much about coyotes in a Native American context, don't use coyotes in a Native American context. Think outside the Native American Coyote box and come up with something fresh and interesting. That's not only respectful game design, it's creative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375119/#Comment_375119" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T10:33:39+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 10:33AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Maybe helping is better than blaming, in this instance?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>There is a thing that we say in social justice: It is not my responsibility (as a person of color / woman / religious minority / ethnic cleansing victim / LGBT person / person with a disability / whatever) to educate you on how to behave.</p>\n<p>It is every person's own responsibility to learn respect, and when someone tells you "You're not being respectful," it's your responsibility to take their word for it, modify your behavior appropriately, and do your own research to figure out why when it's convenient for you.

Couple of things I noticed:<br/><br/>* "Native American names." There are quite a few games that tell you to make up a Native American name "like Walks With Tree or Dances With Wolves." Sometimes they say "be cliche" or "stereotypical." Unsurprisingly, this is stereotypical, and immediately puts the most hackneyed ideas about Native Americans into your head. It's also not typically all that accurate -- there are lots and lots of Native American tribes with different naming conventions. You guys must've heard of Hiawatha, at least. I'll be honest and say I don't know enough about Native American naming traditions and social customs to talk about this indefinitely, but I'm confident that naming everybody Stands With a Fist is pretty disrespectful.<br/>* Coyote the trickster. Again, I'm not an expert, but Coyote is a culture hero in many Native American mythologies, creating the World (actually, a few worlds), being the assistant to the Creator on occasion, being tasked to kill monsters such as the Thunderbird, etc. etc. He's tricky and silly sometimes, sure, but so is Maui, or Odysseus. Reducing him to the "trickster," or even worse, to the tricky VILLAIN character, strikes me as a little uninformed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375133/#Comment_375133" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T11:01:45+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 11:01AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>Why is no-one making games about the Mighty Jay-zus, an immortal sun god who flies around and throws fish at people?<br/></blockquote>\nOther than Diana: Warrior Princess?

Thank you! Sorry I did not see them before. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite>* "Native American names." There are quite a few games that tell you to make up a Native American name "like Walks With Tree or Dances With Wolves." Sometimes they say "be cliche" or "stereotypical." Unsurprisingly, this is stereotypical, and immediately puts the most hackneyed ideas about Native Americans into your head. It's also not typically all that accurate -- there are lots and lots of Native American tribes with different naming conventions. You guys must've heard of Hiawatha, at least. I'll be honest and say I don't know enough about Native American naming traditions and social customs to talk about this indefinitely, but I'm confident that naming everybody Stands With a Fist is pretty disrespectful.</blockquote>Why? The one indian I have met, was a dakota chieftain called "Proud Eagle". He was a very engaging and wise man, more into teaching his own people and others of his old culture, than lamenting the past. I would expect him to be proud of having young kids (even white kids) playing characters with names like his own, making the "indian" into the hero of the narrative. <br/><br/>That aside; telling people to be stereotypical or cliche, is sound advice in all improvisation, as it enables players to take their preconceptions (good or badly founded) into the game, and contribute without being afraid of what they say. It is simple and good advice for gaming.<br/><br/>So; where's the <i>racism</i> in that?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite>* Coyote the trickster. Again, I'm not an expert, but Coyote is a culture hero in many Native American mythologies, creating the World (actually, a few worlds), being the assistant to the Creator on occasion, being tasked to kill monsters such as the Thunderbird, etc. etc. He's tricky and silly sometimes, sure, but so is Maui, or Odysseus. Reducing him to the "trickster," or even worse, to the tricky VILLAIN character, strikes me as a little uninformed.</blockquote>A little uninformed, yes. Taking figures from folklore, mythology and history is done all over the world, and they are twisted/misunderstood/misrepresented in a million ways. <br/><br/>It's lamentable fact, but all cultures are subjected to it, so where is the <i>racism</i>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375159/#Comment_375159" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T12:24:23+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 12:24PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 12:24PM by whduryea.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite><br/>Fair point.

His depiction of an African woman is racist. Period. Sure he commonly uses black face in his art. Sure he's of African descent. No fucking way does that give him a "not racist"  pass. In fact, using the black face in conjunction with a traditionally negative depiction of an African woman's body (a la the Venus Hottentot) just added insult to injury. He still doesn't get a pass because he was trying to make a statement about female genital mutilation. Doing it at the expense of black women was in poor taste. He got a lot of publicity, but the issue of FGM fell by the wayside. His statement became about him. <br/><br/>I think a lot of women of African descent, American or otherwise, had some of the following ideas:<br/>Makode Linde hates his sisters (meaning black women).<br/>Makode Linde hates himself (or his Africanness).<br/>Makode Linde is a tool for participating in an effort to make the Swedish cultural minister look bad and he did it at the expense of women of African descent. We already get the message that we (women of African descent) are considered ugly and worthless. He helped to reinforce that message. <br/><br/>I'm culling this from discussions I've had with other black women as well as my own reactions. Sure there are black women who thought his little stunt was awesome. Whatever. These were not kneejerk reactions. We've had lots of time and chances to feel this way about shit like this. Linde's intent and use of subversion might have had some altruistic purpose, but whatever altruistic intent he had got shouted down by his ego and his poor choice of imagery. Why the hell would you use two of the most negative and racist images of blackness to make a statement about FGM? If you add shit to Venus Hottentot shaped cake with a Golliwog head, it's going to smell and taste like shit and look like a Venus Hottentot with a golliwog head, regardless of context.<br/><br/>Again, accidental racism and ironic racism is still racism. <br/>Accidental cultural appropriation and ironic cultural appropriation is still cultural appropriation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375163/#Comment_375163" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T12:30:10+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 12:30PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lemon</cite><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite><cite>Posted By: lemon</cite>This thread is positively dripping with American privilege and assumptions.</blockquote>\nPlease expand!<br/><br/>I'll try to do so without being too, uh, inflammatory?<br/><br/>1. In a world where most of the world's "cultures" are being straight up<b>erased</b>by the current global cultural hegemon (the US), getting "appropriated" is a lifeline - a step up.<br/><br/>2.

The American reactions to Swedish artist Makode Linde's anti-imperial<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCK6zvWEN_Q" rel="nofollow">Painful Cake</a>consisted overwhelmingly of kneejerk accusations of racism.<br/><br/>That cake was totally racist! Intent doesn't actually matter very much, and there are contexts you may not be fully concious of which you are nevertheless operating in.<br/><br/>Racism DOES look and function the same everywhere, in the sense that it's always about racial prejudice and a power disparity between a privileged racial group and underprivileged ones. All that differs is who the privileged and underprivileged groups are. For the record, I'm European (British, in fact), but it doesn't take being American to spot racism against Native Americans. I am really wondering what differences you perceive in the way racism looks and operates outside the USA which are at all operative in terms of this conversation?<br/><br/>Appropriation might be a better thing than erasure, but those aren't the only two options!

I was personally iffy on the coyote issue, because the game doesn't mention Coyote the culture hero, just has you play a bunch of coyotes -- again, I'm not a Native American and I don't really know any well, so I don't want to speak as to how that might be received.

They exist. They are out there. If you want to solve racism (or cultural appropriation and other related problems), then seek them out and start working on yourself.<br/><br/>Here's an easy to follow flow chart if you're creating a game or written piece: <a href="http://mentalpolyphonics.com/posts/cultural-appropriation" rel="nofollow">http://mentalpolyphonics.com/posts/cultural-appropriation</a><br/><br/>Some of this tends to go on in oppression discussions. Don't do it: <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Oppression_Olympics" rel="nofollow">http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Oppression_Olympics</a>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: zircher</cite>Racist: a person with a prejudiced belief that one race is superior to others.</blockquote>\nThat is incorrect. Thought is not racist. Racism does not require a belief of a power imbalance. And prejudice alone does not make a person a racist. Racist and racism only matters when it is an action, and one that creates or reinforces a power imbalance.<br/><br/>You don't get racism by thinking it. You only get racism by acting on it.<br/><br/>I feel it's also important to note that the prejudice does not need to be based on superiority. It can stem from inferiority, or even a position of neutrality. Example: the idea that indigenous people are closer to nature and more honorable than whites is racist, even though on the surface it looks like a compliment.<br/><br/>Being racist is something any of us can do even if we personally do not believe our race to be better or worse than any other.<br/><br/>It's important for dialog to take that fact in. If someone calls your creative work racist, or something you said, or even you personally, what they are always talking about are specific actions, not you personally. If your reaction is "Of course it is, because that's the way things are/should be!" then you probably are a racist. However, I'm hoping that everyone here would have a reaction more like mine, "But I'm not racist!"<br/><br/>So, we can fight over who's right. Or I can step back and reassess my actions. Why did they find racism in something I did? Our experiences of racism differ. Did I do something accidental or ignorant? Did I deny their experience of race or race relations in some way?  It doesn't matter what I intended. As a creative person, I know that the work comes between intention and results. The results are the only thing that other people can access, so if people find something racist in my results, then I want to reassess them because that is not my intention.<br/><br/>What does not work is trying to explain my intention and convince them that it was done with love and understanding and respect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lantern314" title="lantern314"><img alt="lantern314" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lantern314">lantern314</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375192/#Comment_375192" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T13:23:18+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  1:23PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there has been a lot of really interesting discussion here and was impressed at the thoughtfulness displayed, especially in the early posts.<br/><br/>The idea that I haven't seen discussed is "why are we appropriating things from other cultures?" Thinking about that question leads to some insight into appropriateness and sensitivity. <br/>For me it falls into a couple of different categories. Sometimes it is a shorthand for a stereotyped idea. This is used positively and negatively. When we want a character to represent independence and toughness we make him a cowboy. When we want the expectation to be combative and drunk we make him Irish.<br/>Sometimes we do it to capture an idea, but remove it from reality. I think this is what has happened with the use of Norse deities in RPGs. We want divinity to play an active role, but we don't want it to be too "real" so we grab for another culture's stories. The insensitivity comes from dismissing another's religion as, "just stories." I don't know if there are still practitioners of traditional religions in Scandinavia, but there are lots of Native Americans for whom those myths are active and vibrant part of cultural heritage.<br/>In my last grouping we learn a little bit about something and that sliver captures our imagination. Rather than learning what lies beyond the boundaries of that sliver we just magnify it until it fills the space we want filled. I think this is where the Chinese character tattoos fall. Someone gets entranced by the shape without bothering to understand the meaning. We associate people of a particular culture with toughness and throw their likeness on the side of a football helmet. The idea that divinity has a playful, mischievous side reflects something in our experience we want to understand better, so we take another culture's stories of a divine trickster and put it into a game pulling it from the cultural context.<br/><br/>Judging by the discussion, all three of these things may be happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lemon" title="lemon"><img alt="lemon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lemon">lemon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375194/#Comment_375194" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T13:27:09+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  1:27PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Parthenia</cite>Lemon, that's a really bad example, so I want to clarify something.

(Ideally somebody who has at some point called SOMETHING racist, so you know they recognize the existence of the concept.) If you don't know anybody like that, well, finding somebody like that is probably an important part of respectfully writing such a game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375204/#Comment_375204" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T13:44:18+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  1:44PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/jogesh">@jogesh</a>  - thanks, that was actually useful                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375208/#Comment_375208" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T13:54:15+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  1:54PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>To that end, I think it'd be great if this "cultural appropriation" thread were to lead to a conversation about how to respectfully design games that use cultural touchstones and that explore cultures outside "your own."</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I'm working on a post talking about MRG with this in mind, on Matthew SB's request.

That's how global hegemony "works".<br/>Linde himself puts it like this:<br/>"We don\u2019t have the same history here in Sweden of slavery, of colonialist oppression. Our colonies were barely there. We don\u2019t have the \u2018guilt quilt\u2019 big colonialist nations have, and yet we\u2019re constantly asked to relate to the same issues of slavery and segregation that, say, the United States does. It\u2019s as if our race relations are imported from the US, and the whole issue becomes almost a meta- or quasi-discussion."</blockquote>\nOkay, so because Linde, a man of African descent and a Swedish national, is allowed to use images (with immunity from racism) of golliwogs, black face, and Sarah Baartman charicatures--negative images of people of African descent, be they Ghanan, US, or Swedish nationals--because Sweden never had slavery or colonial oppression? Bullshit. They certainly benefitted from it. Swedes benefit from white privilege. The whole cake debacle is a perfect example of it. Linde benefitted from Swedish white privilege. <br/><br/>The US did not infect the world with racism or poor race relations. Racism isn't a thing we made up to oppress the people we needed to oppress. These images travelled the globe, and not all of them derived from American media. They're hurtful and racist wherever they go, regardless of whoever uses them. If my husband, a Swedish citizen decided to draw a picture of me using <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Baartman.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a> as a model, he'd be in a lot of trouble, yes, but the image wouldn't be any less hurtful, just because he grew up among "enlightened" Quakers and Swedes. <br/><br/>When I was in Japan, I found no end of images of black people depicted as sub-human apelike jigaboos. It was a thing, briefly, in the 80's in Japan. It was racist. It didn't hurt any less than if I'd encountered those images in the US. The branding of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlie" rel="nofollow">Darkie Toothpaste</a>, even though it's now called Darlie toothpaste and it's only sold in China, Malaysia, and Indonesia, is still racist branding.<br/><br/>"We didn't know!" and "It didn't happen here!" is not an excuse. Once you know and you keep engaging it (both racism and cultural appropriation), you're complicit, if not a full participant. This applies to game design and the misuse of culture and negative images.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375217/#Comment_375217" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T14:12:39+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  2:12PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 2:13PM by Wordman.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lemon</cite>This thread is positively dripping with American privilege and assumptions.</blockquote>\nAs an American, I object to cultural appropriation because it appropriates my culture.

But the example reads to me like someone being <i>prejudiced</i>, not racist. <br/><br/>And it is important to note that <i>plain truth</i> may be confused with prejudice too; <b>if</b> indigenous people are, in fact, closer to nature than whites ...<br/>- then <i>saying</i> that they indeed are so, is not prejudice, nor racism; it would be to state a fact.<br/><br/>To refute the plain truth with stubborn prejudices is something that occurs very often. That is the reason I ask for examples here; discussing from examples has more merit, as all we say have to be held up against the facts we have found. I have not seen racism in any of the facts disclosed here so far, but prejudice.

This is unacceptable behavior. You are asking people of color and/or their allies to educate you. You are putting the burden of education from yourself and onto them. If you honestly want to know more about cultural appropriation and racism, then get off this roleplaying game forum and <a href="http://whitepriv.blogspot.com/2010/02/10-ways-to-be-and-ally.html" rel="nofollow">start doing some research</a>. (Edit: and if they choose to answer you, that is their prerogative, but that does not make it any more fair of you to ask.)<br/><br/>You cannot understand racism experienced by a person of another race. No number of examples or facts or citations can fully give you the experience. If you really want to, you can argue out of any example, pointing to intent or ignorance or anecdotes of some person you met who told you a story about their life (and who knows if that person was expressing internalized racism to you or not). There is no checklist that if you do or don't do *these things* then racism will be solved. (Actually there is, it's one item and it could be summed up as: "Treat every person as a complete human being and ask nothing from them" but that tells us very little about methods to change the structures that already exist)<br/><br/>I'm not calling you a racist or anything of the sort. This is not a social justice forum, and we stumble into these discussions rather clumsily, so it's perfectly understandable to find ourselves in over our heads. I'm sure I'm guilty of this too (maybe even my previous post). I'm not claiming you're alone in this, and I might be singling you out unfairly when others may be doing it. I just happened to notice this cycle from you in this thread, and pigeon publicly mentioning some regret in engaging with you. <br/><br/>What I am telling you is that if you are interested in educating yourself more about racism and being an ally against racism, then stop asking people of color to educate you and do the work yourself.<br/><br/>You've been asking for examples, then you get them, and then ask more questions for those examples. This is <a href="http://derailingfordummies.com/education.html" rel="nofollow">derailing for education</a>. Please stop.<br/><br/>The <a href="http://derailingfordummies.com/" rel="nofollow">Derailing for Dummies</a> is a generally helpful website (if dripping with sarcasm) if you want to start educating yourself. It won't give you all the answers. It probably won't even tell you the answers you want to know (such as when cultural appropriation consitutes racism). This work is hard and will require you to deconstruct yourself and your assumptions and the ways you think and respond to your own emotions. There are no quick and easy answers.<br/><br/>I also want to make it clear that if you need more links, I am more than happy to provide them. Please whisper me if you hit a dead end - I will do what I can to get you unblocked. I am offering what little experience and knowledge I have to help you expand your resources, if you ever feel the need to desire for it.<br/><br/>*Even if you are Jewish or another oppressed culture or race in your own country, or have experienced it, you cannot fully know what people of another culture are experiencing.

Thank you! Sorry I did not see them before.<br/><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite>* "Native American names." There are quite a few games that tell you to make up a Native American name "like Walks With Tree or Dances With Wolves." Sometimes they say "be cliche" or "stereotypical." Unsurprisingly, this is stereotypical, and immediately puts the most hackneyed ideas about Native Americans into your head. It's also not typically all that accurate -- there are lots and lots of Native American tribes with different naming conventions. You guys must've heard of Hiawatha, at least. I'll be honest and say I don't know enough about Native American naming traditions and social customs to talk about this indefinitely, but I'm confident that naming everybody Stands With a Fist is pretty disrespectful.</blockquote>Why? The one indian I have met, was a dakota chieftain called "Proud Eagle". He was a very engaging and wise man, more into teaching his own people and others of his old culture, than lamenting the past. I would expect him to be proud of having young kids (even white kids) playing characters with names like his own, making the "indian" into the hero of the narrative.<br/><br/>That aside; telling people to be stereotypical or cliche, is sound advice in all improvisation, as it enables players to take their preconceptions (good or badly founded) into the game, and contribute without being afraid of what they say. It is simple and good advice for gaming.<br/><br/>So; where's the<i>racism</i>in that?<br/><br/>Telling people to make up fake Native American names, in order to play a game relating to Native American traditions, is diminishing -- it more or less directly tells people who read the game that it isn't worth actually knowing things about Native American culture, their naming traditions (different from European ones), and such, but rather that you should just fake it and nobody will notice or care. This tells people that Native American culture and heritage isn't important -- isn't worth knowing about. It tells Native Americans who read the game that the game writer doesn't know anything about their culture, doesn't care that the names people come up with playing the game will sound false and weird to them -- it says that their culture isn't valued by the game designer, and that everybody who says the game is great or that they loved playing it feels the same way. It trains them to treat their own heritage with distance and disrespect in order to fit into the world around them, cutting themselves off from their own past and their parents and grandparents in order to do so. It does so in the context of a society (or, yes, Eurocentric cultural hegemony) that has already spent hundreds of years attempting to marginalize and erase Native American culture, telling these Native Americans that even in games or other things they might do to avoid dealing with their lives, there is no escape from the pressure to disrespect their culture in order to get along with others. It forms part of an overarching structure which, whether intentionally or not, tells people of color that they'd be better off being white, and attempts to, as much as is feasible, erase all non-dominant cultures from the face of the Earth.<br/><br/>I hope that clarifies my position.

Your prejudice is in "plain truth" of whatever definition of "closer to nature" that you've decided upon as "fact." <br/><br/>Is it the closer to nature of a land speculator that wants cheap but commercially valuable land (perhaps with a view)? Is it closer to nature of a lumberjack, that may want to cull the right trees to keep a forest healthy? A hunter, that wants healthy prey species populations? An environmentalist that wants to ensure healthy ecosystems, air, and water? A banker that wants closely accessible protected parks for vacationing in?<br/><br/>And then once we've decided upon the type of data we want, what about the facts that we ignore? Do we ignore waste and fighting and slaughter because "every human culture has that"? Are we going off stories or anecdotes? Do we study a culture for 1 year, 10 years, 100 years? How much information is enough to conclusively prove our hypothesis that a given indigenous culture is closer to nature? How do we objectively measure this closeness? How do we track the information that we don't know? What's the mathematical model our plain truth is based on? Did we stop looking for more answers because we because we ran out of time/energy/funding/political/information sources?<br/><br/>I can tell you. We've done this for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. In the past, mythologies about other cultures were pretty easy to refute because they were based on very little more than hearsay and an antagonistic attitude. As we got more sophisticated, so did our stories. In the 19th century, there were "proofs" for the superiority of the white race and the inferiority of all others, and these were discussed and lauded in respectable society. We now have much more data and understanding. Which means that our prejudices are much harder to refute and uncover. <br/><br/>But we can look at the trend line. And the trend line is this: there are no differences between one human or another that are so insurmountable as to make them alien to ourselves. There are no qualitative measurements that can prove one aspect of a culture is better than another. But what is valuable is the differences, and respecting and caring for each other because we have differences. This is a completely prejudiced point of view. But I choose it because it motivates me to deconstruct my own culture which told me that is was the greatest, freest and best culture in the world. I don't want to believe that anymore because I don't believe it is true.<br/><br/>There is nothing of the human mind or perception that can be fully scrubbed of prejudice. The best we can do is remove the ones that cause us to put other people into categories while still giving people the freedom to categorize themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375242/#Comment_375242" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T15:06:55+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  3:06PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 3:08PM by UserClone.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone needs a more specific example, I can give one straight out of my game. I didn't realize I was appropriating at the time, but I definitely was. I completely failed with the whole "Coyote as trickster" litmus test, and I apologize to anyone that it may have potentially hurt (had anyone beyond my four reviewers read it):<br/><br/>After that scene wraps up, whomever had been Narrating should pass the book<br/>to the player on her left, who becomes the new narrator.<br/>The new Narrator need not read any further in the book itself, but should portray<br/>Coyote as a mysterious trickster spirit. Coyote is only as malicious or genuinely<br/>helpful as the current Narrator decides he will be. The Narrator must frame and<br/>lead a scene in which the children and Coyote interact while continuing on their<br/>journey towards the next Task, and ultimately, the Lantern of Revealing which will<br/>guide them home. When the Narrator and the other players feel ready to move on,<br/>the Narrator should utter once again the ritual phrase:<br/>\u201c...and Coyote cast the Bones...\u201d [This is the phrase in my game which means it's time to roll dice. - JL]<br/>Ready to begin, Narrator?<br/>Great! All you have to do, strictly speaking, is to either read or paraphrase the<br/>italicized text. However, it's helpful to the mood of this game if you try to imagine yourself in<br/>a wild and forested land where a heavy mist covers the land in secrecy and mystery...<br/>You awake to find yourselves in a forest glade. The grass is soft and moist beneath your feet and<br/>the misty air smells of leaves, grass and earth. Looking around, you soon discover that this glade is<br/>surrounded not only by trees, but an impenetrable fog that obscures all vision beyond twenty feet or so.<br/>Suddenly, out of the mists there comes wild, reckless laughter. A moment later, a spirit appears<br/>in your midst. Its long, serpentine body seems to be made of the very vapors from which it has emerged.<br/>Black claws extend from each of its six hands as it steadies itself in the limbs of a nearby tree. From<br/>behind its canine mask, it addresses you as a group:<br/>\u201cGreetings, children of Man, I am called Coyote. How foolish of you to have come here! This is<br/>no place for children, none at all. In this place dwell dark secrets and fevered dreams. Here are the<br/>desperate hopes and the deepest fears of a parent whose child has gone missing. However, you cannot<br/>go back home again. At least that is, not until you have discovered for yourselves the Lantern of<br/>Revealing, the magical artifact which lights the way to freedom.<br/>\u201dWhat do you mean, what is that? The Lantern is something different for everyone who comes<br/>here. There's no telling what form it may take, or what it may want in exchange for its power.<br/>\u201cMake no mistake. You are all now in the gravest of danger, that of being Forgotten by the<br/>world from which you came. You must complete the Tasks. You must travel far. You must give of<br/>yourselves if you are all going to make it out of this world and back to the one where you belong. Once<br/>you have traveled far and completed your Tasks, you will have reached the apex of the mountain, and<br/>thus you will find the Lantern of Revealing which lies at the peak.\u201d<br/>The spirit lets this all sink in. Realizing as you all must do that you really have no choice in the<br/>matter, unless you wish to become a permanent part of some dark other realm, you gesture for Coyote<br/>to lead the way.<br/>Soon enough, your guide gestures for you all to stop. It seems to sense something deeper in the<br/>fog that your vision can penetrate. A growing dread grips your chest.<br/>\u201c...and Coyote cast the Bones...\u201d                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lemon" title="lemon"><img alt="lemon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lemon">lemon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375244/#Comment_375244" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T15:08:42+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  3:08PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 3:10PM by lemon.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Parthenia</cite>Linde is a Swedish man of African descent who believes Sweden didn't benefit from slavery.</blockquote>\nI don't know what to tell you, that's not what Linde is saying, and it's not what I'm saying.

If the fact of the matter is that a real estate broker is closer to nature than, say; a ballerina (and that the fact may be convincingly argued), then stating it is no prejudice. Of course; you may find a nice example of a ballerina perfectly in tune with nature, showing that your <i>general</i> truth not always applies on an <i>individual</i> level.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jogesh EZ</cite><b>ThomasHVM, please stop this right now.</b>You are derailing. This is unacceptable behavior.</blockquote>Jogesh; please take heed. I'm stating my meanings here, with arguments I stand ready to defend, if need be. That is NOT "unacceptable behavior". To say so will not help the discussion.<br/><br/>To the actual points:<br/><br/>- you claim that I ask someone to educate me. I do not. I ask people who claim racism is going on, to give us examples, and arguments based on actual examples. That is not me asking for "education"; it is a wish to discuss real issues.<br/><br/>- you claim that I cannot understand racism experienced by a person of another race. We can all understand, to a certain degree; how humiliating it is, how hard it is to escape, how bloody painful it is to see your little sister being subjected to it, how shocking it must be to discover that your father has been imbued with shame over his origins, and so forth. It's called <i>empathy</i>. I prefer to go with <i>empathy</i> in these questions, rather than sympathy. I understand your suffering, and the reasons for it, but I do not share your feelings. Your experience is your own. I do not walk in your shoes. <br/><i>(except, maybe, in a really great role-playing game)</i><br/><br/>It is indeed perfectly understandable to find ourselves in over our heads. Please understand that lashing out like you do, Jogesh, as if I am a bad person some way (by consent between you and pidgeon, obviously), I see it as YOU plunging in too deep; you try to make it personal. That is not good. You loose sight of the issue here, Jogesh. <br/><br/>But as you make a point of discussing me, as a person, I will answer you in kind;<br/>- I am a white man, 50, partly sami, all working class. I were subjected to 12 years of hell at school back in the 60s and 70s, and coming out of it with scars that made me realize not all humans are good. I've done some research on the sami-people in Norway, talking with both friends and strangers on their origins and personal history, and have found scars aplenty there, shame, silence, anger, bitterness, alcoholism, hopelessness ... <br/>- even when most Norwegians believe the scars of racist policy to be healed. <br/><br/>My personal history with this kind of issues, and related ones, is long and painful.<br/><br/>And still I claim that you have to see <i>prejudice</i> as one thing, and <i>racism</i> as another, and to go for <i>the truth</i> all the time, or go for<i> the heart</i> of what people are saying, all the time, tirelessly. It makes for a more complex reality, and one that is harder to understand and act in, and that may be hard to accept. In part it includes accepting people as fallible, and prejudiced, and with ideas that hurts you in the telling. It is very tempting to go for easy solutions in such a world, or to block our unwanted truths. But in my experience easy solutions are far from effective; they create more scars and more resentment, and more conflict. <br/><br/>Complex thinking and friendly communication will make the truth spring out more often. And even provocation; having a game provoking a debate like this can be very benevolent for the people involved. We get to set things straight, and to put words to more than one side of an issue. Facing the truths, including how people rage about this issue, is the best way forward, for all.<br/><br/>So please, Jogesh; lay down the sledgehammer and accept that others may have some nuggets of insight to share too. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_375253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375253/#Comment_375253" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T15:20:04+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  3:20PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 3:21PM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Deleted                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375257/#Comment_375257" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T15:23:21+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  3:23PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots to digest in this thread, and it's an interesting discussion. I'm only going to involve myself in this discussion because my game borrows from many cultures, including Native American, European and Chinese. I wrote "Last Chance to Tell the Tale of Coyote and Medicine Man."<br/><br/>The ingredient "Coyote" certainly caught my attention and when combined with "Doctor (medicine man)" informed my game. I even used character creation where the players make up a name like "Walks With A Heavy Foot." I called it a "mythological name." On top of that, I tried to create a game where the players made stories that sound similar to what you might hear during a native story telling convention. And, I added a fire to sit around to tell the stories (outdoor camping culture). I mixed this into a story-telling parlor game (European tradition) with shadow puppets (Chinese).<br/><br/>Therefore, my game might be racist if we follow many of the arguments in this thread...<br/><br/>I think it's important to make a distinction here:<br/><br/>1. There's a different between using cultural mythology (especially from a repressed and almost exterminated culture) in a respectful way with sensitivity,<br/><br/>and <br/><br/>2. Using cultural mythology to force a point that you want to make. I.e. Native American's as Orcs who piss on each other as a mating ritual.<br/><br/>So, let's say that I have Native American blood (which I do). Let's say that I've been invited to tell stories at story telling conventions (which I have). Let's say that I've studied Native American cultures in college (which I did). Let's say I studied for awhile with a shaman (which I have). Let's keep on saying all this stuff and more which is true, then does that make any game I make okay?<br/><br/>Only if 1 is true, and I believe it is. So, if anyone wants to say otherwise, I'd love to hear it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375263/#Comment_375263" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T15:26:12+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  3:26PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 3:27PM by Todd_L.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a lot of boilerplate <span style="color: #0000FF;">social justice</span> rhetoric flying around in here.

I got a lot of different and really useful examples of that in the thread, thank you! That was me doing a bit of research for my game, a game on cultural clashes between humans and orcs (not indians). I got a lot of inspiration from other sources too, especially my knowledge of how the the sami people were treated.<br/><br/>But then I got some more in the said thread (predictably, I see now); when I stated that I wanted to use this for inspiration in a game of humans conquering orcs, I was (wrongly) accused of making indians into demi-humans. The lack of sensitivity was on the parties that intensely argued that I did so, in spite of me telling them that I had no intention at all of portraying indians in my game. The main idea of the game was to focus on how a conquering party can justify their actions, by demonizing the culture of the indigenous race. I tried to argue this repeatedly, but the point was ignored/missed by most in the thread, and as a consequence it slid into a undignified slug-fest of blame and hurt. <br/><br/>It often happens in threads like these; the hurt is too close to the surface, resulting in rage and resentment blossoming, rather than common sense and investigation of the facts at hand. I regret that, but see it as unavoidable. There is no easy way out of a conflict like this. <br/><br/>The ones with most hurt have to cry, and swear, and be mad at the "cold" people. <br/><br/>And the ones with no inkling of how hard it has been, how unfair and total the repression has been, have to read the reactions as a release of pain, and a claim for just restitution.<br/><br/>No easy way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jeffr" title="jeffr"><img alt="jeffr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jeffr">jeffr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375279/#Comment_375279" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T15:50:23+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  3:50PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see the war on straw is still in full swing...<br/><br/>(There are, in fact, scores of possible objections to the 'anti-racist' position that are not, in fact, pro-racist.

It deals only with your own idea of the construct of "close to nature" and nothing at all with the people you are talking about. Your attempt to dress it up in the language of objectivity makes it worse, because it is the same discourse that has been used to justify genocide over and over again. The actual words are specifically part of the narrative of what constituted proper use of agricultural land that allowed European settlers to feel good about claiming the whole continent for themselves, after ethnically cleansing it with technology and disease.<br/><br/>Really, the cake thing is a surprisingly good example: we're talking about a performative art object in which people in positions of power (both in real life and in the fiction) inflict symbolic violence on caricatures of people of colour, while being encouraged by the person role-playing the victim ("asking for it" if you will). Afterwards, when someone challenges you, can just say you were trying to "raise awareness" or "educate myself".<br/><br/>If you want an objective truth: that black woman is not very representative of the women suffering genital mutilation, just as "Indian names" aren't representative of indigenous North American peoples.

But you're right, in this case it's probably at least partially due to coyote being an ingredient this year. I don't agree that all appropriation is bad though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375378/#Comment_375378" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T22:31:55+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 10:31PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2012 5:32AM by Todd_L.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD Corley,<br/><br/>I am not sure you &amp; I are talking about the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">social justice</span>.<br/><br/>Do I recall correctly that you're an attorney?  ...I fully support that type of social justice.<br/><br/><br/>The type I'm finding fault with is <span style="color: #0000FF;">the cultish internet meme version</span>, where a link to derailing-for-dummies, or throwaway slogans like Check Your Privilege, or It's Not Their Job To Educate You-- are used to avoid two-way interaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375381/#Comment_375381" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T22:58:08+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 10:58PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe I'm outta line here, but I think some threads on, y'know, <i>actual game design</i> concerning these issues would be fuckin' dope.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_375389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375389/#Comment_375389" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T23:56:12+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 11:56PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>If anyone needs a more specific example, I can give one straight out of my game.

It's an evocative text, obviously using the Coyote spirit figure, and that figure is obviously taken from indian myths. And used by you, as you see fit to your game. But so what?<br/><br/>I suppose we are talking about a context where indian culture is largely misrepresented in the US, in entertainment and art, and where that misrepresentation is felt as a continual reopening of the scars made by history. Victims thinking "it was/is not like that, they don't see me/us, they don't care", and being right in that sentiment. <br/><br/>I can see that as a bad praxis, and hurtful. And if it is like this, it certainly explains why the reaction is so fervent. But surely; the text at hand is not claiming to "sweeten" anything related to history, and it is not representing indians in any way. That makes the claims of bad "appropriation" rest solely on the single fact that the game-smith is using Coyote to inspire a spirit-figure of his game. <br/><br/>As seen from my point of view, that is a pretty innocent thing to do, the way it is done in the cited text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375390/#Comment_375390" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T00:01:45+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 12:01AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well the way I see it, it was pretty shitty to just decide to snap up a piece of vaguely native american lore and decide to throw it in my game with absolutely zero research or consideration of the source material.

Including that in the interaction, by various means, is paramount when trying to be true to the repercussions of violence or repression. And it is followed up by the premise that the players act as advocates for their characters, trying their best to avoid being violated, or trying their best to justify their own brutality (if they choose to go down that path). They do not "ask for it", but have agreed to play the game as is, and to seek their insights and/or fun by doing so. It may sound strange to you, but I find it very interesting to play such games, on themes ranging from ordinary friendship and death, to the grand epic of cultures clashing (and one culture playing the supreme hand of victor in the aftermath). \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: adamwb</cite>Afterwards, when someone challenges you, can just say you were trying to "raise awareness" or "educate myself".</blockquote>I've been challenged time and again, and so have lots of others. But; although I see why some people get offended by certain themes, I have yet to see anyone make a convincing argument against the praxis of playing realistic and emotionally engaging scenarios. <br/><br/>People are basically reacting to serious themes surfacing in role-playing games, as if rpgs are best kept as some form of silly childrens play, and not something grown ups may use for more serious game-play.<br/><br/>Role-playing games <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> educating, on so many levels, and they may certainly raise awareness. But they do this so much better if the games take heed of all elements that may be present in a real conflict, and give the players the means to represent these elements with realism in the interaction. Working with realism in games demands a certain finesse, and a large pool of effective game-tools. To have people react badly to your <i>actual game</i> (not your postings about it), is a signal that you have failed, possibly by ignoring some of the challenges inherent in the chosen theme, or not handling them well. You have to meet the challenges head on, with tools that make the players interact in ways that lets them see the heart of the conflict, to make such a game any good. It is a great challenge. And pursuing it as a designer is sure to create controversy around you.<br/><br/>I do these kind of games as a professional designer, and my games stand or fall with the quality of my work, as do all other games. But games like these fall the harder, when they fail, as they purport to create fiction inspired and informed by real life, and with real life experiences as their final measurement of worth. In some cases making such a game is a steep climb for a designer.<br/><br/>Still; these games are games for adults, and should be treated as serious art on important human conditions, both in play and in discussion. I find that this discussion has elements of that, and that makes it worth the while.

Did you see my response?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I do not want young designers of today go into gaming with the idea that no serious themes may be explored, due to it automatically being "appropriative" or "racist" or "insensitive".</blockquote>\nSee, I give young designers a lot more credit than that. I think they're perfectly capable of exploring "serious" themes in a respectful way, and I encourage them to do so. I think it should be obvious from the games I have written that I'm a big fan of both serious themes and people of color in gaming, and that's definitely what I want to see. I would never assert that young designers should go ahead and be racist in order to write good games, because that's kind of a serious ding on their level of creativity.<br/><br/>But also, I think younger people are likely to be less racist and sexist than older people, and to be more aware of its existence. I think most young people would never ask "Where's the racism?" because a lot of them already know. So I'm not really concerned about that.

I am advocating that we do not need to take that as serious all the time, especially when participating in a competition with minimum amount of time to do reseach, but I do not advice designers to make serious games on themes they have no inkling about.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>So I want to end this discussion, on my part</blockquote><p>Tomas, the best way to end the discussion on your part is to shut up.</p>Me? Shreyas; that is not me you are quoting! And more; please say something on the issue. That is always better.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Nice of you to give us some examples, Liam. Thank you! Sorry I did not see them before.<br/><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite>* "Native American names." There are quite a few games that tell you to make up a Native American name "like Walks With Tree or Dances With Wolves." Sometimes they say "be cliche" or "stereotypical." Unsurprisingly, this is stereotypical, and immediately puts the most hackneyed ideas about Native Americans into your head. It's also not typically all that accurate -- there are lots and lots of Native American tribes with different naming conventions. You guys must've heard of Hiawatha, at least. I'll be honest and say I don't know enough about Native American naming traditions and social customs to talk about this indefinitely, but I'm confident that naming everybody Stands With a Fist is pretty disrespectful.</blockquote>Why? The one indian I have met, was a dakota chieftain called "Proud Eagle". He was a very engaging and wise man, more into teaching his own people and others of his old culture, than lamenting the past. I would expect him to be proud of having young kids (even white kids) playing characters with names like his own, making the "indian" into the hero of the narrative.<br/><br/>That aside; telling people to be stereotypical or cliche, is sound advice in all improvisation, as it enables players to take their preconceptions (good or badly founded) into the game, and contribute without being afraid of what they say. It is simple and good advice for gaming.<br/><br/>So; where's the<i>racism</i>in that?<br/><br/>Telling people to make up fake Native American names, in order to play a game relating to Native American traditions, is diminishing -- it more or less directly tells people who read the game that it isn't worth actually knowing things about Native American culture, their naming traditions (different from European ones), and such, but rather that you should just fake it and nobody will notice or care. This tells people that Native American culture and heritage isn't important -- isn't worth knowing about. It tells Native Americans who read the game that the game writer doesn't know anything about their culture, doesn't care that the names people come up with playing the game will sound false and weird to them -- it says that their culture isn't valued by the game designer, and that everybody who says the game is great or that they loved playing it feels the same way. It trains them to treat their own heritage with distance and disrespect in order to fit into the world around them, cutting themselves off from their own past and their parents and grandparents in order to do so. It does so in the context of a society (or, yes, Eurocentric cultural hegemony) that has already spent hundreds of years attempting to marginalize and erase Native American culture, telling these Native Americans that even in games or other things they might do to avoid dealing with their lives, there is no escape from the pressure to disrespect their culture in order to get along with others. It forms part of an overarching structure which, whether intentionally or not, tells people of color that they'd be better off being white, and attempts to, as much as is feasible, erase all non-dominant cultures from the face of the Earth.<br/><br/>I hope that clarifies my position. It does! Sorry I missed this one!<br/><br/>I see where you come from, but I do not agree with all you say. You put too much weight on players making up names for their characters, if playing something inspired by indian culture. Making up names is a normal thing to do in rpgs. <br/><br/>You have a lot of things to say about how badly indians are treated in your society, and I believe you, and agree with your description of how this is done and what the negative effects are ...<br/>- but to me you fail to make the connection between that, and the examples taken from the simple games we are debating. You fail to convince me that the examples are part of the racist system you describe. So I believe we have to agree in disagreeing, and let it rest.<br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375446/#Comment_375446" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T08:55:46+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  8:55AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>This doesn't exist.

Politically correct human rights posturing is practically the only topic at Story Games where it's lauded as correct behaviour to be rude, superficial, dogmatic and hostile towards other people because they have the wrong opinions, or even simply because they don't have the right opinions hard enough (or whatever, I haven't quite figured out how you guys choose your targets here). Perhaps you're correct in that nobody is silencing anybody, but that depends on your social standards - I for one feel no particular need to engage these discussions, for they fall well short of the usual standards. So perhaps there's no literal <i>silencing</i> here, just a strong wish from fellow forumites to keep your mouth shut unless you're 100% on the party train or particularly enjoy being chewed on.<br/><br/>The above can be read in plainer terms as a defense of offensive statements, insofar as you consider any statement that doesn't immediately, uncritically and unconditionally accept your thesis to be offensive. Maybe it's even an offensive statement in itself, at least that's the subtext I get from the terse and/or rude replies people are getting from e.g. Shreyas, Elizabeth, Julia. All these discussion strategies like aggressively dismissing what others are saying because their train of thought can be found in your debate guide - they're below the belt, frankly. Is it more important to be loudly correct or to be understood by the people you are engaging? At least for my part, the general behaviour regarding this topic at Story Games has made me think that I well might be a racist and a sexist in the anglo sense of these terms, because clearly I don't agree with the modes of thinking advocated by the people who most loudly complain about these matters. If the only way to be respectful of others and to seek for objective truth in the world is to be a rich white male exercising privilege, then pass me the club jacket if you please.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375466/#Comment_375466" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T09:59:36+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  9:59AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>At least for my part, the general behaviour regarding this topic at Story Games has made me think that I well might be a racist and a sexist in the anglo sense of these terms, because clearly I don't agree with the modes of thinking advocated by the people who most loudly complain about these matters.

If I lie to be understood, am I really helping anyone? Even myself?<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with someone saying a statement is or isn't offensive in some way, but Todd's perspective, that anyone even asking the question has already disqualified their opinion from being considered because they are concerned with colored social justice, is so laughably wrong that merely wrong people would look on in embarrassment and mutter that they aren't <i>that</i> bad.<br/><br/>Like, Todd's not saying "I disagree, it's fine to take this specific piece of native culture in this way and here's why", he's saying "because you are concerned with whether it is right or wrong, nothing you say matters, why don't we ask people who don't care if it's fine or not if it's fine".  Spoiler alert: people who don't care about social justice are always going to say it doesn't matter, whatever you do is fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375478/#Comment_375478" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T10:22:21+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 10:22AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not rudeness, Liam, but rather the quality of discourse. Your demand of immediate and total acceptance of your truths mostly brings to mind the kind of old communist youth discourses we got in the '70s here in Finland - either buckle under the social pressure or be our enemy, for right now is the moment to choose your sides and not at all a moment of leisurely discourse like it seems from the environs. (I mean, you people are throwing offensive remarks like you had an audience of demonstrators to play to here; did we stumble in the middle of political action without noticing?) That's not a good place to be in discourse, it's difficult to be on the receiving end and take that as anything but propaganda. A reasonable person with truth on their side would define their terms, point out the issues, lay out their argument and come to a substantial conclusion of some sort. As it is, I can't even have this discussion, not to speak of having an opportunity to be convinced. After all, I should already have done my homework, so if I disagree it's because I'm either evil or lazy-stupid.<br/><br/>But also, to be evenhanded, I agree with your evaluation: I am probably not an useful contributor in your crusade. It seems like you need people who live in the USA and who are more into extreme action and less into truth-seeking. Happy with it or not, one would need to live the life of an American civil rights crusader to think like one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375482/#Comment_375482" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T10:34:11+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 10:34AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see what you're saying, Jason.

So what is going on here, I guess, is that you're both reading each other as trying to dismiss the opposing point of view, while you yourself are merely defending the valid right of your own to be heard.<br/><br/>I mean, gutcheck: I'd be extremely surprised if Todd came out in the next post and told us that yeah, he thinks that racism is A-OK.

What he and Tomas (and myself, to be frank) think about this topic seems to be mostly that it requires careful consideration and critical thinking to balance virtues like intellectual curiousity and freedom of expression of thought against other virtues such as acknowledging cultural pride and minority rights activism. They're not saying that these things do not matter, they're just asking to see the work, as we used to say in the math department.<br/><br/>Then again, for all I know Todd might be extremely familiar with all this discourse from other places, which might be making him a bit exasperated. Story Games is the only place where I see this stuff, but the accountrements are all very similar to other echo chamber ideologies I've seen all over the Internet and the real world. I'd love to learn more about American thinking on social justice, but the only thing I'm learning in this thread (and earlier threads on the same topics) is that you need to agree or shut up, for only the people who actually belong in the oppressed groups under discussion have a right to dictate opinion on these matters.

Story Games is the only place where I see this stuff, but the accountrements are all very similar to other echo chamber ideologies I've seen all over the Internet and the real world. I'd love to learn more about American thinking on social justice, but the only thing I'm learning in this thread (and earlier threads on the same topics) is that you need to agree or shut up, for only the people who actually belong in the oppressed groups under discussion have a right to dictate opinion on these matters.

The only topics where I see people telling others to shut up and get out of the thread are ones about social politics (and the occasional random thread with Shreyas or Jason being an asshole, I guess), and it's always the presumed liberal (or at least, socially authoritarian) side of the discussion that acts like this. Could be that I'm missing some nuances, but to me this discussion, as well as the earlier ones, seem like they're about a politically dogmatic majority bullying people who are stupid enough to not keep silent or agree vocally with the sentiment.<br/><br/>I try to be sympathetic myself, though, and I think that I can sort of get the amount of frustration and excited belief that people bring to this topic. Is it something that's taught to you from a young age, so that seeing somebody not immediately agree with the symbols of the ideology brings up instant despisement and a feeling of superiority? (That might sound bitchy, but I'm honestly curious - those are the kinds of psychological reactions people get when they have an opportunity to preach at the less enlightened.)<br/><br/>In comparison to the American situation, race relations and such are much less complex and pressing as a political topic here in Finland. I freely admit that I don't understand the excited and dogmatic attitudes that come up. Sort of like everybody's afraid that KKK will conquer the forums if we don't have periodic cleansing sessions. From my viewpoint the racism thing takes a back-seat and I only see people in the grip of ideological fervour, which is a much more important matter of mental hygiene around here than social justice. (My country is pretty much a monoculture in comparison to USA, there's no need for me to have an opinion towards any direction on social justice.)<br/><br/>If anybody wants to tell a bit more about the backgrounds of this discussion, I'd love to hear about it. I mean, I know intellectually about the historical topics of civil rights movement in the USA and so on, but I've never thought about what it looks like on the ground level for the people. Are you folks very active in the civil rights movement, for example? Do you often encounter people who are actually racist? Do you treat these types of discussions face to face the same way you act here? I've no idea about these sorts of things, which surely makes this entirely topic seem as weird as it does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375498/#Comment_375498" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T11:35:23+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 11:35AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it possible, Eero, that your perception of what's rude and dogmatic, and also what's actually the majority opinion, are informed by your own perspective?

The hobby as a whole has had a terrible history with regard to minority representation and cultural appropriation; but a lot of it is inadvertent, brought on by simple ignorance or lack of awareness. Consciousness needs to be raised.</blockquote>\nI think there are some great points here from posters (Shreyas, Elizabeth, Liam, etc) that have vigorously argued for a deeper exploration of cultural appropriation, both why it happens and how it affects those who are appropriated.  I think there are also a number of posters who have engaged in the kind of denial of privilege (and/or demand that we stick to the "objective truth") that can be really frustrating for those of us who care about the ways in which dominant culture silences the voices of less privileged people.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, this is the conversation we need to have as a community. Thank you, Meserach, for making it a part of the forum; it was a real pleasure reading it. Thanks also to people who participated here in good faith; you reaffirm to me that the internet can be a great place to spread messages of tolerance and respect, a vehicle for <span style="color: #0000FF;">social justice</span>. Our community/industry needs to have a more inclusive attitude that can only arise from exactly this discussion.<br/><br/>In the future, I hope we think about how Game Chef, as a representation of the story game community, can avoid encouraging cultural appropriation.  There are obvious lines that the contest doesn't cross: I doubt that anyone would approve "rape" as an element for use in the contest for exactly the reasons people have discussed. It's hard to do a topic justice in a week.<br/><br/>So I think we can all do a better job of thinking about where that line should be drawn. I think, to some degree, this relies on all of us to be a little critical of what we are proposing by looking through the lenses we do have available.  I know, as a Mexican-American, that the elements "tamale, sombrero, and illegal immigrants" would raise red flags for me, and I would feel empowered to bring those issues up to the Game Chef staff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375510/#Comment_375510" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T11:58:33+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 11:58AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>Is it possible, Eero, that your perception of what's rude and dogmatic, and also what's actually the majority opinion, are informed by your own perspective? </blockquote>\nAre you sure it's the majority opinion?

Good! The whole point is to make these issues, and these voices, and these feelings, impossible to ignore.<br/><br/>If white people skeptical about social justice are feeling silenced, well, they're welcome to go to any of the eighty billion places where the views of skeptical white people are praised with enthusiasm. It's a whole wide internet, and forum, out there, and surprisingly enough nearly all of it is incredibly accommodating to white people saying whatever they want, especially if they couch their positions as reasonable and moderate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375528/#Comment_375528" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T12:30:42+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 12:30PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>Is it possible, Eero, that your perception of what's rude and dogmatic, and also what's actually the majority opinion, are informed by your own perspective?

I have this strong suspicion that what I'm seeing here is the outcome of different life experiences and not some sort of fundamental lack of compassion that it's painted out to be. People are mostly similar to each other rather than different, I have no need to believe that I wouldn't agree on the substantial issues if they were actually discussed instead of this whatever this is - ideological purity committee meeting?<br/><br/>Or, to say the same thing in a different way: what would you think if I told you that every American on this board needs to accord immediately and completely with the anarcho-syndicalist program for preventing privatization of environmental properties? And if you don't know what I'm talking about, then that's your fault. And if you don't see how your gaming is trampling my political sensibilities then that's because you're unwilling to be part of the solution. And anyway, if you basically post in my thread about it in less than agreeable light, that's because you're privileged by not having to live next to a massive corporate strip mine that's poisoning the local water reservoir. Somebody like you should, in fact, shut up about the topic, as you're not personally knowledgeable about environmentalism, which is proven by you not agreeing with me.<br/><br/>Wouldn't that strike you as presumptous to a degree where you would be unwilling to discuss the matter with me? I would at least think that making that string of demands about how the discourse should go would paint me as somebody who wants to sermonize, not someone who wants a discourse. That's what these equality discussions seem like, people are jumping in aggressively with their ready-made patent solutions. Of course people like Tomas are going to disrupt the proceedings, he's just too much of an ass to not shut up reverently or in fear.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>I honestly have to wonder about you as a human being.

Are you really so callous?</blockquote>\nPerhaps I should clarify that I do, indeed, have opinions about justice and about social conditions. However, I don't have any particular opinion about the American civil rights movement. This is an agnostic position, and perhaps it is callous, but it's how I've learned to wield thought over long years of exercise: to not form opinions unless there are both operative and substantial reasons for formulating the opinion. In practice this means that as long as I don't have the power or responsibility for reforming the American society, I do not need to form any particular opinions about it, either. I could see it if I had some superior solutions that I just had to share with the Americans because I'm so much better at recuperating from a history of slavery and exploitation, but I sort of suspect that nobody would like it if we started up some Finnish cultural consulate that advocated for large-scale segregation, autonomy and ultimate national independence as solutions to racial conflict (these being what made Finland what it is today).<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I do have opinions about the somewhat similar issues of social politics that are current around here. I could even say a thing or two about e.g. racism on the philosophical level. None of this constitutes a need or responsibility to automatically join a choir condemning cultural appropriation (also known as "taking influence" in other contexts). Heck, I'm pretty sure that even as I would agree with plainly laid out liberal American positions on many matters of social justice, I probably would be much too postmodern to take this whole cultural appropriation thing entirely seriously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375531/#Comment_375531" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T12:36:48+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 12:36PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>The whole point is to make these issues, and these voices, and these feelings, impossible to ignore.</blockquote>\nYou know why I posted so late to this thread, Thomas? I only posted because Jason said something similar, and I felt like telling you that that's not at all how it looks from the outside. My policy for the last two years has been specifically to <i>ignore</i> these topics at Story Games exactly because they're not fruitful. Saying that shouting is a great strategy for making people not ignore you is the exact opposite of what happens in practice, at least with people like myself. Could be that there are others who will take the dangers of racism in roleplaying more seriously after being forcefully shouted at, of course. I doubt that my opinion on the matter is going to be much affected by the Story Games crowd until and unless somebody manages to discuss it without cheap rhetorical tricks like accusations of silencing others or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375540/#Comment_375540" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T12:56:22+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 12:56PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I'm also almost certain that neither you nor Todd are actually requesting irrational adherence for or against some ideology.

(This is not an uncommon view, by the way, in America, where "playing the race card" is considered a worse political crime than actually being racist.)<br/><br/>Like, there are people in the thread who have posted that they don't think a particular Game Chef entry or text is problematic and others that say it is, and that's fine, we can debate about that, but only if we agree that we should try to do what is right, only if we think it matters.

(Understanding "racism" as attributing secondary qualities to race - I'm not quite sure what people in this thread even mean by the word.) The closest I've come during this year was when I was doing a bit of random barkeeping at the restaurant as I occasionally do, and a black man came in, and ordered an ale with a pretty thick English accent. I was surprised and had to have him repeat himself a few times before my English kicked in. Didn't think of it any further then.<br/><br/>If that seems like pretty weak-ass, that's because it is. I simply don't meet enough racially varied people in the real world to be able to get my racism on, or to witness anybody else in that regard. I've got much more dramatic experiences with sexual minority bigotry, especially as we had a publicly gay man running for president of the country a few months back; I was left with my mouth hanging neatly open when my brother-in-law told me that it's not appropriate to vote for a gay man to a prestigious office like that. A disgusting attitude in this day and age.<br/><br/>(To clarify, perhaps it would be easier to treat my experiences and reactions with sympathy and respect if I gave a short declaration of philosophical stance: as far as I'm concerned, race is not a significant factor in judging human beings with any but the crudest stochastic methods. I'm not quite sure if that qualifies me as a racist or a non-racist in American terms - I myself mostly think of racism as a quaint model of thought that should be relegated to history by civilized people.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375557/#Comment_375557" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T13:27:28+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  1:27PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2012 1:30PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>But I do refuse to "doing the right thing" as blind parroting of<span style="color: #0000FF;">social justice</span>dogma.</blockquote>\nOkay, then don't.<br/><br/>As I urged before, say what you think instead of saying other people's motives in thinking a particular way are not the proper motives for people to have when thinking.<br/><br/>You just admitted you are motivated by the same values, that you want to do the right thing.

We're having May Day protests right now as I type this.<br/><br/>I just walked back from lunch. There was a guy in front of my building, holding a sign and yelling about how the banks are criminals.<br/><br/>Everyone walked by him. The 2 ladies in front of him made some sort of comment about how it was too bad for him that he didn't have a job and was therefore spending his time complaining. The only people who were listening to him were the several police and security people near by who were on standby unless a larger crowd came and joined him. But they weren't listening carefully to him. Mostly they were chatting amongst themselves.<br/><br/>Yelling and rhetoric is very easy to ignore. I ignore it reflexively, just like I do the guys who beg me for money every single day without actually talking to me. The last one who actually spoke to me in an engaging way got a buck for his trouble. He started with "Excuse me sir, I don't mean to bother you."

This bothers me to the most in this topic, how people like e.g. Tomas are metaphorically shat upon because they "don't respect others enough". It's just too ironic for words, from where I'm sitting. The only way to accept that is an absolutist worldview where it's OK to disrespect others while demanding respect from them because they're so very much lesser people than you are yourself. Enough of an annoyment to make me join this discussion, in fact.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>I think it is incredibly important for white people to care about racism, on every scale, because (extremely sadly), it's pretty likely nothing will actually happen to fix racism until white people start stepping up to do something about it.

I'm not sure about this silencing thing, but I suspect that it's because I don't understand the concept. As far as I'm seeing is that everybody tries very hard to silence people who disagree, and there's at most polite disagreement towards non-white people. Peculiar how differently a text flow can be interpreted.<br/><br/>But in broad strokes, yes, I agree - getting rid of racist dysfunctions requires multilateral action. My own impression is that it requires first and foremost a transformation within the repressive culture, but that might just be because racism here in Finland is a sad and broken train of thought that's only taken up by the ignorant and the repulsive. So from here it seems that what racism we have (and it's been on the increase with the EU and whatnot) will ultimately be eradicated by reasoned pedagogical action and consistently condemning it in the civilized society. We have it relatively easy in this regard, I'm much more optimistic than about e.g. UK, as we're so distant from most places and the multicultural development is so even and slow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_375603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375603/#Comment_375603" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T14:51:39+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  2:51PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>Tomas, you really can't tell me that my game didn't appropriate when I'm personally telling you that, yes, to my discredit, and ultimately education, it did. </blockquote>As said; I respect your position, but disagree with your evaluation.

None of us can truly know another's motives.  And so it is best to only address their methods.<br/><br/>Ironically, this wisdom is not valued by poorly-applied social justice, which routinely claims to mind-read others and know their true, secret intent...  thought-crimes, even.<br/><br/>I would contrast that against, for example, legal systems in-which standards of evidence limit the weight given to conjecture or hearsay.<br/><br/>I would even contrast it against the social justice concept of kyriarchy, in which anyone may-- in a given context-- wield power in an abusive way, regardless of their personal history of oppression or relationship to privilege, which provide no immunity.<br/><br/>Yet now, Meserach has explicitly invited me to speculate about motives.

Will be corrected once the contest is closed.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have also suggested that the game might do just as well without any native american references. And here's where I disagree. I'll try to explain my reasoning here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic idea for the game came to me when I read about the stories of Coyote as the one who stole fire from the gods or otherwise gave it to humanity. I was fascinated by the fact that the same basic story that I knew as the myth of Prometheus since I was a little kid, was actually repeated in many cultures, including some native american cultures. That's why I felt the need to preserve that connection to that particular facet or incarnation (the Coyote-theft-of-fire stories) of this overarching narrative about how fire came to be. I am not sure I can be so bold as to call it a tribute, but I can't seem to find a better word.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was also suggested that coyotes are seen as crafty, sneaky and all that. True. In American culture. I am Polish. And somehow, my gut feeling (might be way off, but the purpose here is to explain the design decisions) was that people from other regions \u2013\xa0regions that do not have a coyote population at all, like Poland\xa0\u2013\xa0do not have the same images and ideas connected to the coyote (the animal). That's why I felt the animal by itself wouldn't be enough. In fact, I was afraid that for some potential players the initial coyote reference would be Wile E. Coyote \u2013 which is not what I wanted. The native american elements were supposed to serve as a pointer to a different point of reference.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I concede that both of these goals could have probably been achieved using subtler and more culturally sensitive methods. I plan to iterate on the text until it feels right \u2013 and would welcome the help of people on this forum (though reading this thread alone was already helpful).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also offer you this observation \u2013\xa0cultural sensitivity seems to differ from culture to culture. None of my Polish friends even mentioned the native american theme in their reviews or comments of Lies of Passage. Possibly because we have no contact with Native Americans or their culture. Now, if I were to write a game about, say, Jews \u2013\xa0a group with a history intimately intertwined with that of my people \u2013 the reactions would surely be stronger. And it's not an intellectual problem, I think, more of an empathic and emotional response that is stronger or weaker depending on the context and the "closeness" of a particular culture to ours.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I also believe the basic point made in this thread, "look, this can be offensive to people", is something that "cannot be unseen" \u2013\xa0i.e. once my reviewers drew my attention to that fact, I cannot "stop" seeing it in parts of the text. Which would mean this sensitivity can (and probably should) be trained.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the risk of sounding a bit pompous, I view the myth of Prometheus and the story of Coyote and fire (as well as the flood myths appearing in many cultures and other tropes and themes that are repeated) as proof that there is or was a global culture, and it echoes in many of the cultures of the world. I strongly feel this "unity" should be embraced and explored. That's what I tried to do, to the best of my ability (within a week). Now all that's left is iterate and/or try anew.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I learned something here, and I hope I'm not the only one.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Also \u2013\xa0wow, I never thought that my first post on this forum would be on the subject of racism and appropriation, huh\u2026)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376151/#Comment_376151" name="Item_187" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T08:44:15+00:00" title="May  3, 2012  8:44AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Willow</cite>So, who's fault is it?<br><br>Is it Jonathan Walton's fault that 'Coyote' was used as a word?

A monoculture is the result of sameness, and social justice is anything but uniform or in agreement. I don't really get the biology anaolgy you're going for, though. The objective of social justice is to break the monoculture of privileged classes, not replace it with another one.<br/><br/>It's not a system to try and impose anything, but I'm new to it, so I could be wrong about how it's intended to be used. I can only speak to how I use it, and the value that I see in it. If it's intended to be a dogmatic monoculture, then I'm moving it away from that for myself, if no one else, as far and as fast as I can manage.<br/><br/>It's not a dogma. It's a system to develop tools to talk about these things. We're supposed to be somewhat scientific about this. Grow and change based on observed results. These are tricky topics, proof given by this sinking thread and heated arguments and accusations of dogma and racism and cultish behavior.  Do the links I posted have problems? Probably. <br/><br/>But again, I'm new to it, so if there are problems and dogmatic behavior from it, I haven't encountered any of that. There could be several reasons. My ignorance. The problems are small compared to the problems I see it working against. The problems are from how others use it, which is not how I use it. Blindness and privilege which hasn't been worked out yet. All of those are solvable problems.<br/><br/>The point of social justice is to find a way to dialog that moves forward. We are hopefully constantly moving forward. And that means we're constantly leaving behind works, which in the internet age can mean posts and comments and tweets, that are pretty awful. Sometimes this realization can come because a person was angry and then an hour later calmed down. Sometimes it comes from a growth in understanding.  The trap is to stick to your guns. Defend that last post. Defend that email. Defend those words of the past.<br/><br/>I'm doing the best I can in every moment of my life. But I'm far from perfect. I just hope that what I'm doing next is better than what I just did.<br/><br/>However, if you dismiss things because they have good and bad points, then I am unclear on what about human behavior you don't disregard. I would rather keep the good points and fix the bad ones, instead of throwing the whole thing out.  The former is how we grow and change. The latter is the clarion call of revolutionaries and extremists who don't seem to make much headway.<br/><br/>Dogma doesn't change. Social justice tools are constantly changing and growing and responding to feedback. I know this because this is how I'm treating the tools I've been handed. If those links are dogmatic, then they were still helpful building blocks, much like the dogma of many of the world's religions helped birth compassion and connectivity in many societies even as those dogmas were used to control and oppress.  We don't live in a black and white world. We don't even have pure good or pure bad within ourselves. We contain multitudes.<br/><br/>We're better off with a multitude of approaches, not tossing away ideas because our personal experience was distasteful, or we dislike the people involved.<br/><br/>Or maybe you just have a bone to pick, since you enjoy using emotionally charged words and playing with color codes. Whatever your experience has been, who ever caused you hurt, whoever silenced you, that's not my intention. I'm sorry if you felt otherwise. But throwing around terms like "dogma" and "rhetoric" doesn't really help me understand what actually you have a problem with. Though it's fair that you felt this wasn't the place to go into detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376289/#Comment_376289" name="Item_191" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T19:48:00+00:00" title="May  3, 2012  7:48PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I'm not arguing that indigenous people are closer to nature, Jogesh. I'm arguing a principle here. If the fact of the matter is that a real estate broker is closer to nature than, say; a ballerina (and that the fact may be convincingly argued), then stating it is no prejudice. Of course; you may find a nice example of a ballerina perfectly in tune with nature, showing that your<i>general</i>truth not always applies on an<i>individual</i>level.</blockquote>\nWhat I'm hearing is that you're arguing a hypothetical situation and saying what if this principle is true? I'm saying it's an unhelpful principle because the principle is unsound.  There is no fact of the matter that a real estate broker is closer to nature. Just because you can convincingly argue it does not make something true. It just means you can convince people. Again, what does closer mean? What does nature mean? If we are in agreement, you can probably convince me. If we are in disagreement, you probably cannot. If we are in agreement, then we find a real estate broker not close to nature, what then? She's not a "real" real estate broker? "Exception that proves the rule"? Modify the initial proof? What if it turns out that real estate brokers are close to nature because that's part of the training. If everyone had that training, we'd all be close to nature. Or, later other real estate schools pop up and remove that part of the training. Or we might find that learning to be closer to nature sets you up to love real estate.<br/><br/>The principle is unsound because it always breaks down at the individual level. Because the things we can't change, biology, psychology, chemical and material composition, are nearly identical. There's a set of human behavior and function that is universally the same, regardless of race, culture, or other conditions. From what we can tell, there's a lot of similarity to other highly intelligent animals too.  The things that make us different are cultural and effects of our environment.<br/><br/>Across human history we have thought we knew generalities and stereotypes to be true. 100 years ago in America and Europe it was "true" that blacks were stupid and lazy. 400 years ago in Plymouth colony it was "true" that the Native Americans were savage and violent and could not be reasoned with. 2000 years ago it was "true" for the Romans that the people of the north were barbarians incapable of advanced society or language.  And yet, no matter how convinced were are, no matter how many centuries we labor under beliefs that we're fundamentally different from each other, no matter how successful the society is that harbors those beliefs, no matter where we draw the line and say, "No, this line is correct this time," we end up wrong.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter what generalities we can convince each other on. We'll end up wrong if we're pretending that one human (or group) is fundamentally different from us.  Truth is in the eye of the beholder.<br/><br/>If we want to explore your principle, let's make up some new illusions, like elves who worship the trees or dwarves who are greedy miners so that we can explore the effects of ignorance and prejudice and racism or whatever else.  I don't see the point in exploring real illusions that are the source or real pain and oppression for many people for the sake of fun and self enjoyment. If we know those stereotypes are false, let's set them aside as artifacts of an ignorant past, something to learn from so we don't repeat those mistakes, and explore how ignorance is created and maintained without alienating the people who have or still suffer from divisive treatment. If we still believe generalities are true, then lets explore and challenge those, perhaps by pretending they aren't true, and find out what we learn about current ignorance that we're ignorant of.\n<blockquote>- you claim that I ask someone to educate me. I do not. I ask people who claim racism is going on, to give us examples, and arguments based on actual examples. That is not me asking for "education"; it is a wish to discuss real issues.</blockquote>\nVery real, and broad and sensitive issue. My point was only that you can educate yourself. What you were doing, to my reading, was challenging the idea and dismissing the claims of racism as not actually being racist. That is the core problem. Not that you asked for examples, but that you asked for, got them, and then dismissed them as not good enough.  That is what is unacceptable.<br/><br/>Bring forth that empathy and listen when people say that something is racist or diminishing and focus on putting yourself into that place and accept what they say. At some point you will have to admit that your privilege will prevent you from truly seeing all the details no matter how many examples you get. Take what you get and empathize.\n<blockquote>It is indeed perfectly understandable to find ourselves in over our heads. Please understand that lashing out like you do, Jogesh, as if I am a bad person some way (by consent between you and pidgeon, obviously), I see it as YOU plunging in too deep; you try to make it personal. That is not good. You loose sight of the issue here, Jogesh.</blockquote>\nI'm sorry that I lashed out. Pigeon and I certainly were not in consent. You are not a bad person. You were just doing things that could be seen as bad, and given the turn this thread had taken by that point - were being reacted to as bad things. Above all else, I saw them as bad things and still do.  That I reacted badly does not make that less true.<br/><br/>I'm sorry you've have bad experiences, but that is completely beside the point. Trauma is traumatic to all who experience it. The most privileged children can get scarred by having a life free of hardship. I'm not rejecting your experience, just saying that it doesn't matter how good or bad you've had it, it doesn't give you the right to deny the experiences of others, particularly when it comes to experiences of oppression like racism.<br/><br/>It's important to separate your art from discussion. In art, you can go for the easy picture to complex issues to provoke reactions and discussions with people. But when we're talking about these issues, I'm sorry but we need to go for the complex solution of digging deep to the heart of matters, unearthing the unnoticed causes, and challenging our own perceptions of things to take in the perception of others. It's not an easy solution, but as you say, easy solutions never work out. It IS a simple solution, because really it only involves truly listening and empathizing and challenging your self constantly. Simple to say, pretty much impossible to do consistently, especially when some jerk like me comes out of nowhere and jumps down your throat about it.<br/><br/>I see a lot of the artist in your coming out in these discussions. You want to be challenging and confrontational. You want to shock people and break them out of their conceptions. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's how it seems to me.  What I was trying to tell you is that can make great art, but for understanding and discussion it is divisive and alienating and shuts people down or causes them to get emotional. Like I did. In many threads I really admire that in you, but it just does not come across well on these more sensitive topics.<br/><br/>I'm sorry I got emotional and lashed out at you and made it sound like I was personally attacking you.

They influence us. They are especially interesting when it comes to social strata, and our chances in life.<br/><br/>I now a bit about indians, but a lot more about the sami people of Norway. So here's a painful sami-"stereotype":<br/><br/>- single sami men in Oslo drink a lot. They have a dependency of alcohol that's way over that of other men. it may be described as an "epidemic of alcoholism" amongst them. So; to say single sami men in Oslo are drunkards is true. They live in a "culture" where drinking and quarreling, and being bitter about their destiny, is a predominant feature. They could also be said to be further from nature than other men, as they have learned to feel shame over their own heritage. They abhor the "primitive man of nature" that was ridiculed in their youth. So they live in the city of Oslo, as far removed from their origins as possible.<br/><br/>In their youth these men were sent to boarding schools, where they lived an learned, under the strict observance of Norwegian teachers and boarding-house masters. The grown-ups all took part in the "assimilation" of sami youth into Norwegian culture. These dirty and dumb savages had to be made part of civilization. Part of that assimilation was to portray sami as primitive, dirty, heathen, and good-for-nothing. The description closely matched the prejudice towards sami at the time, a prejudice that imbued the whole system. <br/><br/>So; the sami children was sent away by their parents, to a place where all dignity and identity were beaten out of them. To survive they had to find their place in this cruel system; at the bottom, being "civilized". They so desperately wanted to belong back then, that they tried in any way to rid themselves of the label "sami". And so they tried to become like their oppressors, lashing out against all things sami to prove themselves. They inherited the prejudice from their oppressors; a strong prejudice against themselves, their own kind, and their "primitive" culture. <br/><br/>It did not work out, of course. It only succeeded in turning each one of them into a sad caricature of a man; the good-for-nothing that the prejudice had described. They were too fucked up by the system of oppression, to become anything but that. It steered them towards a destiny of self-loathing and depression, making alcohol an easy way to dull the internal pain. <br/><br/>These men have no tools to change their destiny; their life is spent. They are the scar tissue of cruel and cynical politics; the politics of sami-assimilation into Norwegian culture. I know these men. I've lived amongst them for many years, when I myself was a single man, and "scar tissue" (for other reasons).<br/><br/>That's a way to create a true <i>stereotype</i>, and to make the man himself carry it around the rest of his life, as a bloody, heavy cross.<br/>A similar pattern can be found in inuit children being sent from Greenland to Denmark in the same period (the 50s through the 70s).<br/>I fear similar patterns is well known by all indigenous people around the world, being subject to such "assimilations".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jogesh EZ</cite>I'm sorry I got emotional and lashed out at you and made it sound like I was personally attacking you. Hopefully this post reiterated what I tried to say, and failed miserably at, and was clearer in explaining where I am coming from.</blockquote>It is forgotten. I do not carry grudges, and as said; I do see that it is hard not to feel strongly about these things. <br/><br/>If you are at the receiving end, feeling strongly about it and shouting your pain is a lot better than shame and silence. So I do like discussions like these; not only do they open the field for discussion and understanding; they also open the tear-ducts of some victims (or children of victims). And that's the first step in a healing-process.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jogesh EZ</cite>it doesn't matter how good or bad you've had it, it doesn't give you the right to deny the experiences of others, particularly when it comes to experiences of oppression like racism.</blockquote>If I were in denial about what indigenous people have experienced, I would rather say; "O'boy, now those indians are at it again! Can't they just let it be!?"<br/>- and I would proceed to ignore the whole discussion.<br/><br/>I don't ignore or deny it, Jogesh, for the simple reason that I care about these things. You have to see that <i>discussing</i> the issue is far from <i>denying</i> it. Discussing an issue, and arguing different positions in relation to it, is us applying reason to the elements we perceive to be part of it, to investigate what is true, and what is myth. <br/><br/>After a good discussion we will be able to discern a bit more between truth and myth than before. Let us hope that is true after this one too.<br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376379/#Comment_376379" name="Item_193" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T08:33:48+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  8:33AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Tomas, nobody's going to call you racist for pointing out substance abuse problems or identifying the social issues they stem from, but "drunkard" and "eskimo" are pejoratives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376391/#Comment_376391" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T09:34:17+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  9:34AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2012 9:41AM by Todd_L.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Calling those terms pejoratives as if that's absolutely true ignores melioration and <a href="http:// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change" rel="nofollow">semantic change.</a><br/> <br/>That's the sort of thing I meant in calling sj a monoculture: it doesn't see itself as A method of progess, but rather The sole way.

I'm not suffering for the sami people, nor for the indians. I empathize with them, but don't cry their tears. There's a significant difference.<br/><br/>As for why I do it; I'm part sami myself, without having had to experience the sami suffering. I'm interested in the sami culture and history due to part of my family being sami. It may also have something to do with sami tragedies mirroring my own life in some respects. It makes it easier for me to identify with some of the issues, and to see the psychosocial effects, and it makes my investigation all the more imperative for me personally.<br/><br/>And still; I do not suffer their traumas, and don't cry their tears.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376499/#Comment_376499" name="Item_196" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T17:52:19+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  5:52PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2012 5:52PM by Johnstone.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Todd, the point wasn't about language police, it was about empathy.

It's a bit hard to take someone seriously when they say they want to empathize with people and then refer to them by a name those people find offensive. While the indigenous people of Alaska don't seem to have a problem with the name "eskimo," people of that culture in Canada and Greenland have asked specifically, as a community, to be called Inuit instead.<br/><br/>And yeah, I realize people get called racist for appropriation and "being white and around," but what the fuck?

This isn't universal or always very strongly associated with the word, and you may not pick up on those associations using English in Norway, but just because it's not a racist pejorative doesn't mean it's a value-neutral word all over the place. It's not. If you're going to be communicating with English-speaking people who do have those associations, and especially if you're presenting yourself as someone who empathizes with the people you are labeling "drunkards," you should know what it means. It's counter-productive to the message you're trying to communicate in the same way using the word eskimo is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_376548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376548/#Comment_376548" name="Item_199" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T00:35:40+00:00" title="May  5, 2012 12:35AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Todd; I saw your point, but at the same time I saw you saying "Tomas' appropriation of native suffering", and that implies my writing being such an "appropriation". If you insist on using the term, as a term for bad behavior, you should take care exactly how you use it; <br/>- to make the description of humans and their suffering into "appropriation", cross the line of gagging a discussion. You leave no field of understanding, no common ground for meaningful dialogue to take place in. There is no way forward from such an impasse.<br/><br/>Johnstone; I know very well that "drunkard" has negative connotations. We have a similar word in Norwegian; "fyllik", a word proper people wrinkle their nose over. Being in the clutches of the Liquor-demon is seriously negative, so I consider the negative connotations of the word to be good.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my conclusions for this thread, as I see it.<br/><br/>I understand why "appropriation" is so central in your relationship to indian culture; it has been the victim of much of that kind, having been forced to see others "interpreting" their culture en'masse. In films for sure, and maybe in games too. So I do see how this is important for you, and why you react when something is claimed to be cultural appropriation. <br/><br/>But ...<br/><br/>APPROPRIATION<br/>The claims that certain games/text in the Game Chef competition is "appropriating" indian culture in a bad way, has not been convincingly put. It is not enough to cite a text, and say it is "appropriating". Self-evident discourse is not sufficient. I expect people to say more; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how</span> they appropriate, and what consequences said appropriation may have. None of the texts cited appropriate indian culture in any bad way. I will say that they use elements from indian culture in a creative and constructive way, to inspire good design. There is nothing bad in it.<br/><br/>RACISM<br/>The claims that any of the Game Chef texts are "racist", is totally unfounded. I have seen no evidence to that effect, and have heard no arguments close to being convincing. None of the texts cited has any racism to them.<br/><br/>THE PREMISE FOR ROLE-PLAYING GAMES<br/>As I see it, the term "appropriating" is troublesome. At least in the way it is used here. It is used in a way that is anathema to role-playing games. <br/><br/>Role-playing games is all about "walking in the shoes of another being", and that is only possible if we accept the fact that some understanding is required to do this, and indeed; may be gleaned from doing it; that when you play another being you actually unlock a deeper understanding of how that being act, talk, think and feel. The whole idea of role-playing games hinges on this premise.<br/><br/>Those of us a bit experienced in playing serious roles in rpgs, know this premise to be true; we do unlock a deeper understanding of other beings by playing them.<br/><br/>REDUCING HUMANS TO BIGOTS<br/>The term "appropriating" has been used to hammer home that only indians can talk about indians here, or in game texts. All others doing that must be "bad" in some way, according to the ones propagating this view. This is a view of the world (and indians) that totally disregard the human capacity of understanding other humans, showing empathy and feeling sympathy. It disregard our capacity to understand how our actions may affect other human beings, and our capacity to predict and understand the actions of others.<br/><br/>I do not believe in such a reductionist view of humans. We are far better. Most humans are not bigots, but socially intelligent beings with strong ethics to guide them. We are fallible, but also conscientious and forgiving, and able to create joyful interaction with our fellow beings. That is at the core of being human.<br/><br/>_____________________________________<br/><br/>That is my conclusions. I hope you see the reasoning behind them. I have found the discussion to be very interesting, and have enjoyed our shared ability to keep it (largely) on track. Thank you all for the discussion!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376635/#Comment_376635" name="Item_202" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T19:29:14+00:00" title="May  5, 2012  7:29PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is all well and good if you like, but you're essentially ignoring the arguments being made against yours and making up a different one which is so patently ridiculous that it is easy to refute. This is what's known in philosophical/rhetorical circles as "the strawman" argument. See, the idea that only indians can talk about indians is so fucking stupid that if anyone actually had said it, I would immediately have agreed with you that that was not true. <br/><br/>So now that we're past that, what myself and several others have suggested is that indians are in the best position to be talking about indians, you know, being a firsthand source of information on what it's like to be an indian and all. Failing that, the best option, if you plan to write something which you'll be posting anywhere publically at least, is to get to know your subject material REALLY well, through secondhand information (eg, interview an indian about her culture) or failing that, to research peer-reviewed studies on indians and read some reputable texts regarding indian history and culture, before you go around making broad statements about them.<br/><br/>To do otherwise is akin to saying, "Christians are homophobes, amirite?" versus doing the research and saying that, according to Leviticus 18:22, "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it <i>is</i> abomination," which fundamentalist christians take to heart and internalize as a reason to avoid homosexuals. However, there is also a large contingent of christians who disagree with this passage as outdated, given that this area of the bible also says that eating shellfish is an abomination (Lev 11:10) and that you should own slaves, but you ought to buy them from a neighboring nation (buy local, guys!). (Lev 25:44).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376705/#Comment_376705" name="Item_203" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T07:07:05+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  7:07AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2012 8:51AM by Wordman.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>So now that we're past that, what myself and several others have suggested is that indians are in the best position to be talking about indians, you know, being a firsthand source of information on what it's like to be an indian and all.

Very logical, and everyone has a clear course to acceptable behavior.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I don't think that argument is true. Instead, I think it looks like this:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://rpg.divnull.com/graphics/cult2.png"/><br/><br/>In other words, for some significant segment of people who would level charges of "cultural appropriation" against someone from culture X designing a game about culture Y, there is <i>no amount of research</i> that will insulate the designer from charges of cultural appropriation, racism, etc.<br/><br/>Now, you might say, well, even accepting that as true, isn't it still better to do the research and know the culture when building a game about it? And, of course, the answer is "sure". A better researched product is always more sensitive (and probably better in most other ways) than one that is not.<br/><br/>But look at it this way. Lets say I'm a designer from culture X wanting to build a game about culture Y. If I created the product with no research at all, say there are 100 people that would get offended enough to publicly accuse me of cultural appropriation and/or racism (and the assumption there are some proportional number who are offended but don't say anything). Instead, I do a lot of research, enough such that 80 of those 100 people no longer get offended enough to publicly accuse me of cultural appropriation and/or racism. The firestorm created by the remaining 20 offended people, however, is almost indistinguishable from the one that would have been created if all 100 were offended, even if some or all of the 80 no-longer-offended come to my defense.<br/><br/>As a designer who respects culture Y, the goal would be to offend no one. This, of course, is unrealistic and not possible; you will always offend <i>someone</i>. So, a really strong and mature designer might say, "well, I built the game as well as I could, and did all the research I can. Hopefully, I treated the subject well enough to avoid offending most people in culture Y, and maybe give others an appreciation of culture Y. I'll just have to take the whips of those who think I failed. Maybe that's the best that can be hoped for." However, I don't think anyone should find it strange or unreasonable if my conclusion before even writing the game "this is going to end in tears no matter how well I do it. Better to just leave writing about culture Y to culture Y and spend my energy elsewhere". And, hey, maybe that's exactly what those 20 offended people wanted in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376716/#Comment_376716" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T09:41:49+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  9:41AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure that there was any useful argument in that entire post.

I certainly agree that no one can necessarily avoid offending everyone all the time, but the fact that you show respect in your writing for the people involved, by caring enough to ensure accuracy in your writing and sensitivity in your portrayals.<br/><br/>Incidentally, that's the only issue I have had in any of these threads: lack of respect. If we could just pretend that we're actually speaking to other human beings in a room full of people, it might go a long way towards an atmosphere in which people feel comfortable sharing and offering opinions and experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376717/#Comment_376717" name="Item_205" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T09:44:53+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  9:44AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2012 9:45AM by JDCorley.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite>As a designer who respects culture Y, the goal would be to offend no one.

I'm trying to see why this is an avoidable thing. Everyone imagines that the work they <i>would have</i> done, but didn't (for any reason), would have been perfect in every way. I know all the games I didn't write are phenomenal!<br/><br/>No, I don't find it strange that someone might decide to pick a subject matter that won't stir people up. But I also don't find it strange that someone might pick a subject matter that will. And I'm fine with a firestorm being stirred up, if that's how people feel about what someone did, go for it and hash it out, it's the only way to move forward.  Scream at each other, and argue strenuously, it's fun! <br/><br/>Anyway, your tradeoff example isn't what happened here, is it?  We're talking about Game Chef, a contest where you absolutely must not, MUST NOT spend a ton of time researching or thinking about what you're making, just do it and get it out the door. All games on all subjects in Game Chef are ill thought out and sloppy. That is why it's Game Chef.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376959/#Comment_376959" name="Item_206" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T11:54:53+00:00" title="May  7, 2012 11:54AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2012 12:11PM by Wordman.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>I'm not sure that there was any useful argument in that entire post.</blockquote>\nI didn't tie a bow around that, did I? The point was this:<br/><br/>The prior post to mine said basically this:<br/><br/>"No one is making Argument X. Argument X is stupid. Instead we are saying that the <i>result</i> of Argument X is actually best, but following Process Y is also acceptable." This construct only makes sense if Process Y is satisfiable. If it is not, then the net effect of what you are actually doing is <i>making Argument X</i>, even though you are not <i>articulating</i> it directly. (Extreme example: if you say "No one is saying that elves aren't allowed in our building. That would be stupid. Instead we are saying that it's best if no elves enter our building, but any who can leap over the thousand foot chasm to reach the building are allowed in." \u2026then you might as well be saying "elves aren't allowed in our building".)<br/> <br/>In this case, Process Y == (do a really, really large amount research until everyone is no longer offended). My post with the graphs intends to show <i>that is not actually possible</i>. So, the only part of your position that remains is "indians are in the best position to be talking about indians". While this is not exactly the same thing as saying "only indians can talk about indians", it isn't entirely unrelated either.<br/><br/>So, the point was this: consider that the "fucking stupid" argument you keep calling a strawman isn't <i>entirely</i> the strawman you think it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376996/#Comment_376996" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T14:04:04+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  2:04PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2012 2:06PM by UserClone.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the argument is that even if you research so much that you become more knowledgable about (and potentially more empathetic/sympathetic to) the culture in question than a given offended person whose background genetically or familially lies within that culture, and they insist on being offended simply because you are not of that culture, regardless of how well-informed, accurate, realistic, and informative your depictions are, that you still are going to have accusations of cultural appropriation?<br/><br/>Yes, yes you will. But are they at all valid at that point? Also, you just birthed a new strawman, where you claim that I said it was possible for everyone to no longer be offended. Someone will be offended no matter what you do, be it in any realm of media. I actually already put forth that statement. I was talking about a best case scenario. That's still going to include corner cases of folks who insist on being offended simply because you're white, say, and not a native american (even if they themselves are not native american, frex).<br/><br/>So I'm going to stand by my previous assertion: fucking stupid strawman is fucking stupid.<br/><br/>More or less:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/demotivational-posters-your-argument1.jpg"/><br/><br/>EDIT: I think I may have injected too much snark in there, as I just woke up from a nap that was maybe too short, and I haven't been sleeping well, so I'm prone to being pretty fucking cranky.
