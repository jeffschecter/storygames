And, wow, it unbelievably rocked beyond anything I had expected, and if you need further proof, you can see me gushing in just about every post GenCon thread here.<br/><br/>While at the con, I was thinking "Next time is Origins, and maybe GenCon every two or three years."  But I'm STILL coming down from the gaming high.  I know Origins is more RPG centric, but I have a hard time of it living up to the GenCon dealer room, various story game/indie RPG demos, and last and certainly not least, the quality games and people to be found in Games on Demand and Embassy Suites (Sweets?)<br/><br/>So what's generally a better gaming experience, GenCon or Origins?  Where is my vacation time and money better spent?  Specifically from a story gaming perspective.<br/><br/>I have no doubts I'll get to Origins at some point just to experience it, so I'm looking for "You should go because its awesome" not "You should go because you haven't been."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89538/#Comment_89538" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T12:59:25+00:00" title="August 22, 2007 12:59PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Origins is a much more intimate, relaxed experience.

There is, for example, no equivalent of the Embassy Suites at Origins.<br/><br/>That said, Origins does rule, and I'd love to see more of all of you there.<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89541/#Comment_89541" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T13:02:15+00:00" title="August 22, 2007  1:02PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, there's playing in the breezeway after hours at Origins.

I've been in some of the best RPG sessions of my life at Gen Con. Origins didn't have the energy of the other show. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I'm doing both. Gen Con as a dealer and Origins as a game presenter (and this year as a War College lecturer). I can do this because my brother Ian lives in Columbus so I have a place to crash. <br/>\n<br/>\nConventions are expensive and I can only justify a few of them as advertising for Matrix Games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with the assessment that Origins in a board game show. That's how it started out and they still give a lot of floor space to board games. Role playing is stuck over in the Hyatt. The boardgame and miniatures halls were next to the dealers area (and openned up to it at the back of teh hall.)<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89550/#Comment_89550" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T13:14:34+00:00" title="August 22, 2007  1:14PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>Role playing is stuck over in the Hyatt.</blockquote>\nThis is not correct.

Note that the only other option here would be to put RPGs in one of the halls somehow. But that would be a bad thing. Just because they have the big halls dedicated to boardgames and minis doesn't mean that it's really so heavily boardgamey. Recall that Origins predates RPGs (as does GenCon, interestingly). As such RPGs are always said to be an "invader" to Origins. But that sentiment died in actuality about fifteen years ago, and people just still talk about it. Now what remains is just the classic tendency for gamers to cordon themselves off into smaller groups, lamenting that their group is shrinking due to losses to the other groups (when, in fact, this isn't true, and losses are due to other factors entirely). <br/>\n<br/>\nThey're "game conventions." Not RPG conventions, or boardgame conventions. Maybe they're even "hobby game conventions" as Origins stipulates. I dunno. All I can say is that there are more RPGs played at Origins than any other convention that I can think of except for GenCon. So saying that it's not a RPG convention... I'm not sure what point there is to that. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.
