We mostly went and play the totally paranoid good guys the whole game, helping each other. We escape in a helicopter and land on a carrier, where we get surrounded by soldiers, still not knowing which side are they on. We finally take a chance and surrender.<br/><br/>In the epilogue, we found out each one of us was the leader of a different huge evil faction... and started to laugh like megalomaniacs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370986/#Comment_370986" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T15:07:46+00:00" title="April  3, 2012  3:07PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, sounds a lot like a session of Psi*Run... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372220/#Comment_372220" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T16:29:49+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  4:29PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2012 4:32PM by Krippler.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The best roleplaying session of my life was this weekend at Gothcon.<br/><br/>My character stood by her every ideal and lost the love of her life. It was probably unavoidable. Another character lost everything about herself (faith, ethics, community) except the madness induced by her time in the xenomold zone and the love of another character. She ended up in a closed psyche ward occationally visited by her love. This was a <i>happy</i> ending us four other players had struggled to see happen.

They are so open to everything! Started to play with children that age back in -95, when I was a bit tired of running games, and their total immersion and enthusiasm reawakened my rpg-spirit.<br/><br/>Another goodie, way back (-89), in my game <b>Muu</b>:<br/>- a group of friends playing the first campaign ever in the game. One muu going through pains and planning during several sessions, to find out how to build something, and slowly it is all coming together ...<br/>- but then here is this throw of the die, to see if muu succeed in a crucial task, and he fails. It was all about muu putting his finger down into the ground! Alas; at that particular spot the ground was too hard and dry for this to happen, so it was painful to ram the finger into the hard earth ...<br/>- and that made muu, without a second thought, turn his attention towards cuddling (to alleviate the pain), and then he was hungry, and he trundled on, never looking back on the lost ambition of engineering ...<br/><br/>It was a great game-session, and then my friends, all fired up on the potential of the plan the muu had laid, sat in the sofa and discussed what may have happened, and that discussion is one of the silliest and most enthusiastic post-game discussions I've ever witnessed. Amongst other things they dicussed what would happen if muu succeeded in placing a rock on top of another rock, and a third rock besides the first one, and then a rock on top of that one, etc-etc. I listened to them, and laughed, and they continued, and I laughed, and so on and so on into the night. And we all felt we had a good groove with the universe, while in harmony with each other, and at peace. A nice game of Muu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381808/#Comment_381808" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T23:11:55+00:00" title="June 10, 2012 11:11PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2012 11:12PM by Arpie.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First time I ever completed a full series in Prime Time Adventures.

I'm a gullible farm kid who thinks he's a Zen monk, but he's really just a fighter. Still, he won't wear armor, and all he'll carry is a quarterstaff. Also, he never strikes first. He hooks up with a Paladin of Brigit, a young flame worshipping hot-head. That guy burns everything. There's another guy I forget (MU with 1 HP, maybe?). The paladin and I argue theology at every turn. But we're broke. So we follow a treasure map to this cave complex &amp; go tromping down inside. We get jumped by some giant cave ostrich, and in a lucky hit, the paladin goes down. So does the other guy. The torch hits the ground. I'm fighting blind. I'm down to one hit point as a giant cave chicken tries to kill me. The GM and I each roll miss after miss. There is panting and flailing in the dark. And after countless rounds, needing something crazy like a 18 or 19, I hit. The chicken goes down. I drag my companions to safety, feeling the way, watching the wandering monster die with a fixed stare. Ultimately, we all live. Later, we torture a goblin as a test of preordination vs free-will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381865/#Comment_381865" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T09:29:34+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  9:29AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            High school, playing a mostly-homebrew, mostly free-form version of AD&amp;D 2E with two friends who have never played before.

I say yes, his STR roll is high enough, and we all sit there grinning about how fucking awesome this game is.
