Started flipping through it recently and while I Iiked some parts (subsystem for groin shots), I'm put off by other parts (obtuse skill system). <br/><br/>So has anyone here played this,and is it worth it to learn? I've learned games as technical as Torchbearer, but nothing as complicated as Burning Wheel.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428305/#Comment_428305" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-15T12:01:20+00:00" title="February 15, 2014 12:01PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so, this is a bit off topic but from what I've seen of Aces and Eights? It's WAY more complicated than The Burning Wheel. The Burning Wheel has subsystems that are only used in very specific circumstances, and you can ignore them until your comfortable with the basic game mechanics. If you can handle Torchbearer, you can handle Burning Wheel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell" title="Russell"><img alt="Russell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell">Russell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428650/#Comment_428650" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-22T23:56:56+00:00" title="February 22, 2014 11:56PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run it. It's very old-school in terms of mood and style, but it has some very cool ideas. The basics are pretty straightforward and you can run a game using a small subset of the rules. It has a nice idea in the career paths - inasmuch as you can choose a career at any session and gain points for following that career. The sub games are great fun, and weirdly my only criticism of the game is that there aren't enough of them (I'd love a running-a-hotel subgame).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
