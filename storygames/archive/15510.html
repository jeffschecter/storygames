I'm sure many of you have already enjoyed what is the hilariously chaotic and yet dangerously fun game that is group play of ACTION CASTLE! Well I have put a Play-by-Post game of it up for any randomer to enter commands over at Giant in the Playground, for your viewing/gaming pleasure. Of course, I slightly modified the rules to fit the medium, which was discussed in the opening post, but per one of the player's suggestion, I also am posting cheeky responses to incorrect actions regardless of whether they make it through consensus. This has naturally resulted in more fun for all. Without further ado, <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?t=224827" rel="nofollow">enjoy (and by all means join in the fun)</a>!<br/><br/>P.S. If people seem to be enjoying themselves enough by the end, I plan to bust out ALL of the Parsely games in this fashion, either in order, or by polling players for their preference of next game.<br/><br/>P.P.S. If Jared is watching, and would prefer I not post the actual gameplay in a public forum (I am sensitive to the needs of the indie designer and I could see where that might inhibit OR increase sales), I can just stop after finishing with ACTION CASTLE, or even cut it off mid-game if necessary. Just let me know.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.
