I had some practical questions about practice at the table:<br/>\n1) What issues or delights would be created by having a rotating cast of characters doing the delves?  Would it be an issue for the Microscope session?  Obviously, everyone would need to be present for that... or would they?  Could you have two groups going at once exploring different areas and then share the info between them as they cross pollinated?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Seeing as how Microscope allows you to affect any time period, were there any concerns about how players might affect the current time?  Or were the start and end periods defined as outside of the game time?  Would it be a bad thing if there was some modification of the present or reference to the players?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Are the events at the game table codified and transferred into the history, to make sure that things line up with the Microscope game?  If so, how?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for posting this idea...

That would totally work. I think you could have different rosters of players in the dungeon crawl, though generally it's harder to add people part way through Microscope games. You could even have different dungeon crawl parties and then mix them (or just their duly elected representatives) to play Microscope together. Everyone wouldn't have to be in the Microscope sessions, but they would be having a different experience. Players who were in the Microscope sessions would obviously have a much richer sense of the dungeon's background.<br/><br/>I was envisioning the entire Microscope history ending before the current adventuring era. Keep it all in the past. Plus the scope of the history is the dungeon itself, not the wider world (unless you want to do that). If I'm reading you correctly, 3 would be moot because the Microscope history would all be in the past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359634/#Comment_359634" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T14:53:32+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  2:53PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2012 2:54PM by jackson_tegu.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I was imagining that each Dungeon crawl session would be akin to a "scene" (the closest that we zoom in, in Microscope), and could even be based around one central question, for example: "Do the heroes cause the Demon Blaythyx to disgorge the Gem of Altruunis?" <br/>At the end of the session, we know the answer.<br/><br/>And then we play a microscope session, and it could affect what we'd been calling the "present day".<br/><br/>And after that microscope sesh, the DM would take a hard look at what had been made, and if what had been made was maybe gonna make the dungeon crawl crappy, then the DM could say, "Ok, those old characters aren't who we're focusing on anymore. Make new characters, in this era here.

If you think of the two games as sitting on the scales, the Dungeon Ouroboros is D&amp;D-heavy, whereas yours is much more Microscope.<br/><br/>In fact that just made me think of another crazy inversion: playing a normal "in the moment" game about people's lives (say, PTA) then diving in and creating the history of their lives within those scenes. You're talking about that time in college in the "normal" scene, you play the harp music and fade, then go make some Microscope history to find out what college was like\u2026 then fade right back into the scene.

So you're playing PTA or something. When it's your turn to be the Microscope Lens, it means that you get to decide when during a normal role-playing scene to cue the harp music and start exploring the past -- it could be now, it could be later. You pick the Focus right then ("the day his uncle went over the trenches\u2026") and then just play the Microscope rotation normally. When you get back to the Lens and wrap up the Focus, jump back into the present action.
