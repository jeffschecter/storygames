I'm using the term "domain" to mean any broad section of the rules; it could be a rules subsystem (authority over combat, situation design, character creation,) a topic (weapon damage, size, and weight,) a geographical area, or a game component (NPCs, PCs.)</p>\n<p>Authority may be distributed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>By Domain</strong>: someone gets assigned authority and keeps it for as long as the game runs. Traditional GMing involves assigning authority for almost all domains to one person. Some early boardgamish RPGs like The Fantasy Trip suggested splitting authority between adversary and non-adversary domains. Most games give authority over individual PCs to individual players.</li>\n<li><strong>By Mechanic</strong>: when a specific condition occurs, authority passes to a person indicated by the rules. This may be based on a score, a die result, or a winner choosing between two kinds of authority. The important distinction is that the group as a whole does not know who will get the authority ahead of time, nor are they able to select who gets the authority; it is decided mechanically.</li>\n<li><strong>By Negotiation</strong>: the group as a whole decides, either by voting or by bidding. In some cases, negotiation and conflict resolution intertwine.</li>\n<li><strong>By Position</strong>: where the players are sitting determines who has authority.</li>\n<li><strong>By Time-Period</strong>: authority changes over time. This is combined with one of the other models, which determines who gets the authority at the end of the time period: the group may nominate two or more GMs ahead of time, or authority may circulate round-robin style. The time period may be fixed (new GM every session) or contingent (new GM at the beginning of the next encounter.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I can't think of any other major types, although I can think of several subtypes and combos of the above. Anyone else have suggestions?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
