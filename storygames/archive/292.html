                    Greg Stolze and I had a quick email exchange recently about riffing and grinding, the two creative processes he writes about in the Gamma World GM's guide. His condensed version:<br/>
<br/>
"Neither one is inherently better: They're just different....A grinder takes an idea and (usually in the privacy of his own home) works on it a little, polishes here, adds there, snips this bit away, glues that bit back on upside-down, polishes a little more, shows it to some colleagues, nods politely at their comments and then takes it home for further refinement.<br/>
<br/>
A riffer hears A and immediately thinks B (or 1, or 3.14156, or "purple").  Like a jazz musician, he can just pull stuff out of his ass with very little run-up time or prompting.<br/>
<br/>
Almost no one is a pure riffer or a pure grinder."<br/>
<br/>
And that totally clicked for me. I'm skewed way grinder myself, as a designer and as a player. And my wife Danielle is skewed way riffer. Which offers quite some insight into why she's stalled on the pirate rpg she's been designing. She's been trying to architect a system. And it hasn't been working. So now I'm thinking we need to figure a way for her to riff the system.<br/>
<br/>
She has some stuff on paper, but it's all disconnected. My current thinking is that she should make a list of things she thinks she needs mechanics for. Fill that list in with the stuff she already has worked out. And then we should play, with her making up temporary mechanics as necessary for the rest of the stuff on the list.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, this is a question for self-identifying riff skewed game designers? What do you think of the plan? Would it work for you? What is your own design methodology?<br/>

<br/>
There's no way. There's nothing for her to post. I don't doubt there's a game inside her, but right now it's just a snarl of gut feelings. I asked her to try and write an example of play, and she couldn't. But...I'm thinking she could correct and guide a group of players in the direction she has in mind for the game.<br/>

<p>Paul:  Ouch.  That's a hard time for a hard-core riffer.</p>
<p>I still think that people can just bounce questions off of her, and things would start to come into focus.  Or, at least, that's been my experience.</p>
<p>My experience is that the times when you're supposed to <em>know</em> what's happening are the hardest times for a riffer.  If I try to run a game with just that snarl of gut feelings, they tangle and burrow and <em>hide</em> from me.</p>
<p>But then, when I'm just shooting the shit, I get dialogues like this:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Me: Yeah, I'm gonna do this game, and it's gonna be great ... but ... y'know, I don't know why.  It's probably got something to do with how players structure the future of the story.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Sydney: Like creating armies and stuff so that war is inevitable?</p>
<p>Me:  No ... like creating a future war, so that an army is inevitable.</p>
<p>Sydney:  Oh wow.  That's ... that's a pretty wild inversion there.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Me:  Oh.  It is, isn't it?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The key for me, to riffing, is just to get talking in a low pressure environment.  I clutch when I'm called upon for <strong>the</strong> answer, but I can pull <em>an</em> answer (as you say) out of my butt at will.  If that doesn't work I just reach back into my (metaphorical) back pocket again.</p>
<p>EDIT:  If she just wants some people to bounce unformed ideas off of, we have this discussion board here, y'know.</p>

<p>I actually think a thread on a loose forum (like RPG.net or, hey, this one!) would be a spot to be riffing with virtual people. I'd participate. (And actually, I had a thread called <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=42" rel="nofollow">"Need Piratey Mechanics"</a> that was pretty much riffing with not so much focus.) So you could give that s shot.</p>

                            Yeah, I'm thinking that you need to have SOMETHING there, even just a page of hand notes. It's gotta have some sort of ideas/base/etc. From that nub, she can probably develop the rest solely by riffing (internally, or with friends). But something's gotta come out first, even if it's just a few traits and how to roll dice: Even those things can fade, change, or be wiped away, but they might help start that base.<br/><br/>Oh, and you guys got married?

                            I'm a riffer. <br/><br/>I also call it being an engineer rather than a dreamer. I don't do well at coming up things all on my own, out in the cold. But if you give me ideas I can spin off of them all day long. I can even do it in very high preasure situations, no problem. As long as I have the seed to work off of, I'm all good. <br/><br/>Getting at the seed when it's buried inside myself though? That's brutally hard. <br/><br/>The only consistant way I can do it is to go back to what I'm good at. I look at other games, other fiction, other whatever, and look at what I like and don't like about it. I compare what it does to what I want to do. I steal and retool, then I abandon to resteal and re-retool. And I do it again, and again, and again. Until finally I'm left with something that most people think is all cool and orriginal and aren't I just so creative. <br/><br/>So maybe Danielle can find some inspiration in going over other games? In looking at what they do and figuring out what kinds of ideas she can spin out of them? <br/><br/>If she's really riffing then trying to do it on her own, in the cold, creating out of nothing probably isn't going to work. Looking at other games, listening to other people's conversations, or having a Q&amp;A like Tony suggests... anything that gets her to the process where she's engaged in part of something rather than feeling the need to create from nothing is probably going to help.                        </div>

                            Here's what I do to make up homebrews. It's totally not big up front design, but it works really well.<br/>
<br/>
1. Start with a game. It doesn't really matter which one, as long as it's in the same neighborhood as the ballpark. <br/>
<br/>
2. Run it with sympatico players. <br/>
<br/>
3. Poll the players, and find out what worked and what didn't.<br/>
<br/>
4. Change exactly ONE thing about the rules to improve the game's feel, whether to fix something wrong, or to make something good better.<br/>
<br/>
5. Run it again. <br/>
<br/>
6. If the change helped, then celebrate, and go back to step 3. If the change hurt, then undo the change, and go back to step 3. <br/>
<br/>
Changing one thing at a time means that you can isolate the effects of a change -- if you make multiple changes, and things get better, you can't tell what helped and what was dead weight. <br/>
<br/>
As you iterate the process, you drift away from the original rules, and it's actually surprising how quickly the game stops looking like the original and becomes its own thing.                        </div>

                            That's where I'm at, too. Total riffer.  In fact, it is impossible for me to have a new thought.  All I do (and do well, hopefully), is combine innovative and interesting things that other people did, and make them work better, faster, smoother, cooler, or just pilfer them into a creation of my own.<br/><br/>That's one of the reasons I have all those Japanese RPGs: Most of them are filled with really cool, unique ideas (usually 1-3 per game) that I put in my "repitoire pocket" to pull out and use in other designs.  Currently the game I'm working on incorporates a character generation rule from a fantasy China game (Japanese-made), for example.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I really like the idea of just running the game and recording it, seeing what happens -- what works and what doesn't. If it's all gut-feelings now, maybe she can just sort of wing it and try stuff out with willing players.<br/>

Instead of staring at a blank page, she'll have people right there to riff off of, moment to moment.<br/>

                            I often find it helpful to make a web of concepts/ideas/thingies on paper. Basically, a bunch of circles with words in them and arrows to other circles with words, and possibly labels on the arrows, and maybe labels beside the circles...<br>

For more fun, do this with somebody else there and give them the opportunity to add stuff to the web.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hey John, what you say is good. I only want to add that my experience is that starting a group off with the empty system doesn't work very well. There's too little structure to start play off with. If you start with a system -- even something light like Over the Edge -- you have a motor that you can use to get places, even if they aren't the right places, at the right speed, or the right direction, at first.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
I begin as a riffer, but end as a gridner.  Right now I'm working on a couple of outlines and checklists for the types of games I prefer to design.  When I get something that's more tested and proven, I'll post them for others to try out.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

Hey! That is just what I've been doing recently with good success <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'd highly recommend it, and it is somewhat like drafting ideal play without the player side... hmm. Kind of a target perhaps for the play.                        </div>

<p>Really, uh, I think it is necessary to have external input to springboard from, if you're in a riffing mood. You can't jam by yourself.</p>
<p>It helps if you <em>can</em> engineer, later, because what you dream up might be insane or bizarrely cantilevered around something important, but I don't think that's necessary; it's why you need engineer friends.</p>

                            Riffer here too.   I tend to collaborate, and I do best with structure, sometimes a _lot_ of structure.  Give me a blank surface and I'm paralyzed - throw up three walls and I will _explode_ in the 4th direction.<br/>
<br/>
Easy to say, sometimes hard to address.  Things that help include having to answer fairly specific questions or to frame fairly specific situations.  These can be rules related ("How would the ship fight from master &amp; Commander Play out?") but it is often the most innocuous questions ("What do the people of Paar wear as hats?") that are most powerful because their answers spawn more questions and can really get a lot of inertia.  Tiny ideas become the irritant in the oyster shell,<br/>
<br/>
Now, that works for me, but it obviously may be of no use to your wife, but if it is, it's a concrete way that you can help her out, because questions coming from the outside are almost always more powerful because they're fresh.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, I'd look to things like Tarot, horoscopes, the cut up method or anything else that creates a pattern that the brain can latch onto and run with.  Most riffers I know are just looking for the seed that Brand so eloquently describes, and crazy stuff like that can be useful for generating it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, good luck to you both.<br/>

                            Riffing is a great design technique, but, at some point, you have to kill off the sacred cows and, in most cases, the sacred cows will be holdovers from the source of your riffing.  At least, in my experience.                        </div>

<p>I'd like to whole-heartedly back the idea of "start with another system, and then riff from there." I did this for The Shadow of Yesterday, and it worked really well. My original playtest (John Harper will remember this) was a mash of what I liked from Unisystem, Rolemaster, and D&amp;D3E. Playing it showed me what I'd need to invent.</p>
<p>Our games are all influenced by what we've played. You might as well start there.</p>
