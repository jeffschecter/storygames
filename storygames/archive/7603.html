I'm designing a system that's kind of like the Pool (well, Anti-Pool, strictly speaking). It's close enough in important bits that we can pretend that's what it is.<br/><br/>I'd like to refine a mechanic where each character has a secondary Pool called "Desperation Dice" or something similar.<br/><br/>The idea is that you don't normally roll those dice, but in desperate situations, you may choose to. You have to have your character do something desperate to roll them. In every other way, they act just like regular dice. <br/><br/>My question is, if I put that in just as written (above), will it be enough? How can I make this work?<br/><br/>I want:<br/><br/>1. The dice are rolled only rarely, and in desperate situations.<br/>2. The player really does need to come up with something pretty drastic or desperate to roll those dice.<br/>3. Rolling them is exciting, but nerve-wracking.<br/><br/>Any advice? Questions that might be helpful?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance, story-people.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168691/#Comment_168691" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T12:09:02+00:00" title="September 12, 2008 12:09PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>3.

If you are assuming that the group is creatively synergistic then I think the mechanic will work just fine.  You've assigned narrative meaning to those dice to underscore certain fictional elements.  The creatively synergistic group will understand that.  They will know that when they want to say something there is the tool to say it and they will reach for those dice only when they want to say that thing.<br/><br/>However, the less creatively synergistic the group is the more this risks devolving into comedy or awkward situations.  A player who doesn't see the set aside dice as a narrative tool will just hear, "Act Desperate = Get More Dice."  And so they will start grandstanding in inappropriate times and places when they just want something.  "I"m DESPERATE for her love!  Give me the dice."<br/><br/>In that case the mechanic usually requires more "crutches."

Do you mean that the characters would lose and gain traits as a result?<br/><br/>Jesse,<br/><br/>Absolutely right! Although your "silly" example actually sounds pretty good to me. A player rolling the dice in a contest to win someone's love is making quite a powerful statement about how much they want that person's love.<br/><br/>Maybe I'll just try it as it is.<br/><br/>Darcy and Graham,<br/><br/>You've actually reminded me of a mechanic I used to use with the Pool which I called the Doom mechanic. In it, each character had a particular Doom: a dark fate they faced. The Doom rating started at one. Any time you wanted, you could add your Doom rating (in dice) to a roll, but if the three lowest dice rolled were equal to your Doom rating or lower, your Doom would immediately take place.<br/><br/>However, this particular game is intended to be a little more light-hearted/friendly, and I definitely don't want character death to be an option.<br/><br/>This is giving me an idea, however... I will report on it once it's "congealed".<br/><br/>In the meantime, it creates two followup questions:<br/><br/>1. Could adding in-game effects to rolling the dice (as in the examples above, where rolling a "1" means character death or a similarly serious consequence) actually _detract_ from the in-fiction context? For instance, could being so focused on the die results draw attention away from the fictional conflict and the character's desperation?<br/><br/>I mean, if just rolling that die means I risk death, I might not be too concerned about what I narrate to go along with the roll.<br/><br/>2. What kinds of characters (or players) should have more/fewer Desperation dice?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168721/#Comment_168721" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T13:27:45+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  1:27PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, how does one regain Desperation dice?<br/><br/>Two thoughts come to mind:<br/><br/>1. By engaging in self-destructive behavior of some sort. Or just destructive, period. Drug abuse, violence, etc., probably different for each character.<br/><br/>2. You can regain Desperation dice by <i>deciding</i> that whatever Desperate action you took before was totally, morally acceptable. In this case, though, does it mean that you can't ever roll Desperation dice when undertaking that kind of action, or does it mean that you have to undertake more drastic action to roll them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168741/#Comment_168741" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T14:05:32+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  2:05PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played the Pool to I can't speak to its mechanics directly.<br/><br/>However, I am a big fan of games in which it <b>hurts</b> to draw on extra power.<br/><br/>So those dice are there.

What I'm imagining in my head is something really obvious when it happens and really hard to describe.  I'm talking about someone who contrives a reason to be desperate with as much frequency as he can muster and actually says "desperate" a lot exactly as I've capitalized in my original post, sometimes accompanied by leaning in and looking rapidly around the table to see if the group will let him "get away with it."  Kind of a, "I'm desperate, right guys?  eh?  eh? (nudge, nudge, wink, wink)"<br/><br/>The design consideration is if you want actual active controls in place to mitigate this kind of behavior or are willing to leave it with the training wheels off and let the group handle this kind of thing socially.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168754/#Comment_168754" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T14:43:16+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  2:43PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2008 2:45PM by Paul_T.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point, Jesse!<br/><br/>Do folks think that responding to that hypothetical player with, "So, what desperate action are you taking to 'get' her?" would be sufficient?

For some players needing to be desperate narratively will be enough.  Other players will act as Jesse describes, and for these I think it helps to have the dice enforce the desperation, by creating a risk of some kind.  Using the Desperation dice should help you win but it should also risk hurting you very badly, thus ensuring that it is something ONLY done when one is very desperate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168762/#Comment_168762" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T15:10:40+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  3:10PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Intuitively, I think you should gain a Desperation Die when you lose a roll.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168765/#Comment_168765" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T15:15:47+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  3:15PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All good points.<br/><br/>How about this:<br/><br/>Instead of it being a pool of dice, it's a resource available to you at any time. In a conflict situation, you may choose to roll some Desperation dice. Describe some desperate thing you are doing. Your opponent names a serious risk, danger, or consequence you face because of this desperate action.<br/><br/>If the dice roll (some value that's more likely if you roll more dice), regardless of success or failure, you suffer that consequence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168786/#Comment_168786" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T16:03:29+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  4:03PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about something like this, You have a growing dice pool ( ie dice are added to the pool every X, where X is something that happens reasonably often in tense or protodesperate situations ) and a hard limit on the dice pool.

Do you mean that the characters would lose and gain traits as a result?</blockquote>\nMaybe?  Typically by way of a resource, mind...    Ah, hell examples needed.  Let's look at a couple of games.<br/><br/>In DitV, you gamble with fallout at stake - when you push, your "raising" with the possibility for more of it.  Fallout can require you to change your traits.<br/><br/>In Hunter: The Reckoning, you wagered Conviction when you used a power.  If the power failed, Conviction was lost.  If you succeeded, conviction was gained.  Get enough conviction, and it translated into trait change.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that either of those mechanics is the one you want.  I AM saying that "gambling your character sheet" is a good way to get the feel of desperation; when you have the option (but aren't required) to put permanent change "on the line" in a contest, it creates intensity of a sort - if you can fine-tune that to get just the right kind of intensity, I suspect you'd be golden.<br/><br/>And no, I don't quite know how.  All I know is to wave, generally, thataway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170176/#Comment_170176" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T13:29:36+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  1:29PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, that's great advice!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
