But actually I should probably have left that line out.  I just don't like chibi freakouts / nosebleeds / magical girls / tokyo classrooms. <br/><br/>Basically, I like how in anime, and in 16-bit videogames, the character concepts are laid down very quickly with their styles.  For example, Spike's ruffled, but makes it cool.  Jet is more serious and hard-working, and the beard and bald just gives you a whole character really quickly - and specifically, it gives you stuff that I sometimes gloss over when I play story games.<br/><br/>Anyway, I guess I'm thinking... all the characters have styles that very quickly provide touchstones to what they're like.  They're broad strokes - but a different kind of broad stroke than say, a best interest or a story role (the son of a king, bereft and stripped of his rank).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238046/#Comment_238046" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T08:20:57+00:00" title="October 18, 2009  8:20AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I think I get it now. <img alt=":3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":3"/><br/><br/>Anime characters typically have some amount of physical features that in some way compliment the overall concept, and in that Cowboy Bebop is no exception. That's not really an "anime" thing per se, but I think anime has something of it's own visual language. For a really blatant example, there's a thing called an "ahoge" (\u30a2\u30db\u6bdb, literally something like "dumbass-hair"), a sprig of hair coming from the top of a character's head:<br/><img alt="Hosted by imgur.com" src="http://imgur.com/ff5aR.gif"/><br/><br/>Himeko (from the sanity-draining Pani Poni Dash) is a complete moron who's only vaguely in touch with reality, and having an ahoge is one of her defining traits. OTOH Konata from Lucky Star has one too, but she's not dumb (she's pretty smart, in fact), just too much of an otaku to apply herself to anything really useful, so there's some flexibility in what it symbolizes.<br/><br/>The more anime you know, the easier it becomes to point to the cliches in its visual language--given time I could probably list off a dozen more examples--without touching on the cheesier side of things. But as to how to bring more details into an RPG, I would suggest using the Jared Sorensen thing (from octaNe), where you give three punchy details about a character and don't bother with anything else. So Ed the super-hacker is a kid with a mop of orange hair, who moves like she's made of rubber, and speaks nonsense in a singsong voice. (She's also supposedly based on what Yoko Kanno is like in person, but that's neither here nor there.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238076/#Comment_238076" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T18:19:34+00:00" title="October 18, 2009  6:19PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Neko, do you have any advice on what's "punchy" or not?

Stick to the stuff that's in some way interesting and/or informs what the character is like. Only mention a character's weight if he's especially fat or skinny and it's important to the character. Mention the hairstyle if there's something interesting/distinctive about it (if you're limiting yourself to 3 details, Faye's hairstyle might not make the cut on the character sheet), or the red scarf the character wears, or her mismatched red and blue eyes, or his piercing glare, or her catlike grin.

You can still leave it up to interpretation, but at least there's a structure there.<br/><br/>For example, in Do there is a similar gimmick as what you're talking about. Instead of hair style, a character's name tells you a lot about their personality. The verbs in Do are "get into trouble" and "help people out of trouble." Each character has a two-word nickname like "Curious Eagle" or "Stainless Steel."<br/><br/>The first word in that nickname is a metaphor for how the character gets into trouble. The second word is a metaphor for how she helps people out of trouble. So, let's use Pilgrim Ryu the Stainless Steel as an example. "Stainless" means he gets into trouble by being fastidiously clean. He can't stand seeing a single speck of dust or something out of place, so he's always nervously fidgeting trying to keep those urges in check. "Steel" notes that he always carries his family's ancestral wok with him at all times, finding creative ways to use it as a tool to solve problems.<br/><br/>Flipping this around as a hair thing, you could do something like this, too. If your verb is "bounty hunting," then the hair styles all reflect different ways characters pursue their quarry. Spike has a frizzy hairdo, meaning he's very lackadaisical and relaxed about the hunt. He is confident in himself that he will stumble across the bounty in due time, without needing to stress out too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238125/#Comment_238125" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T06:54:53+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  6:54AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2009 6:55AM by Ry.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome.<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>"No one cares that your character weighs 147 pounds."</blockquote>That's the guideline I was looking for.
