Besides a similarity to <i>Heavy Gear</i>, it doesna't resemble any other system I'm familiar with. But its simple enough I assume something has already been built around it already (especially with the favor for die pools and D6's among inde games). Does this look familar to anyone?\n<blockquote>The player rolls some six-siders, more is better. Players will generally be rolling two dice, sometimes one (if they lack ability), sometimes four (if they have a lot of ability). The GM rolls a similar number of dice.<br/><br/>From their respective pools, both the GM and player pick their single highest rolling die. If multiple sixes are rolled, each extra one adds +1 to the high roll (thus, rolling 6, 6 &amp; 6 = 8). If the player's highest die equals or exceeds the GM's, their character suceeds.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109701/#Comment_109701" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T15:10:46+00:00" title="November 26, 2007  3:10PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The silhouette system, by Dream Pod 9, I think.

I've sketched out a workable unambitious system around it already, but the real effort is the book I'd like to build around it, a beginner's introduction to RPG's. A lot of discussion and essays about what the hobby is and how to make it work, for which the game system is just there to be illustrative, unintimidating and intentionally derivitive (serving to illustrate concepts common to many other games).

It points out some interesting bits about the dice probabilities involved.\n<blockquote><cite>JohnDeHope3</cite>My only beef with this system is that you need opposed rolls, because you can't take a number-of-dice and derive an average roll from it. Well you can, but the averages are so tightly centered around 4/5/6 that you need a lot of dice to produce unusual target <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23s&amp;Mode=like">#s</a>. But for simplicity, ease of rolling, and ease of explanation, this is a pretty good mechanic in my experience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>MadUnkieG</cite>I played in a <i>Heavy Gear</i> game for a while, and this fits my experience perfectly. The bias towards that range [4,5 and 6] is so great that it can actually be a touch bland. There was a thread on this forum [rpg.net] that said they found the mechanic worked better with d8s (d10s aren't bad, either), but DP9 went with d6s because it's a commonly liked die type. Frankly, I find a lot of gamers have a good supply of d10s, so I'd suggest switching. An advantage of this system is that it works well in irc channels when compared to exploding dice (like <i>Shadowrun</i>'s old dice) because of the lack of rerolls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Anwar</cite>I have played silhouette (<i>Tribe 8</i> to be specific) with d8s instead of d6s. Went much smoother than before, especially because modifiers weren't THAT huge anymore (a +1 bonus is really large because of the (noted) bias towards 4/5/6). Also it stretched the expected results from 4/5/6/7 to about (4)/5/6/7/8/9 leading to a bit more variety in results. Overall I can VERY much recommend this mechanic with d8s (dunno about d10s, should be alright though).<br/></blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>E.T.Smith</cite>Now that you mention it, I remember reading that [suggestion about switching to D8's] a few times as well, even from the designer's own (virtual) mouth. As I recall, the stated reason for DP9 knowingly going with less optimal D6's in <i>Heavy Gear</i> was that they were competeing directly with <i>Battletech</i>; they wanted the transition easy for gamers who already had lots of D6's from playing BT.<br/><br/>I'm operating under similar parameters. I'd like to use the mechanic being discussed to make a sample system in an introductary guide to RPG's, so skipping funky-dice is important and I'll thus stick with the sub-por but functional D6's. Though I like the idea of including a sidebar that explains this quirk of probability, and informs the reader of the option of using D8's instead. Nice way to start them thinking about why system design works the way it does and to consider personal modifications.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109983/#Comment_109983" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T08:16:39+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  8:16AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given the issue with the above approach and D6's, you might want to think about swiping the dice pool mechanism from <a href="http://www.wiseturtle.com/ricochet.html" rel="nofollow">Ricochet</a>/OVA (summarized <a href="http://wiseturtle.razornetwork.com/viewtopic.php?p=3360#3360" rel="nofollow">here</a>).
