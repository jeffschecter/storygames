I guess that sums up my "strategy" pretty well. To pay regular rates would imply doing regular publishing; I don't really know if I'm going to sell ten copies or a thousand copies of something I make, and whether art has anything to do with it or not is a mystery, so it's difficult to justify more than a minimal art investment on fiscal grounds. Therefore I tend to focus on creating the product I envision as artistically optimal, and that seems to usually involve such weird art-like things that paying for them would be questionable anyway.<br/><br/>I'm actually half-seriously wondering if I should pay for a Larry Elmore style cover art for a little game I'm making. Friends tell me that they know people who would want to illustrate something like that, but it's one of those cases where I'm not so convinced that I'd want to pay enough to be able to demand the kind of quality I'd want. Probably I'll just end up putting together something weird and cheap in-house.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment"

The OP is from the perspective of an <i>artist</i> looking for advice <i>getting hired</i>, rather than self-publishing game-designer looking for advice hiring.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>... and how much would you pay for it?</p></div></blockquote>\nI think there's three general cases you can meet here.<br/><br/>The first, and probably rarest, are people who self-/publish games professionally (not necessarily as their day job - perhaps as a sustainable second job). They're probably operating at a tight budget to make a tiny profit and stay in the business - how much of that budget they destinate to artwork I'm sure varies a lot case by case, and I'm also pretty much sure they already have artists they're accustomed to working with. They might be open to considering a new illustrator if contacted in a more "professional" fashion, perhaps by writing to their publishing-name e-mail (as found on their website) and shown a portfolio.<br/><br/>Then there's people who are doing - or would like to do - it as a hobby, who have a profitable enough day job so that they've set a budget aside for future self-publishing. Especially if it's their first release, they might be willing to operate at a loss to have their dream of a nice-looking book fulfilled (what's called "vanity press" in the publishing industry) rather than tightly balance their expenses. Due to RPG publishing traditions, artwork is probably the one item such a person is willing to spend the most on! What matters to them is your work matches their vision <i>exactly</i> - so, again, start by showing your work around, this time perhaps in a publicly visible fashion.<br/><br/>Finally, there's people operating on zero budget (students doing it as a hobby, perhaps, or people like me who'd like to make it "professional" but haven't so far managed to). Should you publicly post an offer to draw illustrations for something <i>other</i> than an upfront payment - a barter of services, perhaps, or a royalty on future sales - you'll probably attract such people by the dozen, like a campfire does moths. It's entirely up to you, though, to discern which of us are actually up to something, and therefore worth your time.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Also, what kind of things you look for in an artist besides affordable prices and being able to meet deadlines? <br/><br/>I posted this in directed promotion because I'm looking for small gigs, though I don't meant to bother anyone by actually posting links nor samples of my artwork here.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI believe any self-publishing authors who actually have options (i.e. a budget to spend) look for artists whose work matches their vision. It is a fact - a sad one, perhaps - that we tend to expect "more of the same" of any creative person.<br/>Thus, I don't believe you can avoid showing your work first. If looking for actual paying gigs online, as a visual artist, assembling an online portfolio is your necessary first step.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470205/#Comment_470205" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-24T19:39:25+00:00" title="February 24, 2018  7:39PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2018 7:40PM by AsIf.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed on the portfolio.

I have to produce too much stuff to "cruise Deviant Art" or look at artist's portfolios.  Maybe game designers have more time for their babies or have some insight that I lack about finding this stuff, but I have weekly dead-lines.  For CC'd art, I try to contact the artist first, if at all possible, out of courtesy (even though technically it isn't necessary)--but sometimes I think they have died or left their site or work to go fallow--occasionally I get no response.  I usually use search-engines' image-searches to find the work, so I would suggest if you want your work to be credited properly, to develop a relationship with client/users, and to perhaps even paid, that it would be wise to make sure any files (images, photos, etc) have the proper EXIF data and properties tab filled out.  Because your files can end up on someone else's site without proper attribution, having your email available on your own website isn't really enough, this is important to remember.  There is no way for a client to develop a relationship with an artist if the work is left to drift alone in the wilderness of the Internet.  If I can't get a response from the artist, or can't even figure out who to contact, then I drop the image and move on to one that I can.  It's a shame really.

Most of the pro illustration community is active on Tumblr, and one of the ways that artists at all levels get commissions there is by posting fanart. <a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a> hit it on the head on a lot of points, but especially that people generally want more of the same from artists. People like things that they already like, so use that to your advantage by illustrating pop culture subjects in your own style. If people dig what you're doing, they'll want you to do other things in the same style (including paid work for them!)<br/><br/>If you generate enough work to post at least weekly, you should also consider Twitter and Instagram. Just make sure you're posting the kinds of things you want to get paid to do. Drawing a series of RPG characters could be a good start. Maybe make and post some character portraits whenever you play a game \u2013\xa0it's good practice and it shows people what you're into.<br/><br/>Also, I cannot stress this enough, <i>charge for your work</i>. If this is just a hobby, it's fine to do it for free, but if you're serious about getting paid do artwork, you need to charge a (reasonable) fee for every job.<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
