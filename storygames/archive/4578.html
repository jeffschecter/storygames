Let me start by saying that I have absolutely no delusions that WotC actually stole the idea from me. Indeed, I'm sure some representative percentage of playgroups were already doing this, but I'm still pleased (I can at least be pleased, can't I?) that "great minds think alike".<br/><br/>From <a href="http://www.bluedevilgames.com/passages" rel="nofollow">Passages</a>, page 12, "Spread":\n<blockquote>In some cases, it is enough to simply know if the character has succeeded or failed at what he was trying to do. However, the result of any check also indicates the degree of success or failure. The difference between the result of the check and the DC is called the spread.</blockquote>\nAnd page 228, "Interpret the Results":\n<blockquote>If the check succeeds and the spread is minimal, the character has accomplished the task but only barely. Describe it in those terms. Describe how the character strainted to hold his grip on the ledge just catching himself before he plummeted to his doom. (Now that you know the character has succeeded, you can make the effect o failure that much more horrific.) Describe how the queen creases her brow and mutters to herself as she acquiesces to teh character's request. A narrow success creates a welcome tension at the table, as if the character doged a bullet--sometimes literally so.<br/><br/>If the check succeeds and the spread is great, the character has been wildly successful. Describe it in those terms. Describe how the woman in the front row faints from his eloquent recitation of the poem. Describe the mouthwatering smells as he not only catches a wild boar for their dinner but creates a meal fit for a gourmand. This is a chance for the character to soak up the spotlight. At least for this moment, he is the star.<br/><br/>Failure also has its place. Narrow failures can be gut-wrenching as something critical slips free from the character's grasp or infuriating as the character just fails to nab the villain before he escapes. Great failures can be moments of levity as the character bumbles about like a drunken sot. And of course, great failures can leave to teh gravest sort fo danger as the character's life very is jeopardized.</blockquote>\nAnd from the <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/215397200" rel="nofollow">Rules Compendium</a>, page 29, "Dicey Narration" by Chris Sims:\n<blockquote>In D&amp;D, the system is largely binary--yes or no--so it's usually an all-or-nothing outcome when the d20 rolls. However, the degree of success or failure can always matter in your game. All you have to do, as DM, is use the degree of success or failure to determine how you describe the action. A leaper who fails a Jump check by 1 might have missed the other side, but only by inches. That's different from stretching for the landing when failing by 4, even though a jumper that fails by 4 or less needs to clamber up after just catching the other side. If two enemies are scrambling for the same iterm, you might use a Dexterity check. If the winner only wins by 1, that's an opportunity for you to make it quesitonable who grabs the iterm for an intense second or two. When a climber fails by 6, you can even make the player think everything's fine after a slight slip--right before that second slide turns into a real fall.<br/><br/>This narrative style isn't just for checks. In combat, near misses make the scene more real. They also give your players hints at what they really need to roll to hit the bad guy, a guessing game that can make missing a little less disappointing.</blockquote>\nAnyway, I thought that was cool.<br/><br/>I'll also use this as my mini-review to note that I was quite pleased with the RC. It's very handy, the few minor omissions don't really bother me, and I found the sidebars and design notes (lile the one above) to be pure gold.<br/><br/><i>EDIT: Changed the lame thread title.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103642/#Comment_103642" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T08:40:35+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  8:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure this has been in WotC books before, if not the DMG, for some time now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Most of the time, the only outcome that matters is whether the character succeeds or fails.</blockquote>\nAnd "Degrees of Failure":\n<blockquote>Usually failure itself is a sufficient problem and does not need to be compounded. However, failure can sometimes cause additional problems, such as a [sic] setting off a strap or alterting a snetry to the characters' presence. When such consequences exist, a check that fails by 5 or more causes them to occur. For example, if Lidda the rogue misses a Disable device check by 5 or more, she sets off the trap she's trying to disable. </blockquote>\nAnd that Disable Device example is specifically provided for in the skill description.<br/><br/>The idea that the degree of success or failure can be relevant to any check and that it informs the narrative description is entirely new. (At least until I can be proven otherwise. It wouldn't shock if it's somewhere arcane, but it's certainly not part of the core rules.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

I just started up a Pathfinder campaign and instituted a few new rules. One of them is that players narrate their successes. So, the player makes the check. If it succeeds, I say "success" (or "small success" or "narrow success" as the circumstances dictate), and the player describes the actual in-game action. So far, it's worked pretty well. We realized early on that every hit on a goblin does not require explicit narration; we wait for the meaningful checks to switch over.<br/><br/>We are also using the Paizo Critical Hit Deck. (Basically, on a critical hit, instead of rolling additional damage, you draw a card from the deck with a variety of results.) One of the players critted a poor goblin, drew "trible damage but you drop your weapon" and narrated how he plunged his sword into the goblins sternum, the goblin shrieked back in a death throe, and the blade lodged between the goblin's ribs, yanking it from the cleric's grasp. Very nice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104216/#Comment_104216" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T17:37:49+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  5:37PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.

But I'm going off my convention-going experience and it's probably the case that there are many groups that have not yet and will never encounter these techniques without them being in the core rulebook. But while I agree that it's significant that they're codyfing it, that's too little too late for me as far as D&amp;D is concerned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

The closest is the skill challenge section, but if anything, that's a more codified system then the existing d20 one. I.e., it doesn't inform the narrative it provides a tangible mechanical benefit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104929/#Comment_104929" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T21:45:38+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  9:45PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.

Which also matches the claim that everything in the Rules Compendium has seen print before--it's supposedly nothing new, just a compilation, so while i don't know where, i'm pretty sure it's seen print from WotC at some point in the past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
