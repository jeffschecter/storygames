                    Hello,<br/><br/>Last night something briefly came up at our PtA game and I've occasionally seen a similar idea floated through various threads elsewhere.  The idea is a player prefering to see their character fail in certain situations.  I'm going to have to admit that this is a totally bizzare an alien thing to me but I think I'm going to have to clearify a lot to communicate where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>First of all I do not equate character success with winning.  To me character success and failure is purely a property of the fiction.  Either my character fullfills his agenda or he doesn't.  Winning and Losing is a property of the real people at the table.  Those concepts are an ego assertion about an individual's real-world skill.  Either I played the game well and I won or I played the game poorly and I lost.  I do not give a damn about winning and losing.  I care boatloads about seeing my character succeed.<br/><br/>I'd also like to clearify that this has nothing to do with "Immersion" either.  In the pursuit of fulling my character's agenda I want to account for all the meta-game concerns along the way.  In a Sorcerer game I consider the Humanity ramifications of my character's agenda.  I consider carefully my character's agenda and how I wish to have him pursue it impacts the other player's characters.  And so forth.<br/><br/>This also doesn't mean that I don't enjoy the consequnces of failure.  In fact I hate cheating opportunities for failures.  I've been in games where I've felt like certain sections were rushed or too much was resolved in a single go and that although all of that worked out in my character's favor, I felt like we were skipping opportunities for my character to confront adversity.<br/><br/>The bottom line is, I've realized that I greatly dislike being complicit in my character's failure (Not the same, by the way, as being given narrative rights over the consequences of failure ala Trollbabe.  I'm fine with that).  I want to grapple with adversity and opposition genuinely, honestly and with gusto and I can't do that if I'm partially invested in that opposition.  Hell, to me, that's WHY there's a randomized element to an RPG so that in the zeal of my character's pursuits the game will slap me down and say, "Actually, no that doesn't quite work out the way you want."  I enjoy this so that when my character DOES fail, I'm shocked into having to re-evaluate that character, to have him change and grow.  I can't remember who or what my co-worker was quoting when he said, "I enjoy gambling not for the thrill of winning but for how alive I feel when I lose," but that pretty much sums up my relationship with my characters.<br/><br/>So, what is your relationship to your character like?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>

                            Funny, I think I agree with <i>all</i> of your baseline reasons (wanting to face real adversity without fighting with one hand tied behind your back, particularly) but not your conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
It's possible to face real adversity, and lose fair and square, while still wanting your character to fail at what they're trying.  It just requires (as you rightly point out) that you decouple the idea of you winning from the idea of your character succeeding.<br/>
<br/>
Most simple possible example:  How about if you, the player, are fighting to make your character fail (using all of his bad traits) and your opposition is fighting to make him succeed?  I mean ... it's not like you have the right to <b>declare</b> that he fails.  You might have to fight for it.  You might lose, and be forced to watch your character succeed.  I've been in that situation, though it's not common.<br/>
<br/>
Other examples are easier to see come up in real play, even if they're a little more difficult to understand:  Sometimes what you, the player, want to have happen is completely independent of your character's intent.  Like, your character wants to track down a secret council of conspirators, but what you the player want is for him to learn a lesson in humility.  There are at least four possible outcomes there:  He learns a lesson in humility that helps him to find the conspirators, he learns a lesson in humility by utterly failing to find the conspirators, his arrogance reins unchecked as he finds the conspirators or his unchecked arrogance prevents him from finding the conspirators.  You could totally want him to fail to find the conspirators, because it would give you some advantage (either tactical in the system or just in the nature of the narration) toward winning your goal of teaching him humility.  I see <i>that</i> kind of thing happen all the time.<br/>
<br/>
And ... that's what my relationship with my character is like, I guess.                        </div>

                            I love to watch my characters fail, really I do.  I often play characters who are troubled and imperfect, and who end up more troubled and imperfect.  Recently I played a guy who wanted, more than anything, for his brother to forgive him and love him again.  That's what he worked for, and eventually he got it.  Unfortunately, his brother was an evil bastard and the things he had to do to win his brother back destroyed an entire kingdom.  He ended up thrown into hell for his crimes.  I loved that, and it was totally avoidable - I could have engineered it so that my guy saw through his brother's evil, bought off a key or two, and fought the good fight.  So in Tony's astute little table, I chose get brother back/fuck everything up, which was fantastic, and opened up a lot of interesting play for others as well.  Don't get brother back/be awesome, get brother back, be awesome, and don't get brother back/fuck everything up just seem pale in comparison.                        </div>

                            I'm with Jason on this one, I often like to play my characters like Shakespearian tragedies. I role-play like some people go to NASCAR races; hoping for a magnificent wreck. My twisted masochistic love of character failure has little to do with overcoming (or failing to overcome) obstacles or adversity; some of my favorite gaming â€˜car-wrecksâ€™ were wholly pre-ordained. There were no challenges I â€˜failed to overcomeâ€™, often my characterâ€™s hubris or arrogance destroyed him without any chance of escape.<br><br>Itâ€™s like Jenga. Itâ€™s fun to build the teetering tower, but itâ€™s much more fun watching it all come crashing down. And no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, it WILL come crashing down. That's just how the game ends.<br><br>Edit: Oh, I'd also like to point out I dislike playing 'bad-guys'. It's no fun if the character deserves to be crushed by fate. It's just not <i><b>tragic</b> </i>then <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Well, I'd like to reiterate that I do enjoy seeing my characters fail.  Failure is an opportunity, not a stop point.  I think what I'm against is trying to engineer large chunks of theme in one go, rather than let theme be the sum of individual conflicts.  For example, I might very well come to think my character is a bastard and deserves some humility.  But I still prefer to play him with the intent of him succeeding in his agenda.  Because if he fails, then I smile and say, "Yeah, he deserved that."  If, however, he succeeds, "I think, WOW, what a horror story.  I can't believe the bastard got away with it."<br><br>See, I dislike playing for outcome other than "Does my character achieve what he wants at this moment."  Deciding what the character wants and how the character plans to go about achieving it is subjected to a wide variety of factors from meta-game system considerations to my personal view of the character to whatever.  But I prefer stakes, resolution, etc to be purely rooted in what I think my character wants to achieve.<br><br>Now that I think about it, I think a lot of this is rooted in this discussion here: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1199" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1199</a><br/><br/>I largely agree with Ron in that dislike stakes and resolution that are not tied to conflict of interests between characters within the fiction.  "Does my character find humility?"  Is not an interesting stake to me.  However, "Does Jane make my character realize he needs to find some humility?" is VERY interesting to me.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Jesse, <br/><br/>I think you're also onto a lot the same track as Vincent's talk about knowing the story you're telling as you tell it (or even before you tell it) and not knowing the story until after the dust has settled. (<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=259" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=259</a> if you haven't seen it.) <br/><br/>You don't want to chose to have your character fail because that would be knowing the story before it happens. If your character does fail, that's fine, but you don't want to have done it because its what should happen, you want it to happen as an emergent property of the joint story. <br/><br/>Am I close?                        </div>

                            Yeah, I think Brand put his finger on it.<br/><br/>In our recent <em>Primetime Adventures</em> game, my character had his spotlight episode at the season finale.  The whole season, from my perspective, had been building up to it.  I stocked up on fan mail and I seeded the developing situation so I knew I'd have access to all my edges and connections.  I went into the conflict with TEN CARDS.  And I got two red cards, and lost the conflict.  Jesse (the Producer) and everybody else at the table thought that it was awesome, and what an incredible turnabout to explore in the next season and so on.  I, on the other hand, was rather perturbed that a season's worth of build up, planning, and gaming the system as much as I was able to ended up with me not getting what I wanted.  I already knew the story arc that I wanted to see, and my desire to see it was thwarted by a bad hand.  I was totally looking for the 'know the story ahead of time' experience, while everybody else was looking to see it develop.  Apparently I didn't get the memo!                        </div>

                            I think this is a really interesting thread and it's made me think about the way my group play and what they want.<br/><br/>I've been gaming with the same 4 people almost exclusively for about a year now.  Their reactions are all different.<br/><br/>Stuart is what you might call an immersionist.  He seems to be willing to put up with an awful lot in terms of crappiness when it comes to games.  Sessions, for example, where nothing really happens don't seem to bother him.  He seems to view his character's failures as inevitable.  That is, there are odds of failure, so it's bound to happen every now and then.  Failure, for Stuart, is just part of the game because things just sometimes go wrong in RPGs.<br/><br/>Dave on the other hand is all about the story.  He actually seems to revel in his character's failures.  Last week's Don't Rest Your Head game started with his character being surrounded by cannibal hobos and he lost the first two conflicts, was wrestled to the ground and force-fed deep fried human hands.  He loved it, riffed off it and narrated how gross and icky his character felt after waking up with grease and fingernails all over his beard.<br/><br/>Claire's very much about the game.  To her, losing is either a shortcoming in her strategy or bad luck.  She accepts that in order for a success to mean anything, there has to be the possibility of failure, but want to avoid that failure whenever possible.  That is, she sees that she ought to stack the odds in her favour however the system allows.<br/><br/>It's pretty interesting to see the three player's different takes on things.                        </div>

                            I think Brand is wrong. Even if Jesse thinks he's right.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I think that Jesse and Brand, and I all hate to pre-determine how play will go. But JBR doesn't, and that's not the point.<br/>
<br/>
Because one could pre-determine success, and that would be the same problem as predetermining failure. What we're talking about here is the role of advocate for one sort of story outcome vs. another.<br/>
<br/>
I've talked about this subject a lot, because it's important to Hero Quest and how it works. So I think I've got it.<br/>
<br/>
Jesse likes to be in the player role of advocate for the character's success. Like the reader watching Frodo struggle with getting the ring across Gorgoroth, he wants to both root for Frodo, but love his failures when they happen. Yeah, he also doesn't want to know if Frodo makes it in the end or not, and to have it "play out." But that's beside the point. As a player of a RPG with the ability to affect the equation of whether or not Frodo wins, we want to be in the role of the person who is causing the success part, and we want the GM to be in the role of the person who causes the failures.<br/>
<br/>
Because, "Immersion" aside, we do identify with the character. If we didn't at all, we wouldn't be interested in the events at all. The player's characters are, on some level, protagonists. So we have to sympathize with them.<br/>
<br/>
Now, some players see their role as more "author" than "audience" to their character (questions of "actor" aside). And these players may, at times, take a more active hand in forging their characters failures. But for others, they want to stick on the side of "protagonist success promotion." This is understandable.<br/>
<br/>
And it's not equating it to "winning." Tony, you're not believing Jesse, but it's the truth. You can want to have only part of the role of advocacy for your character's story, and only want it to be the positive side, and still not think of it as "winning" if he does succeed, but just as doing your part in fulfiling the character's destiny.<br/>
<br/>
Now, at the risk of sounding like a shill for HQ, I'll demonstrate how, in theory, the game system promotes this. Actually it's not 100% perfect in this, but it does a pretty good job. Basically, the player's job in a contest is to discover what abilities the character has that he can augment with. He's coming up with the "plusses" that show us the cool facets of the character, and how he interacts with the contest.<br/>
<br/>
The narrator's job is to establish the resistance and other bonuses and penalties. He is, as a "less-closely-involved" player in the character's destiny, allowed to adjust up or down, etc, but always advocates generally for plausibility to make the story good because it's believable.<br/>
<br/>
So you have these opposed roles for these players in the game: the player provides the impetus to win, and the GM provides the impetus for danger, conflict, and plausibility.<br/>
<br/>
Then there's a bit of tension (this is where things become a little less clear). Does the player try to find every augment he can? Does he go "trolling" his character sheet looking to find every little augment he can come up with, so his character can win? No, in theory he's only interested in adding abilities to the extent that he's showing the interesting facets of the character, and keeping the events plausible as well.<br/>
<br/>
What forces keep the player in line here? Well, for one the narrator can disallow or penalize augments and oddly used abilities. In this way the narrator can signal the player if he seems to be trolling to win that he's no longer playing the role of protagonist success force, and has slipped into playing to win for himself as player. Second, it's simply too easy to augment a lot usually. That is there's no player challenge to going down the entire list of abilities and complaining until you get them as augments. Players realize this immediately, it seems to me. The answer to "well, why shouldn't I troll?" is seen right off as, "Well, because it's easy and dull. And the narrator will tell me not to."<br/>
<br/>
As I say, this isn't 100% the most solid system to promote this.<br/>
<br/>
Hero Points are another example of the tension on a player - does he alwyas bump, if it means making the character do better? Well, sure, in theory. But in practice players don't bump. Not because they're engineering failures, precisely. But because they have a limited number of HP, and they have an alternative use for the HP (developing the character), that's just as good a use of them in promoting character success over the long haul.<br/>
<br/>
So you don't have to feel "guilty" if you don't bump that you're being a part of the negative side of the equation. You can say, "I'm saving them for something more important later, or to add abilties to the character to make him even cooler." You're simply deciding in which way to use the resources to make the character a success and cool.<br/>
<br/>
So that's my theory on why HQ seems to promote this sort of play so well. You can unabashedly be on the side of the character, and always promote him, but yet still be part of the process of forging his story, and not simply trying to "play to win."<br/>

                            Mike, <br><br>I'm actually reminded of a conversation I had with Ben about Polaris in which I asked what a Mistaken is supposed to do when dealing with a Heart whose player is always screwing the Heart as hard as he can. His answer was, "make them win." <br><br>As long as there is opposition I think that you can want anything you want for your character and still have a game based emergent fiction. (Woah, jargon alert.) Its just that there is a broken parallelism in the structural logic of having to fight to win for a character, but being able to lose at will.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Interestingly in HQ, you often can't lose at will. Try as hard as one might, in fact, you still might win many contests. I mean...you can try to lose in D&amp;D if you like. Using healing spells when there's only 1 HP lost. Using weak weapons. Not wearing armor when it's available. Etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know that a game has to prevent you from intentional losing to make sense. Not sure even how that would work in many cases. In HQ, the only times you can "lose at will" again, you have the "excuse" that you were saving up to win elsewhere or for other character promotional ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I say this because, yes, if in fact you are as strongly promoted to defeat your character as to support the character, then I could see where that might feel very strange for a player of Jesse's bent. He might feel that he's "playing to win" if he's always pushing success, when he has the option to lose. But in HQ, everything can be seen from a perspective of doing good by the character.<br/>
<br/>
Now, will everyone feel that way? Heck no, some people play HQ with gamism directly, from what I've heard. But my point is that I can at least see a perspective from which a "pro-character-only" player can find the model acceptable, and still be supporting theme creation over gamism.<br/>
<br/>
Note that there may be a fine line between this and "accidental theme production" in gamism ala Pantheon. But I think it's a real phenomenon and not a rationalization.<br/>

                            Mike, <br><br>I've seen lots of games (not rules, games) in which players can chose to have their characters fail rather than roll a contest. <br><br>GM: You have to make a melee roll with an 18 if you want to beat him...<br>Player: No, that's okay, he can kick my ass and take me hostage. <br>GM:... Um... okay, so he does....<br><br>In this case what you're dealing with is not using mechanical resolution for any situation where the player wants the character to fail. This is different than using mechanical resolution and hoping that your character fails. However, the two do often get conflated together. I've had a lot of players ask me, when I told them to roll anyway, why they should have to if they want to lose. In their mindset you're engaging in mechanical resolution to win -- the goal is still the old sim/trad based one of "getting the goal of the character by earning it with success." So if they don't want that, they don't see why they should need to engage. This has something to do with the winning a losing issue, but is about the structure of it rather than the feeling of it (two other things that sometimes get conflated). <br><br>My example with Ben was intended to point out how some systems specifically derail this thought. As the Mistaken in Polaris you are supposed to be opposition to the player, not the character. So if the Heart wants to screw the Heart Character your job is to make sure the Heart character doesn't get screwed. You fight for the character to win, because thats where the tension and emergent fiction comes from. <br><br>After that there are games in which you can use mechanical resolution with greater or lesser degrees of control over the loss of your character. You cite HeroQuest and D&amp;D, and do a decent job of describing how they handle it. They're both very heavy on fortune and have a high degree of randomization in resolution, and so fit the model you describe. However, to get a broader perspective take a quick look at Dogs and With Great Power. <br><br>In WGP one of Michael's stated objectives was to allow players to (mostly) be able to throw conflicts without having to abandon mechanical resolution. Thus the use of a hand of cards to play from, rather than a fully random dice roll or card draw. By having the ability to chose a really low card you have more ability to make your character lose in any given situation. Play a deuce in an enrichment scene and it's unlikely that the GM can force you to win. If you want to lose, chances are decent you can make your character lose. It isn't, however, guaranteed. I've heard AP reports where players get stuck with a mitt full of 10s when they're wanting to toss and have to win even when they really want the character to bite it. <br><br>Now, in Dogs if you go into a conflict wanting your character to lose, it can be really difficult to stop you from doing just that. You can be sitting on the world's hugest heap of 10s in your pool and say, "I give." Just like that, your character has lost the conflict. The only thing the GM (or opposing PC) can do to stop you is to give first. (Its funny to watch two players obviously intending to do this, but also wanting to rack up fallout first trying to decide if they should take more fallout or give....) Now, this may be viewed by some groups (maybe by Jesse, for example) as short-circuiting the system. If you're in a conflict its assumed you wanted to be in it, right? But what if you don't? What if you just want to lose and tell everyone from the get go? Well then, why roll when all you want is failure (unless you also want fallout)? You're back to the situation I described back up at the top. <br><br>So the truth is that some games do let you lose on purpose and have it still let story be emergent, but others don't, and not all games do it in the same way. And everyone has to decide what they do when the call a conflict against a characters interest and the player just says, "Screw it, I want my character to lose." And, as Jesse points out, this may not be just an issue of dealing with that players single request -- but can help decide CA for the whole table.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            As a note to the above, I don't think you have to fight to win for your character in order to make fiction emergent from the game. Nor to address premise from it. A game with a well set fruitful void will get a lot of grist either way. There is, however, a difference in how that void will get filled and the types of choices your SC finds acceptable and not. <br><br>Me, I go back and forth on what I want from game to game, but make sure to stay constant within any given game. Any game that has strong mechanics that tie to theme in which the assumption is that as default (if not always) you want your character to win, I may have issues with players throwing conflicts. In Hero's Banner, for example, it can be a problem if players always want their character to lose, because without taking the rerolls they won't up their passion as fast as those who are passionately fighting for their character. If you're sticking with the game's recommendation to end-game all the PCs at close to the same time, this can be a real problem. It's even more of a problem if the players don't want to have the contest at all and just lose without rolling. At that point the game's system starts to clunk. <br><br>OTOH, when playing something like Exalted or Buffy and someone says, "Screw it, let them capture me" I just take it as scene-framing and move the exciting escape.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'm neither saying that one must fight for one's character to cause stuff to emerge, nor that some games don't allow you to lose intentionally in a mechanical way. Just that I understand the urge to fight for one's character, and that some systems do support it.<br/>
<br/>
If you want that effect, play with an appropriate system. HQ also works for the "engineer failure" player, as well as the "always fight for character" player.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Oh, I think that Jesse and Brand, and I all hate to pre-determine how play will go. But JBR doesn't, and that's not the point.<br/></blockquote>
To be fair, I think I'm in Josh's court on this one, and it's not from a love of pre-determined play.  It's the chair-lift of the gamist part of the game.  It's part of what ruined <cite>the Roach</cite> for me when I played it.  You put these chip in front of me, and tell me that to win I need the most of them, and then the actual mechanics of the game mean that, first of all, I can't meaningfully maneuver such that I can hope to achieve that goal and secondly, my attempts to do so push the story to this fever pitch of wackiness.  Because if you put that kind of gamable system in front of me, I've got a huge ring for that hook.  I can completely empathize with Josh's issue: <cite>Prime Time Adventures</cite> lays out a decided game in front of you, and the prize is getting what you want to happen.  Josh played five episodes wrangling the system to achieve something specific, and the vagaries of chance snatched victory away - made all the more poignant because he a big emotional investment in that victory and the story-outcome it entailed.   <br><br>Or at least, that's where I'd be in his shoes.<br><br>Relating that back to topic, it seems then that <cite>Prime Time Adventures</cite> can encourage a player to invest in one outcome over another by marrying it to the game in the system.  So it essentially marries winning for the player to some outcome for the character in a really big way.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

His answer was, "make them win."<br><br>As long as there is opposition I think that you can want anything you want for your character and still have a game based emergent fiction. (Woah, jargon alert.) Its just that there is a broken parallelism in the structural logic of having to fight to win for a character, but being able to lose at will.</br></br></br></br></blockquote>
We had a lot of this in the last game of Polaris I played.  It did seem a little problematic, because it didn't seem like the Heart player naturally threw in for all one way (i.e. against the PC's interests) or all the other way (i.e. for the PC's interests).  Instead, you'd have a bunch of cases where the Mistaken says something terrible, and then the player grins and accepts it.  <br><br>This removes some of the challenging element of play.  <br><br>The emergent thing is a bit of a red herring, in my opinion.  Even if all the conflict resolutions are decided rather than randomized, you can still have emergent story from the complex interaction of different players' inputs.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

In PTA there is a functional currency, but it isn't really designed to be gamed hard.

                            I am also not sure that PTA's procedure doesn't accomodate preferred outcomes. If you had one, couldn't you just make sure it was handled at the episode pitch? (Or during a commercial break?)                        </div>

                            All fairness to Jason, I think my issues with the Roach are local to myself and the table I played with.  <br><br>Presented with a system that asks to be treated like a game - and in the Roach it says "do this and you win, ha ha!"  except in a much more deliciously urbane tone - I (and I don't think I'm completely alone here) latch on to the game-ness of the system.  I can't help it.  No matter how hard I try, I cannot let the game of a system alone.  In traditional RPGs, I'm used to a disjoint between building a character for interest and for effectiveness.  My abiding love for <cite>The Shadow of Yesterday</cite> comes from the fact that the one motive serves the other's purpose and vice versa - my most interesting TSoY characters are by the same virtue the most effective.<br><br>Now, a lot of indie games have something <em>like</em> that characteristic.  Their game is meant to encourage the desired play, or at least that's what I come to expect.  It's mostly true of <cite>Prime Time Adventures</cite> - except for the flaw that bit Josh.  You want fan mail to buy cards to swing events that you care about.  So you want to get fan mail, which means delighting your fellow players.  But even a colossal amount of fan mail won't guarantee anything - so you do your best to strategize, but you can get let down hard in the end.  And worse than a boardgame with an ultimately random component, an RPG encourages you to invest emotionally in the results of resolution. <br><br> So it can be hard, if you're of a strategic bent, to avoid wedding success to winning, which is an aesthetic thing, you know?  And it seems like Jesse's original idea here is that his preference is for the two to be independent.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            For me, Mike, I was disappointed in that my expended effort did not result in my expected outcome.  Call me crazy, but if I use a system to work towards a goal for 18 hours (4.5 episodes, 4 hours an episode), I kind of expect to get something out of it.  There was literally nothing else I could have done to game the system more than I did.  The system did not do what I expected it to do, and it did not do what I wanted it to do as a system.  Is it not designed for that?  Well, apparently!  That does not, however, negate my disappointment.<br><br/>Short Form:<br/>I thought PTA did one thing reliably.  Turns out it does some other thing.  And thus I was enlightened.                        </br></div>

                            And as another data point, in the Roach I do play to win -- but I really don't care if I lose.  The Roach is a little different than PTA, though, in that the stack of Reputation can be considered a continual diagnostic of how well you're doing (or more accurately, how well you are respected in the community), whereas Fan Mail is a resource to be spent, and thus having a pile of Fan Mail means that you were really awesome at some point, but not having a pile of Fan Mail doesn't mean that you weren't just awesome a moment ago.<br/><br/>What I'm getting at, though, is you can treat every transaction in the Roach with a goal of "I am going to play this situation well" and then do so, and you get this little running total of your success (clarification point: this is the <em>player's</em> success at manipulating the system).  In PTA, which does not have that tactical element, you can't really go into each scene thinking "I am going to game this to my advantage" and you don't have any metric to gauge that success even if you could.  So in Roach, I play to win, sure, but I play to win each transaction, and even if I lose, I can point at my stack and say, "Yeah, but look at how I did!"  In PTA, you get a much more amorphous "Yeah, but the series had this dramatic point that I was involved in but didn't actually intend."<br/><br/>At the end of the day, that's what rankles me.  The series went in a direction that I didn't intend, despite my best efforts to the contrary.  I felt like my contribution to the game was irrelevant.  And that sucks no matter what you're playing.                        </div>

                            At the end of that episode (which was my spotlight) I felt like my presence at the table did not have any appreciable impact in the development of the fiction.  My character could have been an NPC.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Presented with a system that asks to be treated like a game I (and I don't think I'm completely alone here) latch on to the game-ness of the system.</blockquote>You are so very much <b>not</b> alone.  In our (delicious and wonderful!) TSoY game, people were averaging between ten and fifteen <b>advances</b> every three hour session.  That's 50 - 75 experience points per session.  Each.<br/><br/>Why?  Because we figured that the system existed to be gamed, and so we all racked up five meaty Keys immediately and started pounding the living hell out of them ... even (especially!) when it was the stupidest possible thing for our characters to do.  Because that's who they were.<br/><br/>TSoY (as you rightly point out) rewards that sort of aggressive attack.<br/><br/>PTA (to my mind) rewards a different strategy:  When we played, I (and by cooperation the others) were often trying to actually <i>permanently remove</i> from the system as many of the original budget points as possible.  So we would max out our ability to give fan-mail and spend fan-mail, and insist that the producer be spending as much opposition as he was allowed, because we wanted the money to be moving as often as possible in the down-the-drain economic spiral.  That turned out to make pretty good games, in a way that (apparently) driving the fan-mail economy toward your personal benefit doesn't do.  I don't really have the PTA experience to say whether that's a real pattern or we're just an outlier.                        </div>
