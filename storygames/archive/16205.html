There were a wide variety of experiences that emerged from playing Vampire (from loving it so much as to play it weekly, to dismissing it with hatred). A lot of threads where people post their thoughts on Vampire tend to go loopy pretty quickly, usually due to people with conflicting experiences telling each other what they should feel about the Game They Like/Hate. So I wanted to have a Share Your Thoughts thread.<br/><br/>So here's the rules. If you don't read them, your post probably won't be deleted. But I think it'd help to just get them out there and hope people agree to follow them for the sake of seeing what the world is like for other people.<br/><br/>RULE ZERO: You MUST have played Vampire, preferably more than once. If you are posting here because you read it thoroughly but have not played it--you're not doing the thing the thread is here to do.<br/><br/>RULE ONE: You only get one post. Just one. Your thoughts. You can go back and revise it, adding more or citing others, but no more than one single post. If you have a "Oh, that post there reminds me..." thought, revise your original post or create a new one.<br/>Whispers don't count, you can whisper others as much as you want.<br/><br/>RULE TWO: Addendum to Rule One, indicating the point of this thread: You're sharing your experiences, experiences which for the purpose of this thread are inviolate: No one can judge you on them in this thread, even if you're wrong (here I'm thinking of folks saying "I don't like 4e because there's no wandering monsters", then JD or someone pointing them to the page which explains wandering monsters). If you want to correct people, to tell them that they weren't doing it right or that Rule X Clearly Exists or whatever, please create another thread and do so, not here.<br/><br/>Ready?

Storytellers being dominant the wrong way, players showing little commitment, interaction limping along, and in each and every session I played the interaction was halted by "inspiring" readings of "flavor text" (different storytellers, actually, one of them a good orator, but still ...). <br/><br/>After my third session I gave it up, laughing at the pomposity and silliness of it all.<br/><br/>I would have liked these sessions to work; I really like the vampire-figure. But it did not work, not on any sensible level of play. Sigh!<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b><br/>BTW: in one session (on a convention) me and two other players tried to salvage the game, by putting every effort into our participation, asking questions to the storyteller, taking initiatives, etc ...<br/>- but there were two bleak goth-girls at the same table, totally clueless to playing their characters. And they nullified our efforts. The storyteller was far too focused on them to really care about the efforts we made. And when the girls did not return to the table, after a short break, he was thoroughly  disappointed. The game was a bit better from then on, but he never really rallied from his social defeat. It ended as a lame storytelling, where the players left at the table were railroaded into a swift character-doom. <br/><br/>I actually felt a bit sorry for the guy; trying to impress two girls so totally clueless about life and fun, failing, and losing his spirits so totally.

I was utterly obsessed with Vampire LARPing for a long time, in a <i>somewhat</i> good way, although it did spill over into my life a bit. It was the first time I realised how obsessive RPGs could be.<br/><br/>When I was in San Francisco, many of my best friends played Vampire. We'd play for three hours, on a Friday night, then retreat to the Holding Company, a nearby bar. I have fond memories of that time. They were good people.

You could spend hours, with plans going on in your head, doing <i>not much</i>.

I still recall most rules were confusing but we didn't use them all. Some Disciplines were more broken than others but I preferred the ones that made you think to find another use for them except the obvious. Our narrator was this cool actor student that did a wonderful work portraying the NPCs, and wasn't afraid to go fun and bizarre with the setting, because us players never really went with the somber atmosphere of the game.<br/><br/>I played a Malkavian. The very concept of an insane clan of vampires made me fall in love with the setting. The fact that such clan was feared not because of their powers but for the fact that they were nuts gave me the guide to embrace roleplaying and had fun with it, remaining in character as much as I could. My PC followed orders and accomplished the mission, however he never did it in the usual fashion. <i>Malkavian just don't think in straight lines from A to B, they think in curves.</i><br/><br/>It's the only RPG I would like to go back to every time, despite the rules and broken stuff. Mysteriously, is also the only one I haven't hacked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts" title="DorkThoughts"><img alt="DorkThoughts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts">DorkThoughts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369484/#Comment_369484" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T15:51:21+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  3:51PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played Vampire the Requiem for about a year<br/><br/>The GM ran it very well as a sandbox, so I think the primary thing I got from it was a sense of freedom. Private downtime actions were expected of us (and we were at a pretty large disadvantage if we didn't take those actions, since other players/NPCs would be doing things). It was set in San Francisco, so we utilized a lot of cool local flavor and google maps and what not.<br/><br/>I think, originally, the GM wanted us to explore themes of humanity more. So, we would be embraced and then deal with our former lives. However, in play (largely as the result of huge shifts in the cities power dynamics) these things fell by the wayside and the game took a definite turn for the political (which I found to be great fun). <br/><br/>The system I was pretty turned off by. The morality/virtue/vice system was cool in flavor but turned out wonky for us in play. Some players really embraced that fully (to the point of power gaming) while for others it was an impediment towards playing the sort of character they wanted to play. I also hated the dice pools (mostly cause I had abysmally bad luck...I'm not sure if the critical failure rules are RAW, but those screwed me so many times). Conversely, I once rolled lucky enough to kill the Sheriff of SF by running her over repeatedly with a bulldozer. Ugh, and auto-fire rules...GAH!<br/><br/>That said, the emphasis on politics and organizations was very cool. City of Damnation was an awesome supplement that I refer to for most urban settings. I would play in the setting again, but would rather use a different system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369492/#Comment_369492" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T16:09:50+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  4:09PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought Rein-Hagen revolutionized and re-invented RP.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe OWOD rules with challenge rating using dice-pools with botches and specialties for exploding dice was an awesome and exciting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe setting with the other rule books Werewolf Apocalypse; Mage Ascension etc were okay, but since I was not a big fan of the additional rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough, Vampire the Masquerade / Storyteller's Screen (1996) is in my opinion the single best source-book or rules system ever printed for the mass market.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost players I interacted with preferred the millions of clan-books and alternate rules such as Changeling.

It took White Wolf a long, long time to get the system right -- the earlier the version of Storyteller, the more screwed-up and borderline terrible it gets.  Which actually might have been a plus when I first started playing it, since we were all callow youths who had played mostly AD&amp;D; running face-first into the terrible combat system of VtM2e meant that we learned to avoid combat like it was the plague, and that in turn brought us directly into the very best parts of the game.  (The very latest iteration of Storyteller is actually a great system, much improved from its predecessors, but part of me wonders if it would have done as good a job of breaking those bad habits.)<br/><br/>Political games were always my favorite; taking a bunch of characters and coming up with a common goal, then pursuing that goal with every bit of guile, trickery, and political savvy at our disposal despite the best efforts of our rivals and even the basic underpinnings of vampire society to stop us.  Call of Cthulhu taught me to play characters rather than tactical avatars; Vampire taught me to play socially-focused characters who wanted things and pursued their own goals and maintained relationships with NPCs.<br/><br/>Plus, it's a tremendously fun game.  Flexible enough to run all kinds of different types of vampire games and with lots of cool vampire powers to mess around with.  I must've played over a dozen campaigns with it, and I think only three were similar to each other.  That's great value for an RPG, right there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369529/#Comment_369529" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T18:12:28+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  6:12PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played a few games.

I *loved* Vampire (I mostly played 2e).  It was my first non-D&amp;D game as a player outside of one-shots (I'd GMed Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0. at the insistence of a born-again gf's parents - a story in itself - and Twilight:2000 - that ended when the combat engineer fumbled an armed block of C4 into the vehicle carrying the rest of the explosives) and it was eye-opening.  We'd always played (A)D&amp;D with a bunch of freeform role-playing (like probably almost everyone) but the games we had were still very much focused on "let's go explore a dungeon/wilderness and get treasure and maybe banter along the way."  Even Twilight:2000 and Cyberpunk were very mission-based, and so it was a revelation to play a game where a) *story* was explicitly front-and-center and b) the PCs were often focused on totally non-fighty things and c) were often pretty morally dark.  I played a Toreador playwright in my first game and we listened to Dead Can Dance and I spent the whole night after the first game awake on an adrenaline rush trying to figure out how to get back at my friend's Setite.<br/><br/>In HS, we always played games run by my friend N.  They were always fun up until the almost-end - he was fond of having plotlines that revolved around deprotagonizingly powerful elders manipulating things from the shadows, so the final reveal was almost always us watching (though my Toreador did get to go out in a blaze of glory against a massively overpowered Sabbat who had Embraced his mortal lover).   But N's games dripped with atmosphere, so just hanging out in them and doing stuff - being thrown to our own devices to make plans was new! - was plenty fun.  We had lots of downtime as two of us would leave the room so that the third  player could do secret stuff with N, but that was fun hanging out time and heightened the immersion and paranoia of not knowing what the other PCs were up to - N's games were also almost always very PC-adversarial until some 4th generation Nosferatu or whatever showed up and iced us all.<br/><br/>In uni, I played the *heck* out of Vampire.  I was in one four-year campaign run by a good friend, M, who I've since lost touch with (and really regret that!).  Her game was much more "fanged superheroes," but was fun in its own way, full of gonzo occult touches, and lots of local color from her home city of Toronto (uni was also the first time I was living in a city - Montreal - rather than the sticks or a suburb, so the city itself was romantic to me).  My Gangrel spent a few sessions magically locked into bat form.  My Setite was being hunted by Joan of Arc.  For a little while I got to play a Ventrue who led an army through downtown Toronto to fight a dragon, and at the tail end of the campaign (after an incident with time travel retconned the Ventrue so that he never went to torpor and was way too powerful to be a PC), I had a Mummy that the Malkavian bound into an envelope and mailed to Bolivia.  We had a great fight between the two Toreador where the rest of us all went to get snacks because they couldn't hurt each other.  Everyone tried to hit on M's roommate G, who was way too cool for us, except for T who hit on one of the player's roommates (who was way too straight for him).  We used to make these elaborate communal dinners and play for six to seven hours on Friday nights.<br/><br/>There were also a bunch of shorter-lived campaigns.  I GMed a summer game where everyone played themselves, which took a dark turn when the Setite who Embraced this really nice guy in our group gruesomely murdered all his housemates, and a mournful one when one guy ended up playing his friend who came to find out what happened to him after he (the player's PC version of himself) got murdered.  We played a really moody Dark Ages game that died due to scheduling conflicts just when it was getting good - my Tzimisce was pushing back against the Toreador PC horning in on his domain with Catholic allies by fleshcrafting entire congregations to the crucifixes in their churches.  I ran a Sabbat game set in the same continuity as M's Toronto game, and we got to have two groups of PCs fight each other during a failed siege (plus the Ravnos antitribu went to Hades). I'm sure there were others that ran 2-4 sessions that I'm blanking on right now.<br/><br/>I did some LARPing in uni, too, but it never took.  In canon, Montreal was a Sabbat city, but many of the players took "Sabbat" to be synonymous with "asshole" (and, OH, did we argue about Montreal By Night).  A lot of the LARP folks didn't respect the "out of character" conventions, which was a pain in the ass (e.g., we had these pendants made that were supposed to indicate you were in character when you had it on and if not, not, but you'd be out just trying to have a drink and rock out to Bauhaus and someone would come up and be all, like, "hey, this is the territory of the Red Right Hand, and I'm Pack Priest, so let's fight.").  Plus there was a lot of "one of the GMs girlfriends is a Tremere antitribu, so all the Tremere have six replaceable clones and if you kill one you killed a clone" (I shit you not).<br/><br/>In grad school, I got L and N back together for an online game that started in the 1750s, but we only made it to the Revolutionary War before that fizzled... we'd largely just grown apart.  The end of that game was pretty much an end to my RPing in general for a few years.  Vampire was far from a perfect system, but it was a game where I could come to the table knowing that other players would be down with a game that was about politics, or existential crises, or just being dark and brooding.  Most of the people I met for a while only played D&amp;D, and wanted beer and pretzels games.  And then I didn't meet much of anyone, and sort of wasn't interested in trying.  Much later, I tried a Sabbat game set during the fall of Baghdad in 2003, which I still think was kind of a chill concept, but scheduling issues killed it, and i haven't played since.  Though I did read the 20th Anniversary Ed., which made me really want to play again.<br/><br/>Indirectly, it also led me back to gaming, in a way.  I got back in via Kirt Dankmyer's Werewolf game (that only lasted one session), and that led me to his much-underappreciated game Unsung, and thence to the Forge and to other indie games.  I still haven't found a game that quite captures the feeling of playing Vampire and being non-ironically immersed in a feeling that Joy Division was DEEP and MEANINGFUL, but that's probably because the feeling is at least 35% nostalgia by weight at this point.  If someone I knew and trusted was running anything where I could play a Tzimisce, I would seriously rearrange my life around it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369545/#Comment_369545" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T19:01:46+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  7:01PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I came to Vampire through Werewolf.

The GM was full on board with the traditional plot railroad scheme. Despite being somewhat familiar with the setting, I didn't get viscerally why my character would and should care about some mission from the Prince of the city. I played along, though, instead of being an ass about it. Unfortunately the mission itself was not interesting, and the most logical way of engaging with it (that is, not going into the dangerous building where the bad guys were, but rather observing from afar) sidelined me for the rest of the session as the other players went in, lost a fight and got saved/kidnapped by some mages in a pick-up van. I don't think the campaign lasted beyond that session, and I at least had no motivation to play more. I didn't think that Vampire had as much to do with the experience as the GM, who wasn't exactly on-board with the freshest of fresh GMing techniques.<br/><br/>The above experience didn't really change my impression of Vampire as an interesting setting with barely a game enmeshed in it. At least I know now that if I'm going to run it myself, I'll make sure to get player buy-in for the setting and situation with some preliminary scenes and discussion and such; the players need to understand and appreciate the undead state of their characters, and they need to understand and appreciate the social rules of the undead world. It just won't work emotionally if a player thinks that the whole "we've got our own secret society within human society and it's all feudal" thing is pointless and funny and not something their character would care about.<br/><br/>I've also leafed through the Vampire rulebook once - not read it in detail, but enough to get a sense for its style. After WW and other companies have totally run the pompous style of writing interleaved with pointless fluff text to the ground, it's funny to read the original Vampire and note that yes, it's exactly like that as well. Rather adorable, in fact. I could totally get with it if I didn't have anything better to do, either swapping in a more interesting system of play or going by the book with delicious irony and explicit player cooperation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369616/#Comment_369616" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T06:22:37+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  6:22AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2012 6:25AM by jenskot.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played several enjoyable Vampire LARPs.<br/><br/>I didn't know much about gaming back then. Didn't read any rule books. Didn't know most of the rules. Didn't know the world or history. Which made it all feel more exciting. I had no preconceptions, I just jumped into the middle of the ocean and decided I would figure out if I can swim later.<br/><br/>I met several attractive women playing, and some games I spent more time socializing than playing.<br/><br/>When I was in a steady relationship, I wanted to play more but it felt like players who read all the books had distinct advantages. It sometimes felt like I had to read tomes of history just to have a chance to make an impact. But I didn't have that time to invest so I grew more and more disinterested as they work to fun ratio seemed to drift apart.<br/><br/>I played a few mega World of Darkness LARPs that included Vampires, Werewolves, Mages, Fae and more. These felt like superhero games and an arms race towards very non-subtle, non-emo, non-political drama. Which I enjoy in other games but not why I play Vampire. But it was still fun.<br/><br/>I was sometimes both worried and impressed how I couldn't tell when someone was or wasn't in character. I never dressed up or played to be immersed (later I would play Call of Cthulhu this way). And I was a bit uncomfortable how the game had internal social status hierarchies that bled over to the real world. Having an in game high status character treated with high status outside of the game was strange but people loved it and fought for it. I never got into the Vampire games that you play in the real world, among people not playing the game. <br/><br/>The most frustrating part of Vampire was the chaos, not knowing what's going on, not being in the right place at the right time to witness the best parts. But strangely connected was one of my favorite parts, hanging out afterwards, exchanging stories and sharing what we all missed.<br/><br/>My favorite part of Vampire is it introduced many awesome people to tabletop RPGs! Many of my favorite RPG players are former Vampire players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369622/#Comment_369622" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T07:03:36+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  7:03AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2012 7:57AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            White Wolf was a really big part of my college group's mindshare, but we played a surprisingly small amount compared to how much we always talked about it and pored over the books like Talmud scholars.  The WoD books weren't my first RPG, but they're definitely the ones I still have nostalgia for.<br/><br/>When we did play VtM, we were not at all interested in the political aspect, fetching and carrying for the Prince and the Archons and all that... in hindsight I think my take was very influenced by the 1st edition core, which was more about vampires and their individual angsts and downplayed how much the characters were supposed to know about and be involved in greater vampiric society, because, y'know, that stuff hadn't been written yet.  In fact, to this day I have not actually read the 2nd edition corebook, despite reading pretty much every single one of its supplements.  <br/><br/>Our games were a mix of personal horror (dealing with the Beast, abandoning or maintaining your daylight life, etc) and pulpy occult horror chasing down Noddist apocrypha and apocalyptic prophecies or running afoul of some crazy cult or bloodline or other mythic boojum a la X-Files. One of my group recently mentioned that reading Hellboy for the first time gave him crazy deja vu, because that was basically how we played Vampire.  I don't think that really qualifies as "superheroes with fangs" any more than Unknown Armies does, but we definitely enjoyed reveling in Disciplines and all that.<br/><br/>We had like all the splatbooks and adventures, but we were well aware that while they were tremendous fun to read, there was stuff there that was completely game-wrecking, either for mechanical reasons (I still remember that Daughters of Cacophony Discipline that let you basically deal agg damage to anyone in the world, at any time)or because it was an insane unfun railroad (pretty much every adventure) so we just used it for inspiration.  Whenever I ran VtM I didn't even allow anyone to play non-Camarilla clans/bloodlines until Revised hit and it was all cleaned up and in the corebook.<br/><br/>I haven't played Requiem, but I have read it.  It seems tied with Werewolf tF for "least fundamentally changed from oWoD", though I do like the look of some of the stuff like Blood Potency instead of Generation.  I might try it sometime, but I just had an extremely unsatisfying experience with Changeling tL I blame directly on the book and system, so it's not gonna be any time soon.<br/><br/>I have not read V20, partially out of a sense of "can't go home again" and partially not wanting to pay like $100 for a game I essentially already own a couple times over.  I am also completely appalled that they went back to "target number and number of successes are now independent variables" after finally fixing that nonsense in Revised.<br/><br/>Oh, and I loved Kindred of the East.  It was batshit gonzo and poorly researched in places and occasionally kind of racist, but I thought it was kind of an amazing synthesis of like three of the five core WoD games and I'm sorry we didn't get to play more of it.  I actually think it's become a little more culturally relevant with the rise of completely bonkers gore flicks out of Japan like Helldriver and Tokyo Gore Police.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369626/#Comment_369626" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T07:12:27+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  7:12AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2012 7:12AM by thadrine.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vampire was actually my first game. I was immediately in love with the Gothic horror in the books and the tone of it all, and I read it all. No one I met could run it for crap. For years I met one burn out after the next that would never actually get a game off the ground. Eventually I said screw it and left gaming for a while. I then came back and ran DnD for a few years, but eventually came back to Vampire by starting my own group. We had all kinds of problems with the system, and some goofy parts of the setting, but we made it work. To this day I would still consider that the best games I ever played were with Vampire. Looking back at it I know it was not so much because of the system, but that the players all really got into what was going on and made it rock. <br/><br/>I also went to a larp at the Warehouse in Cincinnati (for those of you that are familiar) once, that was a horrible experience. Me and the people that went could not even begin to separate the in-game drama from the out-of-game drama. And when I saw a man in assless chaps I was out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T" title="Frank T"><img alt="Frank T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T">Frank T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369627/#Comment_369627" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T07:14:00+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  7:14AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bought the Vampire 1E softcover in early 1992 at my FLGS. At the time, I was mainly running WEG\u2019s d6-System, customized to my setting of choice. The adventures were scripted missions, what wasn\u2019t action was mainly railroading but the player were allowed to request stuff in between sessions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe classy visual appearance of Vampire, the flamboyant flavor texts, band quotes etc. appealed to me as they probably only can appeal to a 15-year-old. \u201cAnd if you gaze into an abyss for too long, the abyss gazes also into you.\u201d Well, you know the drill. I had the book with me on a holiday trip and devoured it. At the same time I was reading the original Dracula by Bram Stoker. I wrote my first character\u2019s diary on a student note pad. It was a Ventrue by the name of Angus McLeod. What do you want? I was 15!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat fascinated me about Vampire weren\u2019t the rules. Sure, free combination of any skill with any attribute was neat, and the d10 pool seemed easier to handle than Shadowrun\u2019s \u201cexploding d6\u201d pools. There wasn\u2019t a mass of crunch yet, not in the 1E core book. I liked the rules from reading them, but that wasn\u2019t it. Neither was it the setting, although I really found that Anne Rice number uber-cool. No, what really fascinated me was the role-playing philosophy of the author, Mark Rein-Hagen, which, to me, was most succinctly conveyed in the original 1E texts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat guy had a vision, a vision of <i>deep</i> fictional content, a vision of collaborative storytelling! Characters in Vampire had a past, a Prelude that was actually played out, even, and Backgrounds. They had Nature and Demeanor, Virtues and Humanity, in short: a personality! They were deeply torn within, it was in their nature. And that was what the game was about. It was bleeding from the text. Sure, they also had nine Attributes, kewl powerz and other stuff, also covered by the rules. You could look up how many lbs. you could bench-press at Strength 2. But who cared? I for one didn\u2019t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1995, I was playing with some new players who were much stronger in terms of character portrayals than my previous group members. I told one of them about Vampire, we talked for two hours and really got excited. We found other players who would play with us. I started a campaign set in 1900 Germany. One of them played a Scotch Ventrue, by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI met with each of them 1 on 1 and played their Preludes. I worked with distinctive NPCs a lot. We played by candle light. At one point we skipped a couple of years in game and I asked the players to write me a bit on what their characters had been up to, which they did with verve, and I took much inspiration from that. In the beginning, I had been running scripted adventures out of habit, but more and more, I shifted to working with what the players gave me, and what the characters\u2019 actions warranted.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt some point one of the players offered to run a Dark Ages Vampire campaign, as he had bought the book and was really digging it. That guy was less dominant as GM than I had been, and the other players knew the rules and the setting better and became even more pro-active. It was the best role-playing we had ever had, to that day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the time, we players were also best friends, we were in our last year of high school, hanging out at our favorite pub every other day, partying on the week-ends, sharing joy and sorrow. At times our role-playing sessions would drift into talk about women, sex and the meaning of life (and boy were we feeling grown-up sipping our single malt whisky). On other days it was intense role-playing all the way, immersive even. We played every Sunday, sometimes until dawn. We were having the time of our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also played in a brief but very intense Vampire Sabbat game with the same players but another GM. That, too, was fantastic role-playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy that time we were playing 2E but not much rules-lawyering ensued and there was a fair amount of hand-waving. Still, when push came to shove, the rules as written would be what resolved the dispute. We used the rules from the core book (and Sabbat books in case of the Sabbat game). No player\u2019s guide or other splat books. I did get the Brujah Clanbook for my birthday but we never applied anything from that to the game. We did use the clans and sects and their history and philosophies to inspire our campaigns, for we found them very inspiring indeed. And in the Dark Ages game, the GM made extensive use of the Constantinople source book, the back story, places and NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played in these games until they dissolved in what must have been 1999 or 2000. To me, Vampire opened up a whole new dimension of character portrayal and, well, Story in role-playing. My Vampire characters had a depth and complexity unheard of in previous games. Later I tried to do that in other games, too, but not all were suited to it. Vampire was heavy with meaning, it was theatrical, at times pathetic. Of course, going \u201cman, I\u2019m badass\u201d was part of it, when your character had pulled some badass stunt. Rules mastery factored into that insofar as it was required to actually pull said badass stunt off. And more so, player cleverness factored into it as political scheming got more and more important and positioning became a main gauge of effectiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at the heart of the game there were the personal relationships, between the PCs and also with some NPCs. Suddenly there was room in role-playing for love, loyalty, friendship, mistrust, treason, doubt, remorse and other such emotions, not just as a little thing on the side, but as <i>central part</i>, as the pivotal point of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might argue that all of this was accomplished by us, the players, and not Vampire, the game. But without the writings of Mark Rein-Hagen in the Vampire books, without such elements as Nature and Demeanor, Willpower and Frenzy, Humanity (or Roads in Dark Ages), without the setting with its clans, sects and traditions, the \u201chow you create progeny\u201d, Blood Bond, Golconda, etc., without all that we would not have accomplished it. Not with such intensity and focus. And personally I believe we weren\u2019t the only ones, at the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369669/#Comment_369669" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T09:41:26+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  9:41AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2012 2:27PM by Nathan_H.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I loved Vampire!

It was the first game I was excited to GM. Vampire allowed me to run a sandbox game and showed the importance of relationship maps. I was even able to keep our vampire games focused because we kept everything tied into relationship maps.  They players enjoyed this because they could see how their action affected the relationship map, and the world. <br><br>We never really investigated the themes of humanity, but with the release of sabbat, we did get to explore alternate morality.   I liked that vampire encouraged us to play something other then supers or heroes, something darker with teeth.  Yes some depth of character not just a bad-ass, with real flaws that can trigger a mechanical effect like frenzy. <br><br>It was the game that taught me how not to over plot and play to see what happens.  I did not realize this until I got back to gaming in my 30s looking for that experience, and found indie games.  The most plotting I do these days is a situation setup done similar to FLFS suggestions, and currently I'm loving the fronts from AW.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369683/#Comment_369683" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T10:32:24+00:00" title="March 28, 2012 10:32AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GM'd it once (Ashes to Ashes, I think), and played it / WoD a few times.

As a GM, I accidentally failed to implement a Grand Plot style of storytelling and ended up instead with a chronicle drawn from reacting to all the emotional flags the players had planted with their characters, wrapping the emergent story around them.  Really great experience, but done entirely without understanding what I was doing.  Until, like, right now as I write this.  In this particular chronicle's prelude for the Nosferatu-with-True-Faith character (this was a sequel to a game I'd run earlier), I tossed out a throwaway line about Nosferatu computer sim projections that put Gehenna as happening within the next five years--and the player shifted his entire raison d'etre to preparing for Gehenna.  Turned out to have lasting and very cool story consequences.  I fucked hard with the characters along the way, and they were great about it.<br><br>As a player, I ended up running a Caitiff with the Dark Fate flaw, the write up for which expressly says, "This may seem like you're screwed, but those of us who have played it tend to find it liberating."  It sure was for me.  Freed from any notion of a happy ending, I played my character as the most balls-out, doomed sonuvabitch ever.  Totally unexpected, but every time the GM tried to offer a "woo-oo-ooo, you're so damned with your Dark Fate" plot twist, I came up with something that damned me even more.  Basically, I rode the declining humanity train with a vengeance.  To his credit, the GM rode it out and went with the flow, even though I clearly surprised or even shocked him on a few occasions.  This was the game in which I blood-bound the entire party at one point, prompting a rash of suicides with this fact came out.<br><br>I had a particularly powerful experience in this game with the Caitiff.  Went out to hunt one night and encountered a young couple in a park.  I was pretty brutal in dominating them and got ready to drain one or both dry, but..couldn't.  I mean, *I* couldn't.  It was a genuine Conscience moment.  I totally locked up and couldn't bring myself to have my character commit cold-blooded murder.  I ended up having him flee the scene and leave the confused would-be victims in a muddled trance state.  That particular moment left an impression.<br><br>So I had some good times with it, even though I'm not generally a vampire story fan.  I haven't been grabbed by Requiem, but really, really want to run a Dark Ages game.  The atmospheric bits of Vampire can be so great for establishing mood.  As a political, intrigue-oriented game, though, I found Werewolf much stronger and more engaging.  Vampire seemed to emphasize Discipline capabilities more than anything, and I found players tended to talk more about what powers they wanted to buy than how they wanted to develop relationships or worldly influence.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Corey%20Metcalfe" title="Corey Metcalfe"><img alt="Corey Metcalfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/805/nIZIL1SPPMYQ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Corey%20Metcalfe">Corey Metcalfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370454/#Comment_370454" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-01T12:30:30+00:00" title="April  1, 2012 12:30PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played the PnP, and I still Larp it every Saturday night (though not entirely by choice). Having spent a lot of time reading the setting material, the novels, and the rules, I feel I can conclusively say that V:tM is a very cool setting for 90's Young Adult fiction; it is a miserable setting to RP in. The biggest problem I found (as a Larper, at least) is that the stories of the canon do not, in any meaningful way, reflect sane or realistic political action. The stories presented all have these unshakably badass characters who are, at times, almost flawless - players who want to embody these characters (or characters like them) are sorely disappointed when they fail.<br>\n<br>\nThe core driving theme of the Camarilla - that Elders control everything and oppress the younger vampires - is a neat theme to read about, but not to experience. In a Larp it creates this crazy struggle between either giving Elder characters more power so that the setting can be upheld or making them the same power level and abandoning that entire part of the game. I can see why the Dogma 99 forbids turning a PnP into a Larp.<br>\n<br>\nAnd don't even get me started on the Essentialist and Racist structures in V:tM.

It was the first game I encountered that blew open what a game could be.  Even though I played Toon, Paranoia, and Ghostbusters, I think I dismissed those mostly because they were comedic games. Of coure they could break the rules because they were about being silly.<br><br>But here was a <i>serious</i> game!<br><br>I quickly snapped up the rest, and they became my primary games for the better part of a decade. I snapped up the rest of the WoD games and collected a ton of books for most of them.<br><br>One of the largest campaigns I played in was a Vampire campaign. A story of elder vampires in near future Paris as the end of the world approaches. It was a lot of fun, thanks mostly to a great Storyteller and fellow players.<br><br>But then Vampire grew stale (especially in comparison to a few other WoD games, which would vie for my favorite game). Exalted ultimately broke me away from it because it would illustrate how broken the core system was. After that, I couldn't run Vampire anymore, and playing it was only done if I knew the GM was high quality (which usually meant breaking the rules in a way I liked).<br><br>The main problems are disconnect between text and rules. The text talks about story and personal struggle, but many of the rules focus on combat abilities and cool powers. Although the system promised a universal conflict ("Uh, that's a Strength + Computers roll.") combat got a special treatment, with both more complex rules than other conflict, and the only measured injury chart making it not always an all or nothing affair. For other conflict types, there was a lack of guidance, even though they had examples and expected these rolls to happen. What does winning a seduction roll mean? How far does that go? What about spreading rumors? Too much left up to the storyteller.<br><br>Another problem was the system itself. There was no guidance on how to make opponents properly balanced against characters. There was talk about building NPCs, based on either experience points or character points - building a non "level 1" character to match the characters. But you can easily, without trying, make an NPC that is too focused in certain areas, making them much more effective than they should be. On top of that, the range of a die roll is wide, and a lucky roll can kill a character. Since combat is the most complex conflict, it's the most appealing to use, so this is a real problem even if the game is intended to not be combat oriented by all those involved.<br><br>Requiem came out and rekindled my interest. They removed the cartoon that passed for a engaging world wide conspiracy, and gave a toolkit that could be used to create your own political structure, ranging from the book standard city-wide politics with vampire history past a couple hundred years hazy at best, to globe spanning political machinations that have calcified over centuries with a known (popular) history stretching back to the beginning. The criticisms because it got rid of the Camarilla and Sabbat in familiar forms baffled me, since any Storyteller could recreate that easily by selecting two covenants and setting them up as having been at war for a long time, and incorporate anything else they enjoyed about Masquerade.<br><br>But it wasn't enough. The system was largely unchanged. The politics of the vampires and potential stories, while greatly expanded, weren't enough to overcome the outdated system.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371226/#Comment_371226" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T13:44:49+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  1:44PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vampire was great, right up until I played it with people outside my existing group.

It marked a transition from one way of seeing RPGs to another. It had some thematics resonating with adolescent concerns: self-alienation, oedipal power conflict and the price of finding one's place in a social body... as such it hit me at the perfect time, and I think helped me tremendously.<br/><br/>It was pretentious, and in the end failed to deliver, but still because it aimed so high, I feel it contributed in an uplifting the whole medium.<br/><br/>I wrote the following for the V20 edition, when WW asked for fan contributions. I guess it wasn't good enough. Still, apart from a couple of points, it's perfect to sum up how I feel about Vampire (up to the probable histori(ographi)cal errors); so after pondering using it for the past month (fearing of being rude mostly), I'll just go with it. One thing I found out since I redacted it, and the image will make no sense to English players if I don't mention it: all the opening chapter quotes in the English first edition were relegated into the margins in the French edition.<br/><br/>Anyway:<br/><br/>It feels like it cannot be, like their must be a mistake, or a joke in the Malkavian time, surely it cannot have been that long, but here it is, the naked alabaster truth - with menacing teeth: Vampire has been an integral part of our lives for more than twenty years now. Uchronia-building daemon, collective escapist celebration,  metaphor engine for inner conflicts confrontation*, proper great game... it's been all that and more. First lesson it taught me, though, as a would-be game-designer, can be summed up thus:<br/><br/>Character sheets are magic.<br/><br/>Filled, they are love letters, I've been told. Blank, they're a cosmogonic statement of purpose, I would add.<br/>The old Vampire sheet with its layout, its three columns, was sending a powerful and clear (typo)graphical message:<br/><br/>Physical. Social. Mental.<br/><br/>All three equally important, equally represented, would be equally meaningful in shaping the experience it promised; a promise which captured the heart of a whole generation of players, the one that had been pondering the specificity of the *role* aspect of role playing games and was still struggling to extirpate it from its original war-gaming gangue. The one that was asking "Why should I gain experience for killing things ?", and was soon to ask: "Why should I gain experience ?".<br/>While the games which preceded it offered to play picaresque pulp heroes - anomics and outcasts in quest for power and riches, Vampire would offer to play one of the twisted and monstrous member of the great aristocracy of the night, in their struggle for domination - not to mention the pointless and deadly quarrels that arise from being forced to live together. It had epic over-the-top sword fights in dark alleys. It introduced relationship maps as a campaign management tool to the general audience. It presented statistics reflecting a character's inner life, turmoil, and changes.<br/>It wanted to do <i>everything</i>.<br/> <br/><br/>Talents. Skills. Knowledge.<br/><br/>And it was simple to grasp too. Short, to the point, everything fitted on one page, the dots a clear visual hint of your character\u2019s strengths and weaknesses; before you even knew how to play, you knew whether your character was good at something or not - and you knew (or thought you knew) what the best at something could aspire to; before you had even browsed the book, you knew the game would be about bureaucracy and survival, music and occultism, etiquette and vigilance, and you knew those things were as - if not more - important in defining your character and its adventures as dexterity, or intelligence, or beauty.<br/>This may seem common sense, not even worth mentioning nowadays, but I have my old battered AD&amp;D 2nd edition book, published barely a couple of years before, on my knees as I write, and what a difference. The hypertrophy of attributes, the escalation of numbers, the cornucopia  of lists and tables - the game didn't even come with a pre-made character sheet.<br/>Both games were of the same species, undeniably, but you could see the birth of a new genus in the making.<br/><br/>Disciplines. Backgrounds. Virtues.<br/><br/>Nowhere was this more apparent than in the way it handled powers and social ties. There the old lists came back, catalog of wonders to be browsed at leisure, with promises of marvelous feats and fears to come, justifying the existence of other pages. But, in the case of backgrounds, they came with a tentative attempt at abstraction that would haunt the game, felt present in its many lists of adjectives, a desire to describe qualities qualitatively - without succumbing to the great numerical quantitative frenzy, and who would remain in gestation, dormant, enforced in one way or another by all players I've know**, to be explored fully by another generation of games.<br/>Virtues were the forever odd element, and might as well have been a pious wish - in my experience, too many players sadly ignored them - if not for the fact that they defined the experience of what Vampire attempted to be, branding it indelibly on the margins of the sheet***. Vampire wanted to be a game about the sudden loss of control, about courage and its failings, and the pangs of conscience. It wanted to be a game about failures even more than it wanted to be a game about accomplishments.<br/> <br/> <br/>Humanity.<br/>Willpower.<br/><br/>With the distance, it's easy to say that Vampire failed to be the game of personal horror its creators wanted it to be. Unable to free itself completely from the soil it arose from, it would meander for three editions, becoming a weird hybrid unable to fully manifest any of the qualities it bore. Which in my opinion, to this day, remains its foremost strength. Vampire was - is - the neutral ground of role-playing games. It gathers around the same table the Dudes of Legends and the Super Heroes of the Night, the Soap Opera Lovers and Back-Stabbing Intrigants, the Seekers of Horror and the Armchair Method Actors, makes them willing to share the same tales, and satisfies them all - if imperfectly.<br/>One might say the game was blessed with success from its failure.<br/><br/>Blood.<br/><br/>And so here we are, twenty years after, still trying to digest the lessons of a game that made us as much as we made it, reminiscing in half-bitter nostalgic celebration, browsing character sheets with margins filled to the brim with life and dead figments of our imagination, eagerly waiting for the long undead, now Elder, game to wake up from its agitated torpor. And all in all, I think many of us  are grateful to have been - to be - a part of it, in all its glorious silliness.<br/>I know I am.<br/><br/>*: Please bear with me. As the saying goes, we get seduced by their music first, then comes meaning.<br/>**: The rules might have stated that resources five meant you had five million dollars available in assets, but we all instinctively knew they were wrong. Having resource five meant you were insanely mother-fucking rich. That's what they meant.<br/>***:and if the book that preceded said sheet had taught its readers one thing, it's that the margins were the place for those bits that set the mood and give heart to the main body of text                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379124/#Comment_379124" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-21T09:35:41+00:00" title="May 21, 2012  9:35AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played some <i>Vampire</i> as a teenager in the late '90s. It (and the other WoD games) were gateways to <i>Mage</i>, which I played more of. In retrospect I think I felt there was something missing from Vampire as we played it, but that didn't consciously occur to me at the time and we all had fun anyway. What we played was a game of anguished super-anti-heroes caught up in evil conspiracies. The game does that pretty well. I'm not sure that's what it was supposed to do, but that's what it seemed to us at the time to be best for. We didn't play the super-evil torture stuff, nor did we play the haughty \xfcbergoth night club stuff.<br/><br/>Now I think I have a grasp on what it SHOULD have been, and maybe could have been if we'd known what we were doing. Vampire is a game about normal, flawed people being put in impossible double binds. The absolute strictest core, the double bind that rules them all, is the ever-lurking possibility of Frenzy. Vampires can only feed by victimizing others, in a deliberate, systematic way. If they don't do this, they get hungry, and run the risk of succumbing to Frenzy. During Frenzy, they sate their hunger however they can, instinctively, no matter who is hurt or killed in the process. So the vampire has to decide whether to deliberately, systematically stalk and hurt (but hopefully not kill) someone, or go hungry and allow for the <i>chance</i> that they may Frenzy and brutally slay someone. This is almost more of a triple bind, inasmuch as anyone in the position of having to make that choice would also have to choose whether or not to commit suicide in order to get out of it. That's three options and all of them are horrible. In retrospect, I realize we didn't really appreciate the importance of Frenzy, or how it relates to the importance and horror of feeding.<br/><br/>There's another layer to the double bind, as well. Vampires have all these bad ass powers, and they can use them to out manoeuver or destroy one another. That makes them political, competitive, and very dangerous to one another. Even if an individual vampire is not interested in dominating others, she's still in the position of having to use her powers to fight off others who are less given to respect or conscience. The problem is that these powers draw on Vitae, which means using them requires the vampire to drink sooner. So, the second double bind is this: the vampire has to decide whether to use those powers to deal with other vampires, and hurt more people in order to fuel the effort, or conserve Vitae and hurt others only as strictly necessary to survive, but remain weak and less able to defend against encroachers.<br/><br/>There are other double binds as well. The Masquerade, blood bonds, and so on are great instruments for setting them up. In the future, if I ever play this game again --- well, I might not play it with the Storyteller system, but if I ever make an AW hack for it or something, this is the angle I will play up. All the political intrigue and conspiracy would be conditioned by the practical and moral realities of vampiric existence, with Frenzy front and center.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379234/#Comment_379234" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T07:15:52+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  7:15AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vampire was a big thing as I was blossoming from a young, isolated gamer whose only connection to real tabletop play was reading books and interacting with Usenet to someone who actually had people to game with regularly. These older gamer guys I met played it almost exclusively, and I fell in with them and we played some games extrapolating all the mythology from the core book since none of us had jobs to buy the billions of supplements. I actually was never that into it, though I was fascinated by the Sabbat, until college. I was in my second year, this guy moved into town and started a Vampire LARP and had a very strong vision of How It Should Be that made it more compelling than a lot of the people-making-sarcastic-comments-while-wearing-capes LARPs that I'd seen previously. That sucked me and our entire campus gaming organization into it for like three years. So it's interesting, I think the majority of my friends from college were people I knew because of that LARP.<br/><br/>I still like it. I appreciated the OWOD weirdness and lore, and I picked up the 20th Anniversary Edition and daydream about playing it. I like the NWOD version and the way it took all the cool ideas of the old one, and cut away a lot of the stuff that made the setting hard to own and customize if you're playing in the canon setting. The last time I played was a NWOD campaign I ran. We played for three or four weeks and became frustrated by the rules and gave up. But I still enjoy reading the books and would play it again - I think I have a better understanding of how to GM it now than I did back then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379242/#Comment_379242" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T07:46:20+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  7:46AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in an online game that ran for a couple of months.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it simpy proved to be nearly the opposite of what I wanted out of gaming: it emphasized all the stupid political stuff that made RL unpleasant, with the added bonus that every PC was required to be a serial murderer.<br/><br/>I really disliked it, and still do. I think I understand intellectually why there is appeal in it, but my play experience was one of those times I had a very competent GM and good players and just found the game was outside my wheelhouse theme-wise. That's not the fault of the designers; great coffee is wasted on me too because I don't like coffee. But it's been the thing that's kept me fom ever trying a Vampire LARP, and also probably by extension kept me from trying other sorts of LARPs because of the association.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
