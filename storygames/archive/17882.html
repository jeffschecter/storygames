Were this a straight fantasy setting it might be easier to explain (it's magic duh!). But I don't want to just have it be 'done by magic', it needs to be a synergy of SF and fantasy. <br/><br/>"There are 108 Ghost Constables.<br/>When one is killed another is drawn from the ranks of the evil in society who may earn redemption by fighting evil. Redemption is measured in Joss; more commonly known as Hell Money, a spiritual payment.<br/>A suitable candidate is an evil doer saved by another Constable and brought before the mysterious Wu Kwei of the Underworld who infuse his body with the Evil Force from the Eye of Feng Du.<br/>If the candidate survives he becomes the 108th Ghost Constable. There are always and only 108 Ghost Constables. They draw their power from this number: the number of Evil.<br/>If he does not he becomes a zombie entity known as a Jiangshi and thus a slave of the Wu Kwei. These entities were once used as Feng Du\u2019s footsoldiers."<br/><br/>So how to develop these concepts in a sf context. The point of this setting is to create a synergy of wuxia chinese folklore and science fiction (as opposed to just pasting science fiction onto china).<br/>To explain some of the ideas:<br/>Feng Du is a big bad in the setting; a science sorcerer if you will. Sort of Gao Zhang or Johan Bonengel of the Buro (both from Feng Shui, the former is a eunuch sorcerer, the latter is the architect of a new world order using demons and cybernetics).<br/>The Evil Force (which i may possibly rename Yin Force, though that sounds more bland) is just that: a force of evil. Sort of 'anti Chi'. I haven't 100% defined it but it's possibly the accumulated hate of the enemies of the gods. Or maybe it incorporates nanites, which i'm not normally fond of because in rpg's nanotech is a bit of a cheap out, IMO. The Eye of Feng Du is a source of that force.<br/>Underworld - a dark region of space possibly to be renamed Underspace, if that isn't a dreadful moniker.<br/>Wu Kwei - the leaders of the Ghost Constables, the immortally suffering victims/prisoners of Feng Du from when Feng had power.<br/><br/>How to tie these together?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404647/#Comment_404647" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-26T05:42:13+00:00" title="January 26, 2013  5:42AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2013 5:42AM by UserClone.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe 108 implants were discovered at an ancient underground site found beneath a Chinese temple of some kind, and one activated and shoved itself inside the dude who found them, who then went round spreading them among people.
