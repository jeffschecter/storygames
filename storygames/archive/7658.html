Like, sometimes I hear the Producer takes a really active role in scene framing, sometimes they step back. Sometimes they hit the players with conflict, sometimes they throw NPCs at the PCs, sometimes it's player-vs-player.<br/><br/>Like, someone told me last night that they're playing PTA, but that the Producer (let's call him Sigmund) has a particular way of running it, so that the game you play is "Sigmund's PTA" rather than "True PTA". And when I've played PTA with Scott, he has his own particular tips and tricks, so that everyone says "You should play PTA with Scott".<br/><br/>So what I'd really like is a guide to those different ways of running PTA. Perhaps even authored by the Producers.<br/><br/>Good call on making everything less clear. That means more forum threads.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170038/#Comment_170038" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T06:26:10+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  6:26AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A word of warning about how easy it is to ruin a good scene by thinking too much about conflict (which is a bit like ruining a fun time with someone by thinking too much about having sex with them).

What percentage or numbers are we talking about? And is not playing with a Producer the only change they make? It seems that many of the other rules would also need to be altered.

What percentage or numbers are we talking about?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure how to figure that out without a survey.  SGBoston has played it relatively Producer-lessly for the past year or so, and we probably play it one out of every three weeks.  Basically, the budget sits at the center of the table and is spent collectively to determine the strength of challenges.  And scene framing just rotates.\n<blockquote>The current budget seems carefully calculated for a certain length game. Usually much shorter than most other RPGs. But that's on purpose as you can simple play multiple episodes in a single session and shift screen presence as predetermined.</blockquote>\nIn my mind, the budget is a tool to teach groups how to handle pacing effectively.  Like, you don't want to spend everything here because then you need some tokens for the big finale or whatever.  The problem is that, if a group has pacing under control, a lot of times the budget doesn't have enough flexibility to let you do what you want, or players aren't gaining/spending fanmail fast enough for it to replenish the budget.  Like, what happens when you reach what you know is "the conflict right before the episode ends" but you don't have the budget to actually do it justice?  You go against the group's instincts and have it happen in the next episode?  Or do you say "hell with it" and just spend imaginary surplus budget like you're the US government?<br/><br/>Basically, I think there are some cases, like in Geiger Counter, where it is warranted and highly recommendable to break the rules, especially in regards to budgeting.  PTA, in my experience, isn't a tightly balanced mechanical system.  It's a modicum of rules structure that floats on top of a much deeper well of the players' shared understanding of what should happen in their TV show, creating during the pitch and over the course of play.  But there's this meme in post-Forge design that says "the Golden Rules sucks, etc.,"  which suggests that playing strictly by the rules (and the way the author intended) is the way to get the best play out of a game. In the case of PTA, I think strict rules-adherence, at least after the group becomes comfortable with the game, is more likely to lead to <i>less</i> satisfying play than it is to lead to <i>more</i> satisfying play.<br/><br/>This is partially because, in my mind, the budget + cards system of PTA doesn't provide for a natural sense of give-and-take between the protagonists and the opposition, where a loss to the opposition makes a win more likely later, or vice versa.  The winner of a conflict is still random and, even if I have several more cards than my opponent, I can still lose pretty easily.  Fan mail mitigates this, because -- in my experience -- people often throw fan mail at the side of a conflict that they don't want to lose, but that still doesn't guide the action as strongly as, say, audience d4s do in Shock:, where, if you have a sizable audience, it almost doesn't matter what the involved protagonists roll, the audience will ultimate negotiate what happens.<br/><br/>Consequently, again -- in my experience -- there is a sense in my play of PTA that groups generally want to continue play until a satisfying or appropriate conclusion for the episode is reached, but there's not necessarily a clear sign of when that will take place, because the semi-random outcomes of conflicts often steer the narrative in unexpected directions (usually a good thing) but ones that can be hard to wrap up, such that they feel like the conclusion of an episode.  I think folks that are really good at framing conflicts can often get around this, because you can frame things such that either way the conflict goes, you'll finish with a powerful note to end on.  However, in practice, especially in pick-up games or the first few episodes of a series, when things are still getting felt out, this is pretty difficult.  I think you can see similar things in actual TV shows -- especially pilots -- where things end in a very mediocre way (Heroes pilot, Veronica Mars pilot, etc.).  In such cases, having a few more points of budget can sometimes make a big different, allowing folks to end strong or groups at least have more leeway, instead of being forced to let things peeter out.  It might be as easy as just having budget be more of a strong suggestion rather than a strictly limited pool.<br/><br/>Anyway, just some personal reflections.  I've been wrestling with some of these same issues with Geiger Counter, so I've been thinking about them a lot.  Trying to combine strict mechanics with the arbitrary decisions of the group (based on genre and themes and whatnot) is really difficult.  Something's gotta give, and I generally tend to think it's the mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170137/#Comment_170137" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T12:02:18+00:00" title="September 19, 2008 12:02PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You totally need some hot pictures of hot celebrities.

Taking a scene from Lost or something and saying "the scene is framed on the beach, one of the common sets, and Charlie is there writing a note since this is a Charley-focused episode. Charlie's issue is redemption, but he doesn't want Claire to know what he's doing to be redeemed, so there's conflict." etc. Something like this would be entertaining, but might not work for the core book because it relies on some knowledge of whatever show you use as an example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170163/#Comment_170163" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T13:05:18+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  1:05PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite><br/><br/>you need to use the word "pig" more often.<br/><br/>Furthermore, you should put in a part in the Introduction where you talk about how awesome I am, and how the game wouldn't be the same without me.<br/></blockquote>\nI think I see a way to combine these two items...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170173/#Comment_170173" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T13:24:24+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  1:24PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, thanks for the responses!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170179/#Comment_170179" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T13:39:35+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  1:39PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a side note, Eric runs budget in PTA like budget in Agon, trying to give you as much opposition as possible with a limited set of resources.

(No one ever does.)  But I was serious then, and I am serious now.  Maybe if I make this case in a more public arena, people more credible than me can talk some sense into you.<br/>\n<br/>\nPremise: With PTA, you have <i>the</i> breakthrough game.<br/>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\na.) Not everyone understands ancient, inconceivably evil cockroaches or Buddhist elves or George Washington in clockwork power armor, but everyone understands television.<br/>\nb.) There are movements to turn people away from TV to doing more social activities.  There are the anti-TV people, the Kill Your Television week people, etc.  What better way to fight TV than with a make-your-own-TV-series game?<br/>\nc.) There are groups that are looking for ways to teach people to look at media critically, not just blindly imbibe it.  What better way to understand TV and how shows are structured than to make TV shows within a game.<br/>\nd.) You have a game that is friendly to new players and that allows people to make better TV shows than they can watch on their TV.  It uses common playing cards, which everyone has at home (except for people who associate them with dancing, drinking, smoking and cussing).</ul>\n<br/>\nSo, design an edition of PTA aimed at the general public.  On the back, there's a picture of you, wearing a cardigan and sitting in your study.  There's a cat in your lap, you're holding a remote, and you are looking at the reader, half smiling, half thoughtful.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrategy:<br/>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\na.) Far enough in advance of your tour, draw up an itinerary.  You are choosing cities with lots of bookstores and radio stations that fall along a roughly circular route.<br/>\nb.) Then, send press releases to the newspapers, public radio stations, radio stations with local talk formats and morning TV talk shows in those towns.  You are trying to set up interviews in conjunction with Turn Off Your TV Week.  Contact bookstores and set up signings and readings.    If you're brave, contact college Communications and Education departments, and arrange to speak to students about the use of PTA for Media Education and the DIY Media Revolution, or whatever.<br/>\nc.) While you're at it, contact the national groups involved with media education and turning off TVs, and let them know about your upcoming tour and the possibility of tie-ins with their activities.<br/>\nd.) Starting the four weeks running through Kill Your TV week, do the following: Rent a van.  Fill it up with as many crates of PTA as you're willing to sell. Then go on your road trip and do those interviews and book signings and readings, and sell the hell out your game.  Leave bookstores the information for ordering more copies.  Just be sure to leave town before people fully realize that you have just sold them an RPG.<br/>\ne.) Eventually, before your four weeks are up, the national press will catch up with you and your subversive game, and you'll be on Letterman and Colbert, and somewhere inside of Newsweek and Time.</ul>\n<br/>\nFrom then on, it will just be money pouring in.  If you change society enough by turning people from entertainment consumers to entertainment creators, maybe they'll give you a Nobel Prize.  I'm not sure which one.  Maybe the committee will have to invent one just for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are still not up to this project, then put my photo on the back of your book.  I'll be Matt Wilson for a month.  I'll try not to tarnish your reputation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>(Edited several times because I still don't understand BBCode.)</i><br/>\n<i>(Edited once more to minimize religious stereotypes and to remove

Both can work, but they can also quickly derail the game into being very very silly or very very sluggish and confusing. I think it'd be good to address this somehow and pointing out that a show that's too far out there might run out of steam before the pilot is done, and a show that's too much like your regular GURPS game might play very differently to what you're used to or even comfortable with. <br/><br/>As a Producer, I've often found myself trying to encourage some people to think more out of the box ("Don't just try to open the door, try to figure out what your character is actually after!") and at the same time encouraging others to think a little more inside the box ("the existentialist dilemma in the search for God as a meta-textual comment on consumerism is a pretty abstract idea... how about breaking it down a little?") to get the game going. I can imagine this balancing act might not be readily apparent to anybody picking up PTA for the first time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171095/#Comment_171095" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T20:26:31+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  8:26PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would be nice to see guidelines along the lines of only narrating what the tv viewer sees, rather than what characters are feeling, or what they have planned.

With nobody to push for conflict we ended up with a lot of aimless and unsatisfying play. While I can buy that a lot of the failing was the result of local circumstances, I think it's important to at least note the pitfalls of Producerless play and the need to distribute that role differently if you cut the Producer out. When I read the game it looked to me like: "Gee, all I'd be eliminating is a GM with no Narrative Authority. . .yeah, fuck that, I wanna play a Protagonist!"<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171553/#Comment_171553" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T14:11:36+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  2:11PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Yasha</cite>Premise: With PTA, you have<em>the</em>breakthrough game.<br/><br/>So, design an edition of PTA aimed at the general public.

I've been saying this for months, but no one seems to believe me.  Yes, absolutely. Make it clear enough for non-gamers to pick up and play, and then target them with a vengence.  Although I wouldn't do any traditional book tour stuff, only best sellers do it any more, anyone less than a certain fame treshhold end up not making up the travel costs in sales.  But, do hit small and local media venues, gatherings, bookstores and social clubs and iron out the tools to give your your legions of fans to do the same in their neck of the woods.  Of course, none of this has anything directly to do with revising the book except that you should have all this in mind when you think of writing to your audience.  Your potential audience isn't gamers who love TV. Its every person who has ever been a fan of a TV show or thought "It would be fun to make my own show".  I'm not saying everyone who watches TV are your potential sales, or even audience numbers for Lost or CSI. But something more like Firefly or 30 Rock, in the single digit millions?

gamers to play: Star Wars, Buffy, Firefly, Exalted, Naruto, etc?  I used to be VERY angry about the lack of desire to run original settings and such, but I have mellowed considerably on that issue once I realized that it is because you have a setting that comes pre-built with the creative shorthands that make play possible initially, rather than building it from scratch.<br/><br/>I still prefer to roll my own (so to speak), but then again I am a dirty, capitalist free-former.

Maybe that's too much for this round--but PtA totally does have that potential. Luck!\n<blockquote>On another note. . .I'll offer as a datapoint that when I first got PTA I tried it Producerless with two inexperienced (read: brand new) roleplayers, and it was fairly disastrous. With nobody to push for conflict we ended up with a lot of aimless and unsatisfying play.</blockquote>\nThis is closer to what I've experienced too, with a weak producer. Either way, I'd ask for strong guidance for how anyone--whether it is one Producer, or the group as a whole--can balance a forward moving plot with development of characters. I've seen this flow like wine when the pitch session produces a strong plot that ties in with all the characters, and seen it sputter and wander aimlessly when it doesn't. <br/><br/>So guidelines for what makes the outcome of a pitch session sing, as well as examples and guidelines for ratcheting up the tension would be great. Maybe you should go sit in on Jonathan's group to see what they are all doing. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I guess ideally you'd do that with them, and then also visit the strong Producer Boston SG'er's game too. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> We'll all be happy to have you come north more!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Or scratch that comment if you are not going for ensemble play, lol<br/>\n3) The Producer has to wail on the players with their budget early, so there is enough fan mail to award. Make that explicit and make sure that both the players and producer know that the players might have to lose their first few conflicts in the first few scenes in order to fuel the fan mail mechanic. We didn't do this in our game, then we got out of the habit of awarding fan mail and then the game lost its funnest mechanic<br/>\n4) Yeah, you don't have to drive towards conflict, some of the un-fun was brought about by a hard drive towards conflict.<br/>\n5) Timing - Events don't have to occur sequentially. By this I mean, everyone at the table should feel free to frame the next scene a week later after the last scene. Even if it was a juicy scene. We hit a lot of awkward bits because it was hard to come up with a new scene that happened 5 minutes after the last scene. I tried to push people to make it be the next day, but no one was biting.<br/>\n6) Spell it out - One of the players has an awesome Issue, but because they didn't spell it out, the whole group missed out on it until their spotlight episode (which unfortunately was the last epi). Encourage the players to ask questions and explain things ab out their characters, talking is good.<br/>\n7) More tips on "Coming up next" - We really sucked at this. Even after we got the hang of the game around Epi 3, we never got "Next Week on" right. We usually hit about half of them and the other half never got used, ever. I think the fluid nature of the scene framing makes that kind of prophecy almost impossible. Or, I just didn't have the right tips/tricks to make it happen...<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brenton" title="Brenton"><img alt="Brenton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brenton">Brenton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195316/#Comment_195316" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-03T15:04:27+00:00" title="March  3, 2009  3:04PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a ton of "frequent problems" threads all over the internet.  There really must be a very firm, obvious list of suggestions and "frequent mistakes" in the back of the book.  Make it very clear that these are things that, when done, make first-time games go very badly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list should include:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The Producer frames all the scenes.  Player simply request them.  Make this more obvious in the actual scene mechanics, too.  Make a point of saying that it is not classic scene framing.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Not spending enough Budget early on<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Not awarding enough Fan Mail<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Prenarrating the outcomes of scenes in the stakes<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Making stakes task-based instead of conflict-based<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Worrying too much about time elapsing between scenes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, offering several examples of bad conflicts would be a great idea.  It's easy to see what you should do from good examples, but it is really hard to see what kind of mistakes you're likely to make.  Show specific examples of badly-framed scenes by the producer (and player-framed scenes), bad conflict stakes, and bad end-of-scene narration.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, offer more advice on how to create and incorporate the "Next time on..." scenes.  Perhaps offer a mechanical advantage to using the ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7658/im-out-of-books" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7658/im-out-of-books" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7658/im-out-of-books/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7658%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7658%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
