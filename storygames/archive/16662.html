I'm citing you for the following statement, "In RZR, player's begin as...", in which the word players should not have an apostrophe.

I seem to be particularly blind to my own mistakes-- my brain just glosses right over the error, automatically filling in what should be there.

It's really hard to do that on the internet without giving offense. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm interested in the mechanics, too, although I don't have a good handle on how the will work out in actual play.

A few hopefully constructive comments:<br/><br/>1. The threat level seems like it will be too high to me. Even in round one your scene threat is going to be at least 3 (two times the round number plus one for the minimum number of PCs involved), probably higher. You have to spend that many action points to act. You'll be out of action points pretty damn quick unless you ruthlessly focus on stuff where you have a negative modifier. (That may be deliberate, of course, but it looks like being severely limiting.)<br/><br/>2. It could use a proof-read. I spotted a few things:<br/>- You say the threat level is calculated by multiplying the round by two - I guess you mean the round number? Could be a bit clearer.<br/>- Though it's implicit that they can, you don't actually say whether a player can act more than once in a scene.<br/>- You refer to the scenario ending when the threat pool is reduced to zero, but the threat pool is based on the round number and could presumably go up indefinitely. Perhaps you meant "round" rather than "scenario", but if so you're repeating yourself. from an earlier para.<br/>- You refer to ability points increasing on a refresh, should say action points.<br/><br/>3. I'd say it would be helpful to include some guidance on how to set up and play the game. I don't mean mechanically or procedurally, just, like, how to frame a good scene, maybe some examples of how play works, that kind of thing.<br/><br/>Good luck with it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moyashi" title="Moyashi"><img alt="Moyashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moyashi">Moyashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392575/#Comment_392575" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-06T19:03:47+00:00" title="October  6, 2012  7:03PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2012 7:07PM by Moyashi.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback, everyone.

I'll go back and look at the game again later this month after the <a href="http://allanablog.blogspot.jp/" rel="nofollow">All Analog Games Weekend</a>wraps up. With luck, it will be out there in time for your Halloween sessions.<br/>Oh, yeah, proofreading. I have some feeble excuses, but you are all correct.
