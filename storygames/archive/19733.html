The adventure is what happens during the session, and I would like to see some roleplaying games that enforced how to play a session. I will therefor take a lot of different roleplaying games and see how they explain how a scenario should be written, because there is where I think the game actually exist.\n<h4>Method</h4>Each game in this thread will have<blockquote>1. Its name and edition,<br/>2. a short quotation to show what the game is about,<br/>3. followed by a summarized version of the step by step procedure used to create the scenario.</blockquote>It might follow a personal comment about that procedure. Feel free to contribute with more games using this structure.<br/><br/><b>How To Sort Each Method Into Different Models</b><br/>I will also use a couple of terms along the way to loosely categorize the roleplaying games in this thread to help me with future analysis. I will try to read with on open mind and apply all terms accordingly until one, or more, categories fits the game. The first sentence in each explanation is the requirement I have to see if it's fits that particular category.\n<blockquote><i>Sequential play:</i> have a linear structure of one scene leading to another. There are several substructures of sequential play. \xbbLinear play\xab has fixed scenes from start to end. \xbbAssembly play\xab has scenes that must happen but can happen in any order. \xbbBallistic play\xab has a fixed beginning and end but the path between those two is unclear. Sequential play is used to create a sensation for the players.<br/><br/><i>Fish tank:</i> focuses on the revealing relations between different factions to the players, to make either the players act or the factions react to the players' actions. Often suitable for mysteries or intrigues.<br/><br/><i>Sandbox:</i> creates places for the players to explore. You can see it as an amusement park, where the players can pick any ride in any order. Each place can have factions and occurring events. It's mostly a model used for exploring and discovering.<br/><br/><i>Bang driven:</i> the model gives out flags to the players and each flag is a signal for what the player wants the adventure to be about. From these flags, the game master creates \xbbbangs\xab to invoke emotional or moral choices. It's not a model I've used at all, only experienced as a player, but I guess bangs are best used for creating drama through dilemmas.<br/><br/><i>Collaborative storytelling:</i> improvising a plot, story, setting, or the background of any of these. It's a model that embraces self-expression, creativity, and the feeling of togetherness.</blockquote>\nWhen I feel that I got enough material, I will start to compare the different games and their structures.\n<h4>Discussions Should Be Taken Elsewhere</h4>Please take any discussion <i>about the purpose of this thread</i> elsewhere. This includes short comments, discussions about any game, or any definition of the terms, which might change or be expanded during the course of this thread. Any meta-discussion will be linked to from both this post and the post that spawned that discussion.<br/><br/>[edit 4] <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19758/discussion-about-thread-an-analysis-of-different-methods-of-adventure-writing" rel="nofollow">Discussion About Thread "An Analysis of Different Methods of Adventure Writing"</a><br/><br/>[edit] Changed the topic of this thread.<br/>[edit 2] Described how I applied the categories to each game.<br/>[edit 3] Added the last sentence about linking to meta-discussions.<br/>[edit 5] Made the requirements for each category more clear.
