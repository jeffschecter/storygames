I was thinking about using "Yes and...", "Yes but..." etc in making games, and writing Erstwhile and Emily was an attempt to think about how those methods could be used to structure play.

It's a sign of great health, in such a culture as ours.<br/><br/>I have the impression that a lot of those posting a game in the challenge, "published" their first game in that thread. And that too, to me, is significant. Putting a game out there is something very special to do. Having finished and published a game, however small, brings you to a new level of thought as a game-smith. <br/><br/>From this I take that a bunch of game-smiths have taken a small, but significant, step further by meeting the challenge. And that makes the challenge a small part of the greater movement of developing role-playing games for the future. To make role-playing games grow as a form, we need to have a good supply of new blood. Challenges and competitions are ways of inviting new blood into the ranks. Having more game-smiths actually turning out games for people to see, is great for the culture. It infuses it with new thoughts and greater confidence, and helps raise the intellectual level of discussion. Beeing peers with hands-on experience in design, is a good fundament for constructive dialogue.<br/><br/>The 5 minutes challenge is a small part of this, in my eyes, a part that helps budding designers close in on the real target;<br/>- publishing an independently conceived, solidly designed and original role-playing game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimD" title="JimD"><img alt="JimD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimD">JimD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365893/#Comment_365893" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T06:44:58+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  6:44AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas:  Yes.  I agree with your assessment wholeheartedly.  While I don't think the results are by any means groundbreaking, I will admit that it's one of the small ways I've been able to fruitfully communicate with this community as a whole, and for reasons of my own design, not any sort of failure on your (collective) part.<br/><br/>I will freely admit that the stuff I've been posting in both the five-minute and two-word challenges has been total crap.  I knew it going in, that it was just mechanics, or not that interesting.  I'm trying to get past the idea that things don't necessarily have to be "good enough", you just have to get them out there, and it's that very process that makes you better.  Unless you're a prodigy, the first product you produce will never be rockstar material.  That being said, it's *extremely* intimidating to just jump into a group that very clearly knows what it's doing, probably far better than I do, who've had the kind of amazing, thought-provoking epiphanies years ago that I am just now seeking and acquiring, and it leads to, I confess, a feeling of inadequacy.  It's a hard thing to overcome, and if I can find a place somewhere where I can at least try to be a force to say something that hasn't been said, I'm going to jump on that crap hardcore, because maybe I'll be able to learn, or get over myself, enough that my options expand a little bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_366039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366039/#Comment_366039" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T12:37:17+00:00" title="March  8, 2012 12:37PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see your position, Jim.

Having finished and published a game, however small, brings you to a new level of thought as a game-smith.<br/><br/>From this I take that a bunch of game-smiths have taken a small, but significant, step further by meeting the challenge. And that makes the challenge a small part of the greater movement of developing role-playing games for the future. To make role-playing games grow as a form, we need to have a good supply of new blood. Challenges and competitions are ways of inviting new blood into the ranks. Having more game-smiths actually turning out games for people to see, is great for the culture. It infuses it with new thoughts and greater confidence, and helps raise the intellectual level of discussion. Beeing peers with hands-on experience in design, is a good fundament for constructive dialogue.</blockquote>\nAs an architect, I have an tortured relationship with profession (all architects seem to have this problem!).  On the one hand, I have a very strong professional pride, I have specialized skills and knowledge I proudly make a living off of it.  On the other hand, there are enough atrocities in the built environment, usually by architects, that I question the value of our profession when it comes to pure design.  After all, if you boil things down, the government recognizes us as a special profession because they thinks its important that buildings are designed in a way to give its inhabitants an opportunity to safely escape the structure in the event of a fire.<br/><br/>But still, I want to think that all my years in school and aesthetic training means something more than great fire escapes!  And in my travels I have been to some awesome spaces designed by justly famous architects...but I have also been to some awful spaces designed by equally famous architects, hell my office building is designed by IM Pei with cramped awful lobby and an insipid urban plaza!  And when I think about the built environment, the places that evoke my fondest memories are organic vernacular growths - the market street near my girlfriend's grandma's apartment in Hangzhou, a quiet residential street in Berkeley, the surging density of Manhattan, a nondescript cafe in Paris.  What is missing in architecture school - and thus in much of our professionally designed environments - is a healthy respect of the fabric of our environments.  The occasional iconic structure is important for our cities, but a city of icons is nothing but a jumbled mess -- a jumbled mess that suppresses the expression of a vital social life.<br/><br/>Unlike urban design, most arts do not need to be concerned with the vernacular fabric that surrounds it.  After all we go to an art museum to experience great iconic paintings, not to ponder the torrents of mediocre visual productions by those whose works fill our dentists' office today.  And generally you don't want audience participation, its a good thing that all those fat drunk people in the stands don't have any real affect on what was actually happens on the basketball court.  Furthermore, it means nothing to the great artist when the random plebe dabbles in their art, Kobe doesn't give a shit if you shoot hoops in the driveway after a long day at the office.  In some ways, games fit in this type of individual art. There are great iconic games with great designers, and it doesn't really affect their lives nor change their art if their audience occasionally dabbles in game design.<br/><br/>And yet, story games are not a passive art. This is a social activity, you don't sit there and just watch pixels dancing on the monitor, you have to get in and participate to make it worth everyone else's while. A great movie is still awesome in a half empty theater, but with these games, if the audience is flat the end product will be weak -- no matter matter how awesome, how elegant, how conceptually beautiful the game design. Understanding rules and mechanics is merely scratching the surface, and the beauty of these games is found in the moment of emergent wonder when everything snaps together to create a memorable experience.  And for that to best happen, you need an active, educated and involved community of people who invest themselves into the art.<br/><br/>I presume that the most important way to become a good game player is to practice gaming, but I have to believe that it is a useful exercise for everyone to dabble in game design. Instead of working with material that is just handed to you, it is a scary thing to be faced with with a blank page and be forced to come up with something, anything. You can learn things by designing that you don't notice by just playing games, the act of design is a powerful exercise, and even if someone decides that game designing is not their thing, hopefully they walk away with a more insight into what it takes to create a game. <br/><br/>I think the difference between some of the earlier comments and Tomas's enthusiasm boils down to this.  Yes, ideas are cheap, and if one was to look carefully at the actual 5-minute games I'd suspect most of them are pure crap. It takes a lot of work to turn an idea into a decent game and even more to turn it into a product worth publishing. But to completely dismiss the exercise is overstating the case. Very few people have the dedication to go through the effort to become an accomplished game designer -- this is an intimidating fact; there are valuable lessons to be learned in designing a game. And that paradox is the essence of this exercise, lets make the act of designing a game as non-intimidating as possible to get people to jump in and play with process of game design. Of course there are more valuable lessons that will be only learned from a sustained effort, but you gotta start somewhere, and the 5 minute game design was about exactly that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_366223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366223/#Comment_366223" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T09:03:18+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  9:03AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Justus!

Even if you think you have a stroke of genius, the slightest bit of prodding at that nascent state would show major issues that could easily derail the usability initial idea. Whatever the creative endeavor, it is the refining process that takes initial-spark-ideas and turns them into more complete "thoughts"...and generally the refining process entails taking the spark-idea and doing a lot of bad iterations/developments of that idea until something halfway decent come out.<br/><br/>So I guess its an issue of unnuanced internet tone, but when I say ideas are cheap and generally crummy, I mean to say it in a fond way -- in that you gotta start somewhere, and usually its not pretty.  But that's where we all start.  The next step - and out of the scope of the exercise - as you say is to mine the ideas and develop them further, but that was out of the scope of this exercise.<br/><br/>And by the way I quite like the idea of "game-craft".  Reminds me of a book, How Buildings Learn.  Its not written by an architect, but I really like his provcative theory that one of the major problems of Architecture is that they want to view themselves as an art or a science, but one is too capricous and the other too rigid.  He felt it would be a much better approach to view architecture as a craft, which makes a lot of sense.  Its an interesting book, worth checking out (though I'm not sure how applicable it would be to game-craft, though maybe the ideas of accretion and changes over time might be particularly relevant to RPGs as opposed to other types of game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_366377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366377/#Comment_366377" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T22:20:43+00:00" title="March  9, 2012 10:20PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm quite comfortable viewing game-design as both craft and art.

And I do not see it as very constructive either; you may work as hard to make your ideas grow into a beautiful work of art, even if you consider some ideas to be the golden nuggets you need to believe in your work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aaarg_ink" title="aaarg_ink"><img alt="aaarg_ink" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.grizzlypear.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/pepper32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aaarg_ink">aaarg_ink</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366391/#Comment_366391" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T05:10:00+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  5:10AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahh see, for me it is empowering to think that all ideas start off weak.  I believe strong ideas come out of weak ideas that have been carefully developed and nurtured into strong ideas.  Its a more of a mindgame for me.  The problem in thinking that there are "great concepts" to be discovered out there, is that I end up constantly seeking "better" design concepts in lieu of actually taking a reasonable design concept and developing it (this is more of an architecture school issue).  To be clear, I'm not saying all ideas are *equally* crap.  I'm just saying that all initial concepts have major issues that need to be resolved through hard work and diligent development. Some ideas are worth developing, and some are just completely dead on arrival -- recognizing what idea has potential is a key task of a designer.  But after having found a decent starting concept, continually looking for a "better greater idea" is a recipe for getting nowhere, you just keep starting over, you waste your time chasing your tail while someone who spends their efforts developing a decent idea will very likely get much further.<br/><br/>Funny thing is that this approach to architecture design in school also applies to architecture craft in the practice.  Its most obvious when you draw up construction details for a building -- which is inherently an intimidating task because that's where the rubber hits the road.  Especially when you are new to the practice, you won't know exactly how something is put together so when you are tasked to detail something, staring at the blank page can get really scary.  There are a lot of components in a building, and you need to draw it up calling out all the right components at all the right spots, and if you draw it wrong the contractor will build it wrong, and then the building will have a flaw, and then in five years there will be a failure, and then your firm will get sued.....its really easy to psyche yourself out and freeze up! So I always tell my less experienced colleagues -- and often to myself -- the first detail is going to wrong, in fact you'll most likely draw three or four shitty versions of the same detail before you get it right.  But that's just the way it is, so get over it, the sooner you draw the crappy versions the quicker you'll get to the right one.<br/><br/>As I write it out it sure does sound like a strange pessimistic design philosophy...but its worked well for me. Design is a mind game, and I have no doubt other folks have a more optimistic mind game that they play with themselves.  But mine is definitely all about embracing initial failings -- avoiding the ultimate failure of stalemate by overthinking things too much at the start. <br/><br/>Funny thing is that I don't at all intend to sound dismissive of the 5-minute exercise -- there is a powerful energy in great brain storming sessions and a joy of discovery with all these ideas coming from all directions! All project start somewhere and I believe that loose freeflowing brainstorming sessions are one of the best ways of getting a lot of ideas on the wall -- and the more ideas you throw up, the more likely you'll find one that will be a good starting point.  But I'm also keenly aware that the next step will take a lot of work.  But hey!  The next step ALWAYS takes a lot of work, so why be a downer?  In my last paragraph of the initial post I meant to acknowledge that "yes, I am certain that all those games in the thread had serious issues, but it seems silly to dismiss the 5-exercise for what it isn't.(a practice of fully developed thorough game design)."  I certainly enjoyed the exercise for what it was, a collective creative push in throwing things ideas up into the air, a maelstrom of community brain activity.<br/><br/>(disclaimer:  For anyone else following the thread, it might be pretty obvious that I have stayed extremely general in my comments about design with almost nothing said about rpg design.  Well, I'm an avid boardgamer but I only recently discovered rpg's and even though I have been avidly reading a bunch of rpg game rules, the fact remains that to date I have only had one storygame/rpg session, a game of fiasco.  As such I find the discussion of design and games in something of interest to me, but I have little to say about the genre though it is certainly the center of my free-time attention at the moment!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371275/#Comment_371275" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T17:36:09+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  5:36PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2012 6:39PM by Snake_Eyes.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">@TomasHVM</a><br/><br/>Sorry for posting in the other thread, and thank you very much for your feedback.<br/><br/>What would people think about a 15 or 20 minute RP Challenge?<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_371277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371277/#Comment_371277" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T17:41:51+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  5:41PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No need to be sorry!

(Also I used Office to do the typing rather than the post box.)<br/><br/>Given 15 minutes to design I would have maybe added a seventh skill (Fiery Temperament), and tried to work on the middle of the game, where I felt I would not be able to explain myself in the time limit.<br/><br/>Given 30 minutes to design I think I would have included some additional random elements so that it was not such a political game. I would have also written an introduction, and a better end game. I might have made it about Titanocracy rather than Christian Apocalypse.)<br/><br/>In summary it was stressful as hell, it would be easier to give a verbal pitch with some rough drawings, typing is not my main forte.<br/><br/>I really was inspired by a lot of the other entries, and based the characters I my assumptions of a RP that I have not read or played, but knew of the general idea.<br/><br/>Thanks everyone,<br/>\\o/ Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_371290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371290/#Comment_371290" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T18:28:19+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  6:28PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The spirit of the thing is to design fast, with no hesitation; to do! <br/>You did! <br/>And that's perfect!<br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371292/#Comment_371292" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T18:31:02+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  6:31PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, Victorian, the game is still <i>yours</i>.
