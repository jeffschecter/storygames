So far so good.<br/><br/>The thing is, thanks to being so thoroughly burned out by Magic, I don't play much of any card games, so I don't have a whole lot to draw inspiration from when it comes to card game type mechanics. I want to make it so that characters have Quirks (Tsundere, Space Cadet, Diligent, etc.) to define themselves, and I'm thinking these should let the players do different things with the cards when they come into play (for good or ill; in some cases you can get an "advantage" for making your character look silly), but I have no idea what, aside from perhaps treating certain cards as wild cards.<br/><br/>What other interesting things could one do with cards?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118917/#Comment_118917" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-10T02:57:30+00:00" title="January 10, 2008  2:57AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matching suits can build power, no matter the number.<br/><br/>"Combos" can occur for specific numbers (666?) or specific suit combinations (Hearts + Diamonds = New Love Interest).<br/><br/>Just the thoughts that immediately pop up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118918/#Comment_118918" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-10T04:09:08+00:00" title="January 10, 2008  4:09AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Say you have 4 suits, each corresponding to a D&amp;D-style attribute.  <br/><br/>Might +5<br/>Agility -1<br/>Insight+2<br/>Will +3<br/><br/>The player has a hand of cards; if they're doing a Might action and they play a Might card, the card is trump, so you draw another card immediately and add that.

With three attributes in a playing card (Suit, Rank and Color), one can take all the advice for that base card or one of them. (or perhaps state what card attributes are viable/enhanced)<br/><br/>This could also be added by each player laying down 4 cards (one "bid" for each "panel") from their hand before any of the base cards are revealed. Combined with the idea that characters would most likely have stats that alter the results of cards they use (maybe some can offer simple die rolling or coin flipping) can make the game more strategic in a sense.<br/><br/>Rewards for winning a "strip" and good role playing could give players extra card draws, hand sizes, discard/redraws.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119066/#Comment_119066" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-10T19:57:32+00:00" title="January 10, 2008  7:57PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony:<br/><br/>That's a cool twist on the basic concept!

The girl in my example, having dumped a whole bunch of spades cards in on the pile, is totally screwed if she now wants to have a change of heart and nurture a relationship with the boy.  It actually motivates her not to accept changing circumstance until she's absolutely forced to.

(h/t Ross)<br/><br/>So, every so often I remember Dvorak, and click over to <a href="http://dvorakgame.co.uk/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">the site</a> to geek out over it.  It's a bloody brilliant game framework devised by Kevan Davis with a few simple rules:  Choose or make a deck.  There are two types of card, Actions and Things.  Deal five cards to each player.  On your turn, play an Action and/or Thing card.  If it's an Action, do what it says.  If it's a Thing, it stays in front of you.  You win when you achieve whatever the victory conditions are for the game you're playing.  Making a deck comes from a Nomic-like process where everyone votes on the cards, or everyone just decides on a basic framework for the game and starts making cards.   The cards and rules are as extensible as you want them to be, and there are <a href="http://dvorakgame.co.uk/index.php/Category:Decks" rel="nofollow">hundreds of them</a> already created.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393978/#Comment_393978" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T15:14:34+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  3:14PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neko, you can try this:<br/><br/>Each quirk is related to an specific suit. Whenever other player uses that suit your quirk is "activated" in a way that makes you look silly (however that should be rewarded by other players or the gm with the game currency, being ths cards or whatever you like.) When the quirk is activated you may interrupt the current scene by briefly narrating one action of your character, which suddenly appears in this scene or the next and does something related to her quirk.<br/><br/>If you want to reduce the incidence of these interruptions you can limit to a single card number, so, let's say, whenever an 8 is played, all tsundere characters suddenly appear out of nowhere to crush whoever played that card.<br/><br/>I don't reccomend you to have any sort of hit points in this game, just for the sake of turning any kind of physical violence into commedy relief. You can re-activate the lethality of the game for one scene whenever the ace of spaces is played, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393990/#Comment_393990" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T15:59:56+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  3:59PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man.
