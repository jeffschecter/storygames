She didn't really know what it was about, so the hardest part was explaining it to her, and it was probably complicated by my knowing so many systems that I could never give a clear answer, so we ended up sliding through suggesting a couple variations of D&amp;D, HackMaster and then A Dirty World. She liked that idea the best. She then talked to one of her friends about it, who seemed interested. Said friend's boyfriend heard the conversation on the other end and perked up at the word "game". So asking 1 person to play has got me a group of 3 new people to play with. <br/><br/>Not surprisingly, that's how I started. One of my brother's friends introduced us to gaming in a "Hey, here's a cool game, let's play it" way when we were kids, and in a school with a student base of ~26, I had a solid group of 3 people playing, who I also got just by asking. 10% of the school playing D&amp;D regularly, with it occasionally swelling to 30% I think is pretty good. <br/><br/>Anybody else have similarly easy experiences that fly in the face of the somewhat popular notion (which I've held, strangely enough, despite the aforementioned experiences with school) that something drastic needs to be done to make the hobby appealing to new people?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224815/#Comment_224815" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T02:13:47+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  2:13AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Make the hobby appealing to new people" in part means that it draws people out of the street, that someone will pick up the game from a store without a friend talking to them about it.<br/><br/>That's much harder to accomplish, not just with RPGs, but even with books, where we often rely on word-of-mouth.<br/><br/>Friendship with someone is a good way to help getting them to agree to an activity you propose <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224817/#Comment_224817" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T03:18:04+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  3:18AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't D&amp;D already do that though?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224821/#Comment_224821" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T05:01:10+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  5:01AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does it?

If DnD truly did <i>that</i>, then in every big town a couple dozen people would pick up the books, each on their own with no knowledge of the others, and then they'd converge and play.<br/><br/>What happens is that D&amp;D is appealing enough to attract a single player, or a couple, and then they draw their friends to play with them. Their friends don't play with them because the "RPG Hobby" is appealing enough to them, they don't really care about it. They are playing because their friends are playing, and they want to engage in an activity with their friends. Then the RPG aspect may appeal to them and they'll keep at it even separate from their friends, but it's not the same as RPGs themselves appealing to them.<br/><br/>It's the non-unique aspect of "Social activity with people I like" that they find appealing, with the side bonus of "My friend's excited about it, he's my friend, so let's see what he likes, and help him have fun."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224846/#Comment_224846" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T09:29:32+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  9:29AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If that's the case, then no RPG would be able to do it better than D&amp;D, because the best they could hope for is to attract people who will invite their friends to play.<br/><br/>D&amp;D does, however get new people to play the game, it's somewhat of a known quantity, and it's very easily available.
