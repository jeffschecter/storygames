Updates to come.<br/><br/>Hey everyone, thanks for taking a look at my thread! <br/><br/>I've recently been working on a *World hack with which to play an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion" rel="nofollow">Evangelion</a> game, focusing mostly on representation of canonical 'magic' effects of the AT Field, the berserk state, and extremely dangerous combat. Tying it all together into a cohesive whole has been the primary labor of this work, mostly because there are so many separate events and effects that I feel should have ripples throughout play.<br/><br/>At this point the things I've drawn and altered from other *World games are:<br/>- combat and damage mechanics from The Regiment<br/>- stats and moves from Apocalypse World and Dungeon World, and fan-made playbooks for them<br/>- equipment and customization from Adeptus Evangelion<br/>- Strings from Monsterhearts<br/><br/>Something that is a big step away from *World games is a sort of 'soft-playbook' idea; not only do you have background effects, but you also have your career moves, Evangelion equipment and Unit Type effects, and weapon or equipment use. Whether or not this idea will blow up in my face, I'm not sure yet! Play-testing begins next week, so we'll see. Some of the playbooks are still in the idea stage at this point, too, but there are certainly enough to play with the basic mechanics.<br/><br/>Oh, and I cut out individual XP - you advance after every sortie versus the enemy. Because Evangelion is quite thematically arranged around each Angel (18 in the original series), I thought it appropriate to have Advancement based around those milestones. <br/><br/>At this point I would really like it if more experienced *World players and hackers could take a look over what I have so far. Is it too much? Too little? Too many or too few subsystems?<br/><br/>Thank you for your attention!<br/><br/>Link to project: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u1TRAXu_MsW6xhvMb8-R1rnr_baLRA-uY_9K4HmqAEI/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Google Doc Link</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416132/#Comment_416132" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T22:51:27+00:00" title="June 12, 2013 10:51PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool, bookmarked this thread.

It would be too easy to make it a giant stompy robot game with the players going all cowboy.  I could see doing things like randomizing the angel attributes and tactics  [Maybe with huge lists like Maid.]  I'd also be open to seriously removing or twisting plot elements and changing all the motives of the various NPCs/organizations.  I want <i>my</i> disturbing and unsettling giant robot game and it might have a completely different ending than the original series had.  All the pilots should have some serious psychological flaw, perhaps being a little bit insane is required for the job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Killy" title="Killy"><img alt="Killy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/669/nBHMHULXQGKOR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Killy">Killy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416143/#Comment_416143" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T05:20:31+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  5:20AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's hard to codify certain plot elements of Evangelion that are implicit to the viewer, such as the mysteries and body-horror, but also keep the players from turning into the Scooby Gang at the first sign of trouble.<br/><br/>Instead of showing plot horrors, I've tried to convey the incredible stresses of Evangelion combat, and the constant risk of failure therein. One way I'm trying to do that is with the Stress-Rejection and Strain system; when a character goes stress critical (see: The Regiment) they may trigger a rejection by one (or more) of their peers, who take on relationship strain. Too much strain, and you lash out at the person on the other end of the strained bond. <br/><br/>To keep people from coming to blows though, it's not restricted to insults. Anything sufficiently upsetting to the target character will suffice, such as The Silent Treatment\u2122 or saying "I love you" just as you take a killing blow in their place. <br/><br/>As for NPC's and organization, I'll leave that entirely in the GM's hands with the Front/Danger systems of AW and DW.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416147/#Comment_416147" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T05:41:29+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  5:41AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Watching making it too combat heavy, I would say less than 5% of the show was about combat, The real problems are the tension between pilots, and the tension between them and those telling them what to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416148/#Comment_416148" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T05:42:43+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  5:42AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, why do you have careers?

I don't think it will be entirely relevant (even just from the description on the site, lots of sex, and I'm not sure that's a big part of Evangelion) but I think it'd be a great assisstant.<br/><br/>Also Profiles is a great substitute for careers in my opinion.<br/><br/>For me personally, something that stood out in Evangelion was the sheer sense of scale of the Evas. Even the shortest Eva is over double the height of your average Gundam, putting the battles on a colossal stage. I don't know if that's mechanically representable, but it's a thing that made Evangelion memorable to me.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/revel911">@revel911</a>: I'm gonna bounce that around a bit. I totally see what you're saying, but I kinda disagree. Aside from the fact that as far as <i>thrilling</i> goes, I think the greatest aspect was the combat (maybe not the most <i>interesting</i> persay, but since the rest of the show was more mundane and dramatic, any actual thrills seemed to come from the combat). The only other part I could really see as thrilling would be the intrigue stuff around Gendo. Anyway, my point is that I think ApW hacks are at their best when they are NOT giving equal treatment to all the things we can do in RPGs. I look over at Monsterhearts, which is a stellar game in my opinion, and see that it very obviously isn't paying equal attention to talking-stuff and combat-stuff; you have 3 (maybe 4) talky-moves and 1 (maybe 2) fighty-moves, and the game is better for it because the genre it's emulating is more about the talking than the combat. If the stories Killy wants to tell are primarily the combat stories of the Evangelions, if that's what the game is trying to model, being less-focused on the talky-stuff is a better choice to me.

Do you think that the stress and stress critical effects from combat directly effecting the health of character relationships isn't enough at this point? You are suggesting that I include a stress system that has in-game mechanical effects when I had two, a combat and a social, the former sometimes feeding the latter.<br/><br/>Combat, to me, was the most thrilling, but also the most important for the characters' relationships. Shinji can't function socially, and is only able to express himself through action (or inaction), the majority of which occurs while in his Evangelion. Asuka is a one-track record the majority of the time, and only changes her tune after or during a major sortie. Rei just... is Rei. She, like Asuka, only performs major character changing or defining actions during or after sortie.<br/><br/>The slice-of-life of Evangelion is the building of tension. Nothing is happening, and the reason it isn't boring is because you know that something <i>will</i> happen, and it will be a battle against an Angel, and the characters might die. It's not that the slice-of-life stuff is intrinsically interesting - it is only interesting as a dichotomy of emotional tension against the combat, and would be nothing without it. <i>That</i> is why I have put the majority of the rules' weight onto combat, rather than kids being unable to communicate with one another. Because really, almost nothing happens unless there's an Eva involved.<br/><br/>To elaborate on your idea, <blockquote>"...some kind of stress counter that effects you. Gives certain moves, bonuses and negatives..... Would fit in greatly and a unique feature" </blockquote> here, the reason I'm not granting bonuses and moves for Strain is that it would incentivize specific actions in relationships, rather than free play. The function of Strain at this point is to force change, not to enforce specific behaviors. Too much Strain, and you do <i>something</i> based on the relationship you already have, not a specific thing based on your chosen moves or background.<br/><br/>The effects of Strain build and grow worse over time, as the more Strain you hold and are forced to release, the more you hurt (purposefully or inadvertently) the people around you, which means your Strain-release actions the next time will be worse, because your relationship is worse. That is combined with the Hedgehog's Dilemma, in which the only way to release Strain is to roll a reversed-value Nerve move. Because Nerve is the 'defensive' stat for combat and social conflict, you are hard-pressed socially with Strain if you are cool and aloof, or more endangered in combat if you are gentle and open-hearted and have better relationships.<br/><br/>Is this something like what you had envisioned? At this point I'm pretty happy with it, so I hope you are as well (or at least thing it functions well).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/JasonT">@JasonT</a>, I think Profiles is a fantastic replacement name, thank you. I'll use that right away. Do you want your handle in the contributors' section?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, I do have <i>Bliss Stage</i>, and while I like it for the simplicity of form, I find it too nebulous for Evangelion specifically. The television show and movies have many canonical tools and events that have explicit effects on other portions of the show. For example, AT Fields, and how they interact with one another, and the environment, as well as Synchronization Ratio levels; "She's past 100%! Unit-02 has gone berserk!" is a literal event that occurs, cause and effect, and I want to be able to render those scenes in a satisfying manner.<br/><br/>The more compartmentalized Stress/Trauma/Trust mechanics of relationships in Bliss Stage are neat, but I don't know if I should (or want to) pull that idea over to NSE.<br/><br/>And <a href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">@J_Walton</a>, <i>Bliss Stage</i> is totally about sex! You crazy guy, you. <blockquote>" It\u2019s a given that the kids are touching, playing with, and discovering one another, and practically a given that the adult has broken down by now. The hot-house atmosphere and flatly screwed-up circumstances twist all the emotions and roles into strange forms, all of which should be recognized as the real story components addressed in play.<br/>Conceivably, it could be played with no sex [...] but who could believe that would happen?"</blockquote> SEXY TEENAGE TIMES OF THE PORT BOW. <br/>(Just teasing, btw, I know it's terrific)<br/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">@horn_head_o</a>, scale is tough. I will probably be able to call it out with some of the cues in Magi (GM) moves, but without intensive rules design for crushing cars, etc., underfoot, I'm not sure how to have that rendered in-game.

I'm just providing another mirror to that feedback, another person's rationale for the same point. Not meaning to belittle your points or stamp out your opinion (or the devil's advocate opinion even), just furtherin' discussion.<br/><br/>Scale is indeed tough to do beyond just flavor! I'm sure there are other games out there that reinforce scale/power, but the big one that comes to mind for me is Mythender. A lot of that game is in description, but one thing it does is throw around a million physical tokens/dice. Like, you need literally over a hundred dice to make that game run. I think that by doing it physically it gives even the player this sense that you are truly powerful. <br/>Throwing around a million tokens doesn't do much good to an ApW design, but maybe that idea of keeping stuff BIG can ramp up the scale. Make the numbers big (but still balanced), suggest playing at a big table, use large dice (size, not sides), whatever. Enforce a feeling of scale in the way you present the game maybe instead of necessarily putting it in the rules.<br/>I dunno, I'm just throwin' around ideas, scale is a tough thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Killy" title="Killy"><img alt="Killy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/669/nBHMHULXQGKOR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Killy">Killy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416225/#Comment_416225" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T17:34:56+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  5:34PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2013 5:38PM by Killy.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the ways I've considered scale is the hacking of the Collateral Damage mechanic from <i>Adeptus Evangelion</i>.

Collateral damage is a great way to show that they're huge and leave destruction in their wake, but I agree about the purely punitive nature of that. It would be a great thing IN CONJUNCTION with other stuff. <br/><br/>I'm on my phone so I'm not lookin' at the doc right now, but can you up other numbers (damage etc) while leaving the general 2d6 alone? If you're up for a challenge you can spend some time doing probabilities and make it more dice (or different dice) but that's probably not a great idea.<br/>Again with the presentation, you can say the game should have 4 d6s, two small (for human actions) and two big ones (for Eva actions). Presentation isn't so solid that it will always work, but it can be a great way to enhance the feel without being intrusive to your game's actual design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416229/#Comment_416229" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T18:05:47+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  6:05PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I got a chance to read the doc and really liked what I saw.

The 2d6 base just provides the result curve across the bottom. In this example, all move result values would be increased by 10.<br/><br/>Changing the dice' size-value, such as d8's or d12's, would increase the result curve spread, offering more roll-result granularity. I could have instead of 3 degrees of result (fail, hit-with-cost, hit) maybe 4 or 5, with hit-with-cost in the mathematical middle-ground. It would also bias the rolls more heavily towards the middle result, in this case "hit-with-cost". This would be good if I wanted more things with more effects and more sub-rules and resultant cause-effect chains, but that's not really the sort of game I want this to be. The more quickly it can play, while still modeling canonical Evangelion cause-effect events, the better.<br/><br/>Physical size difference is a good idea - especially with the damage dice. Rolling up to 8 or 9 big d6's across a table would be pretty fun, and a good comparative scale against miniaturized pilot dice.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/zircher">@zircher</a> - <i>Canon is King</i> is the goal of not projecting my own ideas of what Evangelion should be any more than absolutely necessary. I've tried not to include anything more than what was included in the original series and films to try and cut down on it becoming 'my game' more than 'a game'. Plot, gender, and how you enact your abilities is entirely up to the players, and the personality stuff presented in backgrounds is hopefully light enough to allow creativity while still producing an archetypal character.<br/><br/>Angels will be entirely the Magi's prerogative, though I will probably include some sample Angels from the series, modeled and represented in text like a monster in DW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416247/#Comment_416247" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T21:29:43+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  9:29PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2013 9:30PM by JasonT.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/JasonT">@JasonT</a>, I think Profiles is a fantastic replacement name, thank you.

Like you said, straight up numerical inflation while keeping the relations between the numbers (like, say, adding 100 to everything) the same could also give that "big" feel.<br/><br/>I 100% agree that the SoL stuff isn't just a side-show to the combat. It's an important thing to the show, and I personally find that it was actually more important. Here's how I kinda interpreted it in the show: Their relationships were changed during the combats when they were under serious pressure, but the ramifications and fallout of those changes was most witnessed once they were back in their lives. The ramifications of the changed relationships were one of three things that kept bringing me back to the show (the others were seeing what the other Angels were like and, later on, the progression of Gendo's plans).<br/>In fact, I sorta feel that when characters tried to change their relationships outside the Evas it usually failed, like with Asuka's self-doubt or Shinji's relationship to his father.<br/>Jason is very correct that you don't NEED to do this, and that if you want to focus on the other aspects more, that's a fine way to write a game. It's worth considering though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Killy" title="Killy"><img alt="Killy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/669/nBHMHULXQGKOR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Killy">Killy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416258/#Comment_416258" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T00:48:47+00:00" title="June 14, 2013 12:48AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Their relationships were changed during the combats when they were under serious pressure, but the ramifications and fallout of those changes was most witnessed once they were back in their lives.</blockquote>\nTrying to do that with the Strain system - ideas?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416263/#Comment_416263" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T01:48:48+00:00" title="June 14, 2013  1:48AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2013 1:50AM by horn_head_o.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm... Go with me for a minute.<br/><br/>* Don't call it Strain, but Tension. Tension between characters can be either positive or negative (as characters grew closer as well as further as a result of the Evas) while Strain has a negative connotation. Tension can only be raised while in the Evas. Both positive and negative things increase tension. Have Tension rise when the paradigm set by one of your bonds with them is threatened.<br/>* Divorce Help/Hinder from a stat, switch it to +# of Bonds (as in DW). Whether the bonds are positive or negative, you still know them better and are better at helping/hindering.<br/>* As you have it, "Show Your True Feelings" is how you break Tension. But I'm not super-fond of how you have it at the moment - I'm not a big fan of "roll low" moves. Besides, Shinji (the weak-of-heart) was awful at showing his true feelings, while Asuka (lots of Nerve in that her) didn't have much trouble just blurtin' stuff out.<br/>Here's a different path. Show Your True Feelings uses +Tension - the greater the tension in the air between you, the more it wants to come bursting out (and with a max of +3 it's already set up to be used in rolls!). On high rolls, the truth is out, add or revise a Bond reflecting the new paradigm and lose all Tension toward them. On 7-9, the truth comes out kind of muddled and unclear, reduce Tension by one but the Bond is unchanged. 6-, hard move as usual.<br/>(interesting observation: the sort of folks who keep their true feeling bottled up and finally boil over, like Rei or Asuka, don't have a hard time getting that info out right, while Shinji tries all the time to express himself and as such it keeps coming out all messed up)<br/><br/>That means that as the truth comes out, you understand each other better and your relationship improves. Tension comes from relationships being <i>different</i>, not necessarily in distress, and those changes allow for character growth away from and toward each other while still generally improving your overall combat effectiveness. And you get a neat mechanical debate of "I want to be better with my teammates, I can build up tension to have a better shot at that or I can try a bunch of times at low tension with less of a chance,"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416283/#Comment_416283" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T10:28:00+00:00" title="June 14, 2013 10:28AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Killy, I did read the doc, but really like the way this doc is going with the tension ideas.

Feel free to bring up any other questions or comments at any time.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">@horn_head_o</a>, re: "go with me for a minute" -- consider yourself gone with!<br/><br/>First off, I do like Tension over Strain, so I'll likely change that. You mention "tension between characters can be either positive or negative" which at this point, is also true of the Strain system, which remains abstract until released. So, at this point, I'll refer to it as Tension.<br/><br/>Second, I'll tell you what I have so far more explicitly (because I feel like I'm not communicating it well on the doc):<br/>- A Bond system that is a descriptive sentence, and one or two adjective tags. <br/>- A Tension system that grows when you resist the <i>dominate</i> move, and when your allies go <i>stress critical</i> during combat.<br/>- At 3+ Tension over a Bond, the character must act in a manner that calls on that bond's tags, and do something that would have an intense emotional effect on the other character in the bond.<br/>- The action does not have to be positive or negative, but does have to stem from their current relationship's tags/description.<br/>- That, above, is called 'release', and will likely change the description and tags of their bond.<br/>- To lower Tension (and preserve the current bond/relationship), they must <i>show their true feelings</i>.<br/>- The <i>show your true feelings move</i> is a reversed Nerve roll, and does not have to be positive feelings.<br/><br/>So now let's get into your ideas (which are good, but I want to unpack a bit).\n<blockquote>"Have Tension rise when the paradigm set by one of your bonds with them is threatened."</blockquote> Hard to quantify - I'd have to stick that player-side rather than mechanically and have them manage their own Tension, which could easily lead to Tension err'wher! or no Tension at all. A neat idea with Tension coming from threats to the relationship, though. I might add another "take +1Tension" option from that kind of event.\n<blockquote>"Divorce Help/Hinder from a stat, switch it to +# of Bonds (as in DW). Whether the bonds are positive or negative, you still know them better and are better at helping/hindering."</blockquote> I considered this one for awhile when I was first drafting the basic moves. The standard of *World games is that you are better at effecting another when you know them well. However, in AW with Hx, sometimes you are better with them, and sometimes you are worse -- even if you've known them for years. That, I don't like. In DW, it is +# of bonds, though that means people who don't know each other aren't very good at helping one another, and that knowing another well means you are good at it -- which I also don't agree with, especially in the context of Evangelion. By the end <b>(Eva spoilers)</b>, Misato knows Shinji better than anyone else, and still she can't help him! Try as she might, in any way, she can't help him. In the end she uses her sexuality to try and spur him onward, but he just sits down at the bottom of the elevator and cries. In light of that, I divorced <i>Help/Hinder</i> from bonds specifically and left it directly to character-side stats, based on the fiction.<br/><br/>I <i>am</i> considering being able to 'exploit' your bond with another in order to take more Tension (or give it over!), but take +1forward to the H/H move. Thoughts on that?<br/><br/>Let's get into the <i>show your true feelings</i> move, because it is one of the biggest steps away from AW-style rules (I think). It is a reversed Nerve roll, which means that those who are better at protecting their feelings (Nerve is for <i>keeping it together</i> and <i>defy</i>, the self-defense moves) are less able to lower their defenses and get close to others - the core of the Hedgehog's Dilemma! <br/>True, Shinji is awful at showing his true feelings, but he is also pretty okay at keeping it all together. That's what he does, mostly, is just keep everything all bottled up inside. If he were less Nerve-vous (heh) he'd have been able to lower his defenses and, well, show his true feelings to others. Instead he keeps it all inside, protecting his own heart.\n<blockquote>"Show Your True Feelings uses +Tension - the greater the tension in the air between you, the more it wants to come bursting out (and with a max of +3 it's already set up to be used in rolls!). On high rolls, the truth is out, add or revise a Bond reflecting the new paradigm and lose all Tension toward them. On 7-9, the truth comes out kind of muddled and unclear, reduce Tension by one but the Bond is unchanged. 6-, hard move as usual."</blockquote> This one feels a lot like more classic AW-style +Hx stuff, where it rolls over 3 and back down to 0 or 1 periodically. <br/><br/>This is interesting - it's essentially the opposite of mine. In this, you use Tension to change your relationship purposefully, after the intention of doing so (as a player). It also brings in the GM for the hard move on a failure. Overall, it's easier on the characters, and has an optimistic bent. It also only has no risk other than 'more plot' with the GM hard move - something that is considered 'good story-game design', but might be too forgiving for such a socially challenging theme/show/canon.<br/><br/>In mine, the Tension forces change ontp the characters, and they can only attempt to stop it - they have no choice but to be changed by what happens around them. Furthermore, the reverse Nerve forces a difficult choice onto the players, which happens to be one of my Principles, "create interesting dilemmas"; you can have a high-Nerve character, who can protect themselves and be lonely, or a low-Nerve character, who is often hurt (mentally, socially, or physically), but has better relationships.<br/><br/><b>In summary,</b> I like your ideas, and they're classic AW-style stuff, with aspects I will incorporate, but I think they are too forgiving, and very, very optimistically minded. It seems like they're built to fix relationships, rather than model crumbling or unstable relationships.<br/><br/>If you think I'm wrong, though, fire away! Glad to be discussing this with you.<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and here's where I got the idea for reverse-roll moves: <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=5951.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=5951.0</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416336/#Comment_416336" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-15T02:38:50+00:00" title="June 15, 2013  2:38AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2013 2:44AM by horn_head_o.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps that's true - I definitely lean toward leaving the players in control, rather than having the system be constantly pushing change upon them and the players having to resist against that flow. I mostly lean this direction because I think that anyone playing an Evangelion game is going to strive to push those relationships and change relationships. That way if care about the other aspects of Evangelion and want to focus on them you can do them and not be bothered really, but you can totally do all the tension and changing relationships things. I'm just not really into the system telling railing me into doing things without having failed rolls to warrant it.<br/>And yeah, I have a little more of an optimistic view, that's true.<br/><br/>Hit some individual points:\n<blockquote>Hard to quantify - I'd have to stick that player-side rather than mechanically and have them manage their own Tension, which could easily lead to Tension err'wher! or no Tension at all.

If I worded it as such:<br/>"<b>When you act contrary to your bonds with someone,</b> increase your Tension with them by 1."<br/>Doesn't seem so out-there or arbitrary.

I've never been super-satisfied with the "you're on, like, a new tier of knowing them, but mechanically it's nothing" thing that ApW pulls, and so when I was writing my Honor system for Avatar World I changed it. My way was that fulfilling oaths (gaining trust) raised your Honor to a maximum of +3, and whenever it's +3 you have the choice to drop to +1 to get the XP from it (you're being selfish, you won't be able to help them as well so you can have personal gain, so they'd trust you less and you need to build it back up again). That doesn't quite work perfectly for you, but since you had a problem with this ideas as well I wanted to mention it in case it inspires.\n<blockquote>In DW, it is +# of bonds, though that means people who don't know each other aren't very good at helping one another, and that knowing another well means you are good at it -- which I also don't agree with, especially in the context of Evangelion.</blockquote>\nThis is a good point. I still kinda agree with the idea that yeah, knowing each other better did increase their combat effectiveness on the whole, but it didn't make them better at helping each other as people. However, I'm hesitant to just do it with relevant stats. Without it, I feel that Bonds aren't really integrated mechanically very much (if at all) and mostly just serve as narrative indicators. Additionally, even if knowing each other better (which isn't quite what Bonds mean, Bonds are more about having experienced things together rather than knowing them, though your thematic point about NGE is the same) doesn't make much thematic sense, it does nice things within the mechanics, encouraging characters to shake up their relationships because in the long run it makes them more effective at helping each other.<br/>As for the specific example, I don't have a particularly strong rebuttal for that. The closest I've got is that, well, she busted the roll. It happens, even with a +3, and while I don't have specific evidence I feel like in general, being connected to people let them be better at helping them. Maybe I wasn't paying a ton of attention though.\n<blockquote>This is interesting - it's essentially the opposite of mine.

And generally, I'm not really seeing it being that much easier on the players - yeah, it lacks some Forward stuff, but I've generally found while doing my own design that I really really don't like Forward being thrown around much. It only has a very short-term impact, and while yeah, it affects the roll, it doesn't do that much overall. And there's no reason that my version couldn't do stuff too! I didn't include anything, but it was also just a draft written as I was posting, it could be developed into something more nuanced.<br/>As for 6-s, oh goodness, the GM hard move is often a hell of a lot more than 'more plot.' Remember that you can separate, take their stuff, even straight up hurt them for it. Never make the mistake of underestimating the danger of those Hard Moves - in fact, Hard Moves are often a heck of a lot more vicious than just raised Tension.<br/><br/>Cool stuff! Definitely enjoying this discussion.<br/><br/>EDIT: Mike in that BFA thread mentioned how the Angel in Monsterhearts has a continuum thing going on, and personally I'm much more satisfied by that handling rather than reverse-rolls (note: I dislike almost all reverse-rolls where rolling lowing is good, I even play ApW without the Harm move).

I acknowledge I'm taking a path with this that mechanizes some aspects of roleplaying, though hopefully I am also leaving space for interpretation of the required actions. The release doesn't have to be bad, just intense. I've revised the prose of the 'release of Tension' section to show this more clearly, I hope. Having change be the standard, rather than preservation, means that characters will have to actively work to preserve the relationships they desire or enjoy. It's harder to hold onto what you love than to let it all just go on by (even if those things hurt you). <br/><br/>Specifically in reply to your optimism, the Tension/release cycle, now that I've included your suggestion below ("Act contrary to bonds..."), allows characters to force their own changes as well, or accelerate the changes occurring, so that they can create a different relationship as well. However, they'll have to work to preserve it, once they have gotten what they want.\n<blockquote>It IS hard to quantify, but I think that that's often okay in *-World games.

I think I've mentioned this before? Or dej\xe1 vu? Whatever. Player-siding between two good choices is great, much like the roll-to-hold moves.\n<blockquote><blockquote>In DW, it is +# of bonds, though that means people who don't know each other aren't very good at helping one another, and that knowing another well means you are good at it -- which I also don't agree with, especially in the context of Evangelion.</blockquote>\n I feel that Bonds aren't really integrated mechanically very much (if at all) and mostly just serve as narrative indicators. Additionally, even if knowing each other better ... doesn't make much thematic sense, it does nice things within the mechanics, encouraging characters to shake up their relationships because in the long run it makes them more effective at helping each other.</blockquote>\nYeah, I haven't integrated bonds at this point other than narrative cues for Tension and release. Because they have aspects on them... I could place a mechanical value on aspects themselves, so that you roll to help with positive aspects, and roll to hinder with negative aspects - you can help someone more easily the more you like them, I suppose. Just a quick idea; "When you help someone, roll+ aspects on your bond with them that have positive connotations. When you hinder someone, roll+ aspects on your bond with them that have negative connotations." That way I can integrate the bonds/aspects more closely into the rest of the moves without losing their narrative cues, or doing the (strange) Bond#/Hx rollover thing.\n<blockquote><blockquote>blah blah blah player-facing Killy-said stuff</blockquote>\n... I've generally found while doing my own design that I really really don't like Forward being thrown around much. It only has a very short-term impact, and while yeah, it affects the roll, it doesn't do that much overall. And there's no reason that my version couldn't do stuff too! I didn't include anything, but it was also just a draft written as I was posting, it could be developed into something more nuanced.<br/>As for 6-s, oh goodness, the GM hard move is often a hell of a lot more than 'more plot.' Remember that you can separate, take their stuff, even straight up hurt them for it. Never make the mistake of underestimating the danger of those Hard Moves - in fact, Hard Moves are often a heck of a lot more vicious than just raised Tension.</blockquote>\nMhm, I realize that Hard Moves are a lot harder (heh) than just raised tension, but I'm worried that introducing the GM as the antagonist in the realm of relationships muddies the waters there - I'd rather have all of the player-character relationship stuff be player-sided. Perhaps an optional "... or Magi makes a move" addition for those times when the players "the players look at you expectantly".\n<blockquote>Cool stuff! Definitely enjoying this discussion.</blockquote>\nMe too, thanks for taking the time!\n<blockquote>Have you seen/considered the Angel's sort of continuum?</blockquote>\nI have, but it has different math than the strict reversal. In the MH Angel skin, having one side of the continuum at +2 means the other is a -2. In an absolute reversal, -1 to +3 switch their result likelihoods on the 6-/7-9/10+ hits.<br/><br/>Having an continuum would be interesting for some other 'either/or' option system, like the MH Angel's <i>Profane</i> and <i>Grace</i> moves. I think a system like that would encourage more of a binary play choice than the reversal.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416389/#Comment_416389" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-15T21:20:33+00:00" title="June 15, 2013  9:20PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> allows characters to force their own changes as well, or accelerate the changes occurring, so that they can create a different relationship as well.

I don't think it's that problematic to put the GM in there, but that's a good reasoning for it. Maybe try it out that way in a couple sessions and see if really does mess with the theme.<br/>I don't think you need the extra clause though in that case. The GM already just makes a move when the players look at you expectantly, no need to just reiterate it.\n<blockquote>I have, but it has different math than the strict reversal.

The valuation of aspects on bonds, but I'd have to create a cost/worth subsystem based on the -1/+3 spread, and, just... <b>ugh.</b> No.<br/><br/>2. Assign stats to bonds, as an archetype of how you relate to that person. The four stats at this point are most basically mental/emotional states rather than other features, so that is a good possibility. You could assign a stat to your bond, or perhaps two, and then you must use one of those two when you Help/Hinder, and when you Tension-release, and lose bond aspects altogether? Looser, freer play for that, and it has the dual use of mechanizing bonds with Help/Hinder.<br/><br/>3. Have to evoke an aspect of your bond with that person to help them, in the fiction, while at the same time the fiction informs which stat they use. Obviously, some stats are unfitting for some relationships, so you'll get non-optimal situations for Help/Hinder, but mostly it will fine - which I think happens anyway, when people Help/Hinder one another.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Killy" title="Killy"><img alt="Killy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/669/nBHMHULXQGKOR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Killy">Killy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416565/#Comment_416565" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-18T04:57:44+00:00" title="June 18, 2013  4:57AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2013 4:59AM by Killy.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Help/Hinder has been revised to the following:\n<blockquote>When you assist or interfere with another on a roll, say how you do so and roll+ bond stat, whichever of the two is appropriate to your action.  On a hit, they take +1 (help) or -2 (interfere) to that roll. When helping, you may instead choose to calm them down by rolling +Contact, healing a stress critical box. On a 7-9, you also expose yourself to fire, danger, retribution, or cost.</blockquote>\nContact is still used when <i>calming them down</i> because it takes empathy to help another when they are in a place of terror or rage, and merely knowing them well is not enough. Other situations, I've gone with the *World idea of bonds affecting your help/hinder rolls.<br/><br/>Bonds have been revised slightly as well.\n<blockquote>When you create your character, you also create a bonds between them and each of the other characters. Following that, assign two stats to each bond that represent the nature of your relationship.<br/><br/>When you act contrary to your bond with someone, you hold +1 Tension over your bond with them.<br/><br/>When you defy someone\u2019s attempt to dominate you, you hold +1 Tension over your bond with them.<br/><br/>When someone goes stress critical and triggers you rejection, you hold +1 Tension over your bond with them.<br/><br/>You can only hold three Tension over a bond with another before you must release it. When you release Tension, you must evoke one of the stats on your bond with them and one of their personal aspects in the fiction of your action. Additionally, you must release it in a way that shows the anxiety your character has accrued by holding so much Tension, somehow upsetting or strongly impacting the subject of your release. ...<br/><br/>... Upon the release of Tension, both characters must change one of the stats they have assigned to their bond, or revise the nature of their bond entirely. The character who released tension removes all held Tension over that bond, starting at zero again.</blockquote>\nAt this point, I have no listed effect on the target (victim?) of a Tension-release, though I have some ideas. Target of tension-release... <br/>... does nothing except revise bond<br/>... tries to <i>keep it together</i> in the face of their distress<br/>... holds +1 Tension over their bond with the releaser. <br/><br/>The first is fairly soft, I think, and the second perhaps too hard. The third is almost right, but it could easily trigger a counter-release... which I think would be cool, but perhaps too much? Perhaps the first release-target can have a few options to choose from. <br/><br/>Now that I've removed <i>aspects</i> from bonds, should I also remove them from characters entirely? They are mostly there as cues for Tension-release, so now that they don't affect it, there may be no reason to include them at all.

Here's a simple idea: some personality types (aspects) lend themselves better to some Profiles than others. Why not put the Aspects as the new version of the "look" from ApW? Include looks as well, even if in NGE weren't too important generally, and you'll have a tiny section of each profile that leads to some customization and more infusion of the desired sort of flavor for each profile (while overall reinforcing the personalities present in NGE!). If you feel uncomfortable locking players into the lists, add a clause so they can write their own if desired, but still include suggestions.

It's been about 4 months since my last appearance here, and in that time I've been very busy, but unfortunately not with game design until only the last few weeks. However, I am back with some new ideas and material for you and I. If you're interested, feel free to stay awhile and talk.<br/><br/>There was some play-testing done over the summer months,  many notes were taken, and the findings were that the Tension system is too much and too little at once; lots of record-keeping and action reinforcement for little narrative benefit. For the last session we switched out the Tension mechanics for a hackjob of Strings from <i>Monsterhearts</i> which worked fairly well, but perhaps had more tendency for fuckwithery than we were looking for. Lately, I've been considering a dualistic model of Strings/Tension, wherein they can be used to assist others while in combat and function as the standard 'social power' outside of the Evangelion. The closer you are, the better you fight, but the more easily you hurt one another.<br/><br/>To answer that question, I've come to you again for advice; how could I best model the relationships of this genre, wherein close relationships help within combat but may backfire in civilian life? <br/><br/>There have also been some changes to the Basic Moves, Backgrounds, and Personnel Profiles, but those are hinged upon the relationship mechanic, and so they'll remain shrouded for now.

These things are not all the same thing.</b><br/><br/>You have bonds, with Tension upon them; Tension is limitless; you get it between characters; Tension can be spent to help in combat; spent to hinder in civilian; spent to manipulate towards certain actions by negative reinforcement in both; hold Tension over the bond; bond is defined (list of strict definitions?); change nature/definition of bond is to take stress (just as combat stress or fear stress); stress can only be removed when helped in-combat, after stress critical; stress-critical can give Tension to bond, therefore more fuckery in civilian life; go against your bond is to take stress; must change nature of bond if [something happens], or try to preserve it; something about preservation of bond or changing of bond; lots of Tension means help in-combat, hinder in-civilian; Tension comes from trying to change bond, or trying to avoid pain; must include emotional pain avoidance, and what weaknesses there are.<br/><br/>Therefor you have two characters with Tension between them (shared? separate?). They can spend that Tension to help one another if fighting (+1 forward/grit/tough/avoid stress/etc), or spend it to manipulate/hurt one another in civilian life. The bond they have defines how they can use their Tension. If they want to change their bond, they must roll+Tension (in a reverse roll); 10+ both take Stress and it changes; 7-9, roller takes Stress and it changes; 6- it changes and they may remove Tension. Reinforces low Tension, so they are far apart from one another, safe in civilian and apart in combat. <br/><br/><i>Should there be a nature to the bond? </i>Why not just Tension/Strings? When characters are working perfectly together in combat (Dance like you want to win!) they cannot bear to even touch or comfort one another ("this is the wall of Jericho!"). How does this relate to Eva? There's the AT field thing - absolute terror field? - the barrier of the soul, no one one can reach past it, the fear of pain, of closeness, the Hedgehog's Dilemma: perhaps this is not about Tension and Strings, but about barriers and distance. Use your barrier to help them survive, and break through it to help them be happy? One makes the other difficult, and they shift and change over time.<br/><br/>When you have a high Field/Barrier/Tension/Spirit (high spirits?) with another, you can save their life. Help them in combat. But you cannot help them be happy. You're too far away, too close by, too afraid of changing what good you have, or letting yourself be vulnerable to them. How do you portray this? Some sort of move - something triggered by fiction; yours or another's? When the Tension is high; when you <i>expose yourself</i>, you risk being hurt, roll+Tension. On a 10+ you take stress (or give it) and must retreat or lash out. On a 7-9 you take stress (or give it) only, but stay. On a 6- you break through, and can drop Tension. <i>But there's always more Tension coming from combat stuff, especially stress! Which can also come from failing to remove Tension!</i><br/><br/>So now you have a shitty-relationship (relationshit?) spiral towards loneliness and awesome combat skills. Seems pretty Eva.<br/><br/>/end vomit<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Killy" title="Killy"><img alt="Killy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/669/nBHMHULXQGKOR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Killy">Killy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423327/#Comment_423327" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-24T06:22:25+00:00" title="October 24, 2013  6:22AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2013 7:04AM by Killy.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe somehow tie the the relationshit/barrier/Tension stuff to Synch Ratio and AT Field power...?

Logic would demand that the more apart you want to keep others, the stronger this barrier gets. But anime-plot-wise, it sadly becomes just another tool for stating how badass a character is, when it could be a powerful dramatic tool to make the less adapted characters suddenly more suited for defense, while actually revealing what a character may hide behind their apparent cheerful personality.

That's really interesting, and yeah, definitely a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>So how it gets tied together is dependent on what you're conveying, but I think they should totally be linked. Synergy between your mechanics is a good thing, and jumping off of existing systems might jump-start this whole Tension mechanic. And if that spiral toward loneliness and awesomeness in combat is something you're interested in doing, inverting the AT field mechanic could be neat (note: I'm not looking at the mechanic itself right now, just the theory).<br/>My only reservation is that while a spiral toward loneliness is very Eva, it's vital that there be some reason for the characters to <i>keep trying</i> for social interaction, as on a game level it can be very exhausting if the characters start isolating themselves. If not interacting can lead to combat power, that's not fun - but if interacting <i>poorly</i> leads to combat power, uh, sign me up!<br/>I'm pretty sure the latter was already where you were going, I just thought it was worth stating that explicitly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RedwoodR" title="RedwoodR"><img alt="RedwoodR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RedwoodR">RedwoodR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423334/#Comment_423334" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-24T10:49:12+00:00" title="October 24, 2013 10:49AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Well, plot-wise AT field stands for All terror field if I remember correctly, </blockquote>\nAbsolute Terror field.

It's a pervasive fan assumption that most just accept, including myself.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">@horn_head_o</a>, I totally grok your point of still rewarding the attempt to communicate with one another, despite the relationshit spiral that is bound to occur. I want to push the characters into collapsing orbits or wild spins, and have them dislike it, while at the same time the players be invest in pushing for that as well.<br/><br/>The threads of the game should all come together, and their ends extend to the moves. I <i>will</i> tie the Tension (should I change that word?) into Synch Ratio in some way - perhaps the maximum SR level you may reach is the same numerical value of your Tension? (oh, and adjust SR level #'s) Because high SR is so dangerous to the survival of the character, players would endeavor to reduce Tension. On the other hand, you can keep your high Tension and have good AT stuff, and be a good help in combat, but be at risk for having your arm torn off.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Killy" title="Killy"><img alt="Killy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/669/nBHMHULXQGKOR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Killy">Killy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424050/#Comment_424050" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-11T04:35:32+00:00" title="November 11, 2013  4:35AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2013 4:38AM by Killy.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Today's 'while brainstorming' thought; editing and adding to make the basic rules setting-agnostic, but hold to the drama+giant robots themes.

That said, I'd 100% support going setting-agnostic still. Just means I'd probably play in a mostly Eva-flavored setting. I'd probably do that regardless - I'm unfamiliar with much of the rest of the genre, so Eva is pretty much all I know.<br/>So go for it, maybe I'll learn something new about the genre in the process <img alt=":3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":3"/>!<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh yeah, also, yes I would absolutely love to have this as an actual thing at some point.
