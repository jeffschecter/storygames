The whole point of Sufficiently Advanced is that it deals with entire civilizations of people who have almost godlike powers, and what sorts of things they'd do, so it seemed like a good link to me.

And even if we could bridge that narrow divide--less than a finger's width--we'd touch merely a fingertip (neither are reaching to grasp or embrace, no?).<br/><br/>But looking more closely... there does seem to be a lack of urgency--Adam could strain, could raise off his elbow. But is that "can't be bothered" (Brit for "apathy" if I recall correctly) or is it human frailty? Adam certainly isn't looking at God in a lackadaisical manner. Amused, maybe. Lovingly, possibly. Apathetic, unconcerned...? Not in the face, not to my eyes. I'd need more than a languid pose and limp finger to ascribe apathy rather than, say, weakness. Although it *is* interesting to ponder the hand angles of each in addition to the relative strain: God's is opened outwards, almost upturned, and straining; while Adam's is palm-down and languid. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about body language and gesture language during the Renaissance to make a definite call on the import of all this (there was *extensive* conscious and unconscious gestural languages in the courts of that time!).<br/><br/>OK, back to praise for the cool banner ad (which I like a LOT!), if the Colin doesn't want this thread to become a "rambler."<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112416/#Comment_112416" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T13:06:44+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  1:06PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It looks really nice man, good work!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112562/#Comment_112562" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T17:14:10+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  5:14PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/SA_Banner-Mini.jpg"/><br/><br/>Mini version.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112788/#Comment_112788" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T12:06:13+00:00" title="December  7, 2007 12:06PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RE the mini version (if I may): If at all possible, I'd stick with using the same title font that you use on the book cover and your web site (and the big banner, ya?). For me, type is just as valuable for recognition and evoking a tone as anything in the background; don't treat it like it can be trivially swapped out if it become unwieldy in some circumstances. If the original font is too wide (or has too-thin strokes, at smaller scales) then I'd try to bring it into a Multiple Master font editor and tweak it to make a a "Narrow" or "Demi" version which still retains the character of the original font.<br/><br/>But that's just me... it's still very smart and evocative.
