                    By uncodified here, I mean the assumptions (explicit or implicit) used in your gaming group to guide play but which are not part of the mechanical rules of the game or games being played.  <br/><br/>I'll talk through some for my current group, in doing so I will try to note where they are explicit and where they are implict (in which case of course others in the group might or might not agree with my assessment).<br/><br/>Also, the reasons for the rule and the effect matter.<br/><br/>Ok.  In no particular order:<br/><br/>1.  Dice fall where they may, explicit.  We don't fudge, we select systems in part for particular effects and then live or die by the results we obtain.  This is partly to give a sense of fairness, partly to incentivise people to think through character actions and not to get lazy on the basis bad results will get fudged out anyway.  Generally, we tend to play historical games and as such the possibility of a fairly random undesirable outcome is a good thing as it emphasises setting and tone.  By contrast, with Space 1889 the rules are designed such that unless you intentionally created a frail character you cannot really get killed by accident, which tone-wise is what we want from a more pulpy game.<br/><br/>2.  We tend to prefer random chargen.  Reason, partly because it prompts character ideas we otherwise would not have had, partly because we care strongly about verisimilitude and have found that random characters often feel more real than designed ones as people in real life tend to make less sense than characters in fiction, partly because it's quite fun at the table to roll the dice and see what happens.  Note, this only works if you do not arrive at the table with a character concpept, random only works as intended if you come up with your concept after rolling the dice.  Fairly explicit this one.<br/><br/>3.  You can reroll your character if it's dull.  This is our rerolling rule, again it's explicit.  We don't reroll for crap characters, we don't reroll if one guy's character is worse than anyone else's.  Those are challenges to be overcome or things that will spark interest as you come up with reasons why this loser is present.  Nor do we reroll uber characters.  However, if a character is basically fairly average with no obvious hooks we tend to reroll, as the point of random chargen for us is primarily to spark ideas and an average character tends not to do that.<br/><br/>4.  The game rules are the physics of the game world.  Implicit.  A lot of folk seem to think this is necessarily true, which it isn't, but in our group this is how it tends to work.  We expect the rules to reflect outcomes that the characters would expect and choose games accordingly.  Again, this is a verisimilitude issue, it makes it harder to maintain verismilitude if players have to take decisions that are contrary to the perceived world of the characters in order to maintain genre.<br/><br/>5.  Food, each week one person buys food and drink for the group.  If you're teetotal, you still buy drink for those who do drink.  Wine and ale are common, food is whatever grabs your fancy.  Explicit, save the buying drinks anyway bit which is just very British and would not be something one would state.<br/><br/>More in a bit.  The point of the thread is hopefully for people to describe their uncodified rules and the rationale and effect of them, feel free to challenge or ask questions, I figure ours are different to many people's here.                </div>

                            Many rules in our group are the same as yours, but here we go:<br/>
<br/>
1. Each week a different person buys food and drink. The person decides and waht he's buying, but beer and coke are the usual regarding drinks. Food varies a lot. This is explicit, and we made the roster by alphabetic order.<br/>
<br/>
2. Dice fall where they may, always. I make most of the rolls in the open, and usually ask the players to make the perception rolls for their PCs. This is implicit, as I know that if I wanted to, I could do my rolls hidden with no one bothering about it. But we have ended liking more this way.<br/>
<br/>
3. We tend to value verisimilitude a lot. Rules are the world's physics (though they can be cinematic physics), and my players take decisions according to them. Gaming the system is good, as we choose systems we like. This is explicit: some of my players had strong prejudice against using the rules in an effective way, so we talked about that until finding a point that was comfortable to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
4. We don't care if the chargen is random or point-based or whatnot, but if the system is random, my players ask me to have the option of using a point-buy. Thus, when we play CoC I let them roll the PC, or distribute a certain amount of points. Curiously, they always end rolling the PC, but they like to have the option.<br/>
<br/>
5. We play if there are at least a 50% of the players. This is explicit. Also, we use a mailing list and a blog to discuss things of the game between sessions, and schedule the next game. We usually play on fixed days, so people have time to tell everyone if they can't make it the usual day and it needs to be changed.<br/>
<br/>
6. We usually play one game until we finish the story at hand. Usually, we don't play other things in between. We tend to go for mid to long games (usually 4+ months). This is implicit.<br/>
<br/>
7. Once in a while, we arrange a day to try boardgames and things like that, usually in between RPG campaigns.                        </div>

Jason sends out an e-mail confirming that the game is on and making food decisions a few days before the game.<br>

Every few months I get tired of this and pass it off to someone else.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Our Wednesday night group has a go/no-go rule which gets us to play instead of sitting around and hanging out.  (Not that there's anything wrong with either option.)  We gather around 6:30 and establish that 7:00 is our game time.  If we're still joking about movies or just having fun, we'll drop the RPG for the night and eventually pull out a boardgame later on in the evening.                        </div>

                            Recently we've started using a wiki to keep track of character sheets, session notes, NPCs, areas of interest in our setting, etc.  This has been absolutely invaluable, especially since we decided at the outset that because of scheduling and time constraints, while there were seven people taking part in the campaign, except in special circumstances no more than five people would be playing at any given time.  So the wiki has been crucial to keep the folks who didn't play the previous session up to date on what's going on.<br>
<br>
Several of the folks in our group have gotten into writing nifty content for the wiki, which is cool -- it allows us to flesh out aspects of the world and makes for some fun collaborative efforts.  We've ended up making a rule, though, that substantial new information needs to be run by the GM before it goes up on the web, so that he isn't in a position where he says something during the game and someone else says, "Nuh-uh, that's not how the goblin gangs are organized.  Didn't you see my post on the wiki?"  We've also made a rule that backstory, etc. isn't canon until it comes up during the actual game, which allows us to brainstorm about our characters through email and on the wiki without committing to something that maybe turns out not to be as awesome in the context of the game.                        </br></br></div>

                            These are implicit rules that we've come up with:<br><br>1. Players and GM all bring snacks and drinks.  Everybody shows up with a bag of chips and a six-pack or something.  Or homemade cookies.  Mmm, cookies.<br><br>2. During gameplay, all bad guys are decapitated after vanquishing, "just in case."<br><br>3. If it's unrealistic, but cool, it's probably going to work.  The craziest, most dangerous plans are typically most effective.<br><br>-- Rafael                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
