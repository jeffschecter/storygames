I don't think there can be one perfect form that works for everyone and every year; for that, there are too many unpredictable factors. We're usually between 15 and 20 people, so the addition or subtraction of one very active person can make a huge difference. Trends in our tiny gaming scene will affect things - has there recently been a competition, and lots of new games that everyone wants to try out? Or has some Cool New Indie Game received a lot of hype recently? Or has some local designer created something new especially for this con?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Stuff we've done in past years</b><br/>\nThis is what has usually happened - nearly all communication is done via the rollespill.net forum.<br/>\n- Sometime in early winter, I start asking people what dates are good for them. I've stopped making a big thing out of this, as the people who respond and get their favorite date don't necessarily show up anyway; now I pick a date that works for me and doesn't collide with other events.<br/>\n- I post a list of things I want to play. Again, recently I've stopped doing this; it seems I can't keep interest in a new game for more than five minutes, so what I want to play in December suddenly seems boring in February.<br/>\n- I get people to commit to running a game. This has varied a lot; some years I've asked people to commit, other years I've mostly been "come over and let's see what happens". The last approach doesn't really work all that well - that is, it requires a lot of luck.<br/>\n- Around January, I start asking who wants to come. Their names are posted in a separate forum thread. This is never binding, and there are no tickets sold or anything (the con is free). I usually expect about 15-25% of those on the list not to come for various reasons, and there's usually 5%-15% people who arrive even though they're not on the list.<br/>\n- When people arrive, they get "bed notes" - basically a piece of paper saying where they can sleep. You get this for doing something for HolmCon - making snacks, driving people around, running games etc. The past two years, this hasn't really been necessary, as there have been more beds available than before and people don't seem to expect comfy sleeping anyway.<br/>\n- The first year or two, there was no schedule or signing up for events. People would just play games in any order, stuff they brought or found at the con. This was nice enough, but people started asking me to put up some sort of schedule, and when I did, things seemed to run more smoothly; so we've continued doing that. People can sign up for a slot if they want, and it's first come, first serve.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Change</b><br/>\nThis year, I made one major change. Last year, I felt like HolmCon had become "just another con" - a place to hang out and play games you could find anywhere, with people you can find anywhere. (There are enough venues for just hanging out with gamers already - HolmCon isn't just about that; I want it to be about innovation, exploration, weirdness, quality.) The prerequisite for admission this year was that you had to actually run something - a game, a workshop, anything. And, to give a symbolic indicator that I wanted to raise things to a higher level, I had a "no T-shirt" rule. (Of course, everyone bent this rule as much as they could, but nobody broke it, which I'm happy about).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor HolmCon, this worked wonders. People came there with the expectation that they'd be contributing, and that other cool people would be contributing new and different stuff. Even with such a tiny con, there was the feeling that you had to choose between interesting events the whole time. It seems that people rose to the occasion and decided to put in some extra effort. One third of this year's con-goers were first-timers at HolmCon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea whether this would have worked from the start. Probably not, really. But now that a lot of people have been at HolmCon, and it's been around for some years, it's okay to tighten the concept, increase the momentum. Heighten the expectations a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's quite possible that we've now arrived at a basic form that will work for at least a few years; I don't feel the same need to change things as I did last year. It feels like we're past forming, storming and norming, and have arrived at the performing stage.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216832/#Comment_216832" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T04:45:55+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  4:45AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like the idea of increasing expectations, Matthijs.<br><br>At Camp Nerdly, one of the rules is that you must bring something prepped to run - a one-shot, a board game, a yoga class, something.

It is very well organized.<br><br>He gets GMs to commit to running games well in advance, and he gets people to commit to playing in them before the day of the con. He typically organizes an afternoon slot and an evening slot, and 2-3 games per slot, since that's how many rooms/tables he has. There's dinner in between and a movie and chat after the evening slot.<br><br><br><b>AdamCon</b><br><br>I run AdamCon, though I didn't do it this year, for reasons of time and other things. It's typically a weekend-long con starting Friday evening and lasting till Sunday night. Friday is usually low-key. There might be gaming, but it's ad hoc. Saturday is two slots with a break for dinner. Sunday is one or two slots.<br><br>People are expected to help keep things running. In the past, I haven't done as good a job as Jeff at pre-arranging GMs, so on one occasion, I had to strong-arm someone to run a game. Too often, I end up GMing in almost every slot. I do sign-up sheets each day and people just jump into games that sound interesting. Next time I host a con, I will get more commitment from GMs, and formalize the "pitch sessions" for players. I will also formalize "house rules" for helping to clean up and cook and all that. Too much, people show up and expect entertainment and don't help out (none of the Story Games people who attended acted like this, just my other friends). Matthijs' idea of asking everyone to run something (anything) is awesome, but I can't see how it'd work for my group. Many of my non-SG friends are tabletop gaming neophytes. I suppose they could be prepared to run a board game or party game, though.<br><br>I actually had the problem that some of the people were just coming to socialize like it was a normal party. Socializing is expected, but if they're not gaming <i>at all</i>, that's a problem, especially when they're expecting my wife to play hostess and continually converse with them. I eventually instituted a "you are here to play games" policy that required everyone to find a game to play in, more or less every slot. There is plenty of time for socializing at the con, outside the 3-4 weekend gaming slots.<br/><br/><br/><b>Praise for Matthijs</b><br/><br/>Wow... I love the idea of a con theme (innovation, weirdness, quality) and it's awesome that you raised the bar for your own event. Kudos to you.<br/><br/>Are most of your attendees pretty serious gamers? Because I suspect my neophyte gamer friends would roll their eyes at me making AdamCon "serious business."                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217016/#Comment_217016" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T13:13:15+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  1:13PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're all dedicated people.

It did not make much difference for me, as I have always been one for arranging things, but I sense that it probably played some part in making the con of this year one of the better ones.<br/><br/>To have a schedule is ok too, as it makes for a more "driven" weekend. The players don't want to loose out on the next game, so they tend to expect a closure of the game in due time. This means the fairly common "laisse faire" of rpg-gaming is arrested, in exchange with effective narratives which brings the game to some sort of closure. The overall effect of this is constructive. Games with a climax or closure is better, both for the players and for the playsmiths. I experience this as a good thing in all cons I have participated in, but at HolmCon it is doubly important, due to the participants being of a particular meandering kind of people, often trying out new concepts that leaves them with no regard for the time running out ... ;-)<br/><br/>But <i>HolmCon </i>is special. It has always been a con with something extra, mainly due to the signals about being there to "play the weird". This premise has made <i>HolmCon </i>into a melting pot for Norwegian game-design.
