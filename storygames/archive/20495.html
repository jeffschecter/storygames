From creating experiences for my players through the adventure, I started to focus on creating an experience for us all by emulating a certain feeling during the sessions. This changed on how I looked at game mechanics and what they should do in roleplaying games.<br/><br/>One thing that still amaze me is how Feng Shui were using the same skills but made them feel differently by having the player interpret the skill through the character's archetype. For example, a maverick cop used Martial Arts totally different than a ninja would.<br/><br/>Another thing that changed my world was letting the players do their own descriptions. I was brought up having the game master tell the players what influence the game mechanics had on the game world. Doing their own description, however, come with several advantages that I will cover in future posts in this thread.\n<h3>Matin\xe9 Was Born and So My New Design Philosophy</h3>\nOne major disadvantage in Feng Shui was that the description didn't really matter. If you used Martial Arts, you could as easily describe how you kicked someone to the moon or knocking someone out with a bat. The game didn't care about how you described it, so the descriptions were merely flavor.<br/><br/>I realized that, as I brought many of the design ideas from Feng Shui into my own game, so I had to think around this problem. How could I make the descriptions matter?<br/><br/>Other problems that occurred during playtest was that the characters were supposed to succeed with everything. If I threw them into a prison cell, then they could easily escape by just doing a few actions. In other words, obstacles for the characters were never obstacles for the <i>players</i>. Having them roll a plastic cube <i>never challenged them</i>.<br/><br/>I had to accept the idea, if I wanted them to succeed with everything, that I - as a game master - should be enjoyed by their creativity and the descriptions thereof instead of feeling the joy of having them struggle with my obstacles. This kind of implies that the game should create situations where the game master, or the other participants, could be surprised and amused by someone else's description.<br/><br/>I brought this up on the biggest Swedish roleplaying community around 2007, about this "new" way of playing and, mostly, enjoying roleplaying games. People started to discuss and come up with theories, one called \xbbbanana descriptions\xab based on my catch phrase example "Describe how you get passed the locked door using a banana". This spawned new games, and together we shared our experiences and insights.<br/> <br/>\n<h3>Examples of Games</h3>\n<a href="http://lookrobot.co.uk/doctor-magnethands/" rel="nofollow">Dr. Magnethands</a><br/>InSpectres<br/>Baron M\xfcnchhausen<br/>Once Upon a Time<br/>Rory's Story Cubes<br/>Psychodrame (French)<br/>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game 3<br/>While the World ends<br/><br/><i>Swedish Games</i><br/><a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/tip/" rel="nofollow">This is Pulp</a><br/>Matin\xe9<br/><a href="www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20439/dungeons-bananas-it-s-finally-here" rel="nofollow">Drakar och bananer</a><br/><a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13300.phtml" rel="nofollow">Supercrew</a><br/><a href="http://www.kaleidoskop.se/in-english/nostalgia/" rel="nofollow">Nostalgia</a><br/>Bl\xe4ck<br/><br/><i>NOT included</i><br/>Lady Blackbird - the game master is the one choosing what traits to be used (otherwise the game doesn't make any sense)<br/>Feng Shui - no real descriptive challenge because anything goes within each skill<br/>Wushu - anything goes so no real descriptive challenge here either.<br/><br/>The reasons why these aren't included will become more apparent in later posts.\n<h3>More Reading</h3>\n<a href="#Comment_450380" rel="nofollow">Traditional Games Doesn't Support Describing</a><br/><a href="#Comment_450454" rel="nofollow">Create a Gap Between Mechanics and Fiction</a><br/><a href="#Comment_450477" rel="nofollow">Intentions and Means, then Description</a><br/><a href="#Comment_450511" rel="nofollow">Keep Up the Flow</a><br/><a href="#Comment_450544" rel="nofollow">Build For That Flowing Conversation</a><br/><a href="#Comment_450663" rel="nofollow">The Next Step - Taking It To New Genres</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450376/#Comment_450376" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T11:36:48+00:00" title="January  6, 2016 11:36AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2016 11:37AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool topic!

It seems to me that nearly any RPG <i>could</i> get description-heavy, but if you want to build a system that encourages or demands it, "the roll depends on <i>exactly</i> what's going on fictionally" is one way to get there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450380/#Comment_450380" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T12:28:02+00:00" title="January  6, 2016 12:28PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2016 10:59AM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "<i>If you describe in detail before the roll, and you got 50% chance of failing, then 50% of all descriptions are of no use.</i>"\n<h3>Traditional Games Doesn't Support Describing</h3>\nThis post consist of short comments about how traditional games takes over the description, making the player <i>accept</i> rather than describe. These points probably wont make any sense now but they will in later posts.<br/><br/><i>The game master describes it all</i><br/>I think most groups play like this. Let them instead all narrate their actions to decrease the work load for the game master and increase the involvement for everyone.<br/><br/><i>Skills (or similar) are too descriptive</i><br/>If you are using Lockpick, then you already know what will happen. Imagine using a banana instead.<br/><br/><i>Mechanics supersedes descriptions</i><br/>If doing ten damage is what matters to a game system, then doing a description will do nothing but add flavor. Instead, use Scrabble letters as damage token where the participant only can do damage by using the letters in words to describe their actions.<br/><br/><i>Default state is failure</i><br/>When I was playing traditional game systems, I always told my players that they should describe what their characters were <i>trying</i> to do because the roll could cancel what they were about to do. Compare this to telling, after the roll, what the character is actually doing.<br/><br/><i>Each element in a game system takes time</i><br/>When the game mechanics takes too much time, for whatever reason, then people just want to move on - often by leaving out descriptions - to make the game flow better. I would suggest to think of the game system as a conversation, where one person responds to another through descriptions.<br/><br/><i>Players have to adopt to (descriptive) game mechanics</i><br/>Being prone gives someone -2, and you can only use Lockpick on doors. How about player wanting to give -2 to someone but it's up to the players to describe what actually happens?<br/><br/><i>XP (or other rewards) for descriptions</i><br/>If they don't want to do it, don't try to bribe them. Gather players wanting to play a descriptive-heavy game, by pitching the game to them in the right way, and let the interaction between them demand descriptions.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>You can probably smooth out these kinks in a typical roleplaying game, and many do, but doesn't it sounds better to, instead of patching something broken, make something work from the beginning? Do note, roleplaying games work perfectly in their own way but not if you want the players to be challenged in a creative way by making descriptions.

It's this exchange that gets players used to add detail to their descriptions. I even let them as far as adding things into the scene, as long as it's logical for them to be there.<br/><br/>Also, PbtA games taught me to get rid of the "Default state is failure" state of mind. Now I no longer ruin players description of their intent by negating it and replacing it with a description of how they fail miserably. What I do now is add to their description, which then turns into how they try something awesome, but then their opponents do something slightly better or just really lucky, or how something unpredictable makes the challenge harder. It's somewhat hard to get rid of this way of thinking but it certainly pays a lot.<br/><br/>I often wondered if games that use tags mechanics actually get the players doing better descriptions, but I've never played one. Well I used Aspects here and there but most I get is players pushing them as buttons to game the system, instead of good descriptions or actual roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450415/#Comment_450415" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T18:59:26+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  6:59PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "If you describe in detail before the roll, and you got 50% chance of failing, then 50% of all descriptions are of no use."<br/><br/>So, what about the description succeeds and the roll determines how many consequences you have to add?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3xJ" title="3xJ"><img alt="3xJ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3xJ">3xJ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450417/#Comment_450417" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T19:20:23+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  7:20PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2016 11:08AM by 3xJ.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a completely different approach than dice probability could be useful when only thinking about facilitating creative descriptions.<br/><br/>---<br/>Imagine a game.<br/>You are only allowed to describe your characters actions and the outer reactions of the immediate surroundings. <br/>You have different currency available to allow you to describe other things: like repercussions, distant areas, flashbacks, flash-forwards etc.<br/>In all other aspects, you are free to be creative. as such, you cannot just uproot the narrative with your descriptions, but you may move around to a certain degree.<br/><br/>You also gain this currency by asking others, for example "how do you open the lock with a banana." you are rewarded for challenging the creativity of others.<br/><br/>You also gain currency when your description causes a verbal outburst from any player (rewarding creativity and use of elements which pleases other members around the table.) This makes it so that the currently speaking player will try to conform to what the others like, making everyone engaged in acting and reacting. I know this could cause pre-planned reactions. In this case. The basis of this idea is a trait from "the burning wheel" - a trait called "unrelenting savagery."<br/><br/>The important snippet: <i>"when he uses this trait he must describe an act so horrid and vile it causes the other players to flinch and grimace."</i><br/><br/>Attaching different currencies to different reactions could be a thing.<br/><br/>But this is only if you want a game that completely works around the success-and-failure paradigm<br/>----<br/><br/>It's just an idea.<br/><br/>Edit: my grammar and structure was absolutely horrendous.

The result from this conversation is fiction, and fiction feed back into the conversation, at some point, so the conversation can move on. This is what happens when we play, and we could leave it at that by controlling the conversation through procedures (of how to talk to each other).<br/><br/>We could however expand this by introducing a pool of things to talk about.

If you want to create a game that makes the players describe their actions, create a gap between the mechanics and the fiction. Let the participants wonder what the mechanics really means.

I agree that's one way to focus the group's attention on a necessary description.  It's pretty excellent in that regard -- everyone sees the gap and is curious how it will be bridged.<br/><br/>I think the various techniques you've described go very nicely together -- let players succeed, putting the focus on <i>how</i> rather than <i>if</i>; put the description <i>after</i> the outcome, so it isn't provisional or abridged; create gaps that require non-obvious combos, interesting and surprising the whole table.<br/><br/>That's about as far as my agreement goes.  <br/><br/>As much as these techniques and systems aid in description, they also create a very specific play style.  They're good for free-wheeling creative improv and collaborative storytelling, but not so good for internal fictional causality, or in-character decision-making, or consequential strategy, or dramatic suspense, or most of the most popular traditional roleplay modes.<br/><br/>And, in my opinion, narrating your way to a predetermined fictional outcome doesn't "matter" any more than narrating your way to a predetermined mechanical outcome, regardless of whether the narration is obvious or non-obvious.  I am flexible on "mattering" -- often I am content to enjoy description purely for its own sake -- but when I do want description to "matter", that means wielding causal power (either to the mechanics or just straight back to the fiction).  <br/><br/>"Narrate how you pass an unlocked door with a banana" fails this test because before you start talking we know the end result is that the door is opened.  That's exactly my problem with roping in traits in Dogs in the Vineyard and Burning Wheel -- we know you want the extra dice, and we know you'll get them.  In both cases, the only question is how you'll justify the outcome.  And if we're content listening to that justification just for its own sake, then why would we be any less content to just listen to the Feng Shui cop player describe his martial arts moves?<br/><br/>I would enjoy playing in the style you've described (I have done stuff that's very close) as an occasional change of pace from more traditional styles.  I like variety!  However, I prefer that the quest for description-heavy play not limit itself to your style.  Personally, I'm more interested in taking that moment where the D&amp;D player is choosing the strategic option they think will win them the combat, and squeezing some quality description out of <i>that</i>.  And I think fiction that impacts mechanics (cloud -&gt; box) is <i>absolutely</i> an option to encourage this.<br/><br/>By far the most description-heavy roleplay I have ever engaged in is challenge-based play where the only way to overcome challenges is to illustrate to the GM through the fiction exactly what you're doing to maximize your chances of success.  Maybe the end result is a large bonus to a die roll, or maybe the end result is the GM says "yes, I agree that would work, so it does" -- either way, it's common to have a <i>lot</i> of description feed into that result.  Perhaps that's not the type of description that you like best, but it absolutely achieves the same state of intense group interest that your non-obvious gap-bridging does.  There's a gap in challenge-overcoming description too: the gap between the objective (victory) and how you're going to get there, using the constraints of your character's position and abilities.<br/><br/>Perhaps we actually agree on all this?  I inferred from your phrasing that you figured your way was <i>the</i> way to foster lots of description, but perhaps that's my mistake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450471/#Comment_450471" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-08T07:09:24+00:00" title="January  8, 2016  7:09AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2016 7:16AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/3xJ">@3xJ</a>, yeah, rewards for creative description are an interesting thing.  Some love 'em, some hate 'em.  When I use them, I am a big fan of tying the rewards to creative accomplishments or gifts to the group -- the person who invents the downside of your new item gets a reward token, for example.  Using those tokens to expand your narrative authority is a natural fit.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>, I love "How you do that?" too!  "Show us more" is another phrase I use -- I think it's formally in Archipelago, in addition to "try another way" and a few other techniques about the talking.  <br/><br/>As for incorporating overlap in GM/player narrative authority, yeah, that's tricky.  That example of rolling with a fully-described intent without invalidating it is a great one, though!  <br/><br/>As for tags, I have found them vulnerable to just what you describe with Aspects.  My guess is that the end result comes from other things, and that tags and aspects are neither inherently good nor inherently bad on the description front.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450473/#Comment_450473" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-08T08:40:18+00:00" title="January  8, 2016  8:40AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So this is the reason why it's good to not allow description of intent in Dungeons &amp; Bananas.

Everyone is going "Uhm, how the heck do you figure?" and then when the description comes after the roll, they're listening with interest. If you go "I'm going to build a little toy bird that will get the guards' attention and then spray them with potion, turning them into sheep" and THEN roll, people won't be as interested in your description.

Rolling damage is actually describing something in the fiction. If someone gets 0 hit points, that's a description of what happens.<br/><br/>Using game mechanics can be a mean that influences what the communication is about.<br/><br/>Imagine a conversation, like a discussion on a forum. A conversation must have a topic, and it can also have colliding opinions or different perspectives on the same thing. This comes from the participants, but we can also impose new things to talk about, or steer the conversation in a direction, by using game mechanics. If the use of game mechanics releases new uses of game mechanics, and each time this is done, it demands descriptions to make the usage feed into the fiction, you got a game system that creates fiction; you got a game system that forces the players to describe (to make sense of the game mechanics).<br/><br/>To achieve this, the description must come <i>after </i>the use of game mechanics. So what do we need to establish before that?\n<blockquote>Intentions + Means -&gt; Description</blockquote>\nThis was an old formula I came up with.<br/><br/>1. You need to tell the others your intention of the character's actions. <b>What do you want to achieve?</b><br/>2. You need to tell the others what game mechanics you use. <b>What tools do you want to use?</b><br/>--- go through using the game mechanics.<br/>3. You finally describe your action. <b>How do you achieve what you wanted with the tools you used?</b><br/><br/>Just with descriptions, it's not WHAT you want to accomplish that is important, it's HOW you achieve it. Just like you already know the ending in the movie American Beauty, where the interesting part is what leads up to that end. Baker writes something similar about <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/456" rel="nofollow">how to use Dogs in the Vineyard</a>. (Read up to the sentence "Dogs in the Vineyard's IIEE has teeth, it's self-enforcing.")<br/><br/>Can the fiction determine the intention? Yes. So fiction could be said to lead into the use of game mechanics. But it doesn't have to. The intention can come from somewhere else. Perhaps the participant just wants to take the "conversation" into a totally different direction just to see where it would lead?<br/><br/>So it's more about this (arrow = intention) ...<br/><img alt="image" src="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/descriptiveChallengeHeadToBox.jpg"/><br/>... than this ...<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/diceclouds/cloud-to-dice.jpg"/><br/><br/>... and the end result of the first picture is this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/descriptiveChallengeHeadToBoxToCloud.jpg"/><br/><br/>But I said that Intention + Means -&gt; Description was an old formula.<br/><br/>The new one removes Intention. You don't need it, unless for pedagogic reasons, and removing it will make the surprise of the description increase.<br/><br/>Further on, the intention can be obvious. All of the Swedish games that I listed in my OP creates a situation where the characters must fight to overcome a problem. The intention is then obvious and doesn't need to be said out loud.<br/><br/>EXAMPLE:<br/>We're playing This is Pulp. The enormous rebel ape king Kang have thrown you out of his zeppelin. This is a situation that the players need to describe their way out of. I'm going first, and declares my turn.<br/><br/>1. I want to blow up Kang's ship. (Intention)<br/>2. I want to use my move Blam, Blam, Blam. (Mean)<br/>3. [description]<br/><br/>But fighting Kang is obvious. The intention is already outspoken by the game master that set up the situation. So I could instead say: "I want to go. I use Blam, Blam, Blam", and then surprise everyone by how my character is blowing up the zeppelin.<br/><br/>So Intention is still there, but it doesn't need to be declared by the player.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I used Baker's images to explain my thoughts, but now I had to make some of my own. I changed the color of the arrows to make it more apparent which ones that are my images and which ones that are his.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450478/#Comment_450478" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-08T10:47:52+00:00" title="January  8, 2016 10:47AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's Complicated is a rather succinct example of this.

I can guess that different parts of the game have different constraints for each moment. Fun thing is, i can't quite picture how such a "moment mechanic" would map into the cloud relation. <br/><br/>So adding constraints in phases instead of "at every roll" can also be a way to create a certain type of story, the implicit reward being the dread and horror of the story you create, and the creative challenge coming from the constraints. And if my guesswork is right, as the constraints change, you will feel your creativity challenged in different ways. (Duh!). <br/><br/>PS: the quote is from the first thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450487/#Comment_450487" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-08T18:00:04+00:00" title="January  8, 2016  6:00PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2016 7:57PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm following this with interest, but so far I'm either in stark disagreement or completely missing the point. <br/><br/>My experience with this kind of design is the same as David_Berg's, above (and, it seems, aligns also with what Vincent was trying to illustrate with those diagrams in the first place).<br/><br/>Intention-&gt;Mechanics-&gt;Description (or the same, without Intention at all), in my experience, means that "Description" becomes entirely superfluous. Like you say, I can do if I already like to do it, but, otherwise, it's unnecessary. <br/><br/>If I'm playing Drakar Och Bananer, I roll the dice and I collect the stones. If I don't want to narrate, why should I? An unusual combination of Traits may strike the other players with curiosity ("Really? With a banana? Well, tell us, how did you do that?"), but if it's something more obvious (the enemy is a bunch of giant gorillas and I'm using my "Tommy gun" Trait and just blue dice), we may as well skip ahead and go to the next roll.<br/><br/>Does this mean that the game can only be played functionally with odd Traits and Items which do not relate to the theme or the challenges? Does it fail to function when the Traits/Items are well-suited to the challenge at hand?<br/><br/>Here is Rickard and Dave:\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>...often I am content to enjoy description purely for its own sake...</blockquote>\nYes, which makes you hard to talk about this with, because you will do it anyway no matter if the system forces you or not, or if you get a reward for it (from the system or other players [poodle points]) ...\n<blockquote>By far the most description-heavy roleplay I have ever engaged in is challenge-based play where the only way to overcome challenges is to illustrate to the GM through the fiction exactly what you're doing to maximize your chances of success.  Maybe the end result is a large bonus to a die roll, or maybe the end result is the GM says "yes, I agree that would work, so it does" -- either way, it's common to have a <i>lot</i> of description feed into that result.</blockquote>\n... as this paragraph clearly shows.<br/></blockquote>\nI can't understand whether you (Rickard) are saying that Dave is the type of player who "will do it [description] anyway", or whether Dave is the type of player who will do it only "if you get a reward from it". Aren't those two completely different things, maybe even opposite things?<br/><br/>What Dave is describing is challenge-based play with arbitrated mechanics based on the fiction (lots of right-facing arrows from the cloud to the dice, in Vincent's diagrams). In that kind of play you query the fiction to get as much detail as you can, and then you describe what you are doing in as much detail as the group will let you, because if you do not <i>you will likely be killed</i>, or at least fail to achieve your goal.<br/><br/>That's a very different kind of pressure than "narrating to impress your friends", and, as a player, you have no choice but to engage with it. (If you do not enjoy that, you will simply choose to play a different game.)<br/><br/>If you do not do this, you are, quite simply, a bad player and will likely lose the game.<br/><br/>How is the "banana technique", then, superior in "creating descriptive-heavy games"?<br/><br/>The only tools I've taken away from this thread so far are the design features listed by Dave earlier...\n<blockquote><br/>I also agree that slow game features (including slow mechanics) can cause groups to hurry past description; very precise game options (e.g. "pick lock") can render description superfluous; "this is just an attempt, it might not work" can truncate description; and bribery misses the point.</blockquote>\n...and the idea of creating a sense of curiosity in the other players by selecting entirely non-obvious mechanical choices. (Like "open the door with a banana" - everyone will naturally want to know how this happens, because it sounds odd.)<br/><br/>For what it's worth, my own favourite mechanical designs are those which take fictional description as input and then create fictional output, as well. There is a need to engage with the fiction, and to narrate descriptively, but also no "obvious" mechanical output, so we must go to the description to move the game along.<br/><br/>(A simple, but not terribly satisfying, example might be a rule like this: "One player describes a fictional situation. Two other players describe a possible outcome of that situation. We flip a coin to see which outcome comes about." A more sophisticated example might be a game where one player is a "bachelorette" who must choose between three suitors. Each suitor has a major problem or issue which could make them a bad match, and one is a murderer. Therefore, she will have to interact with them to find which is the best choice for her. "Tell me about yourself" because the character's priority as well as the player's.)<br/><br/><br/>Edit: Hopefully I don't sound too negative here.

Using different mechanics enhances one kind of fun over the others.<br/><br/>You see, describing how I "open the lock with a banana" is the kind of fun where we're supposed to entertain each other with our interpretation, and the real challenge is to make a logic connection of concepts on our description. The dice rolling isn't meant to be the challenge there, but instead a randomizer to help us/limit us on our descriptions for later in the game.<br/><br/>In trad games where the conflict is solved with the roll, the best use of the description is to add color and inform the fiction about how can it develop in the future at some point. At least, this works better if the GM isn't being deterministic about how the scene is going to unfold and builds future scenes based on the development of the current one. Also, works better when players take in consideration the descriptions offered by other players and build upon those.<br/><br/>Also in trad games and specially in Old School, the descriptions can be crucial to avoid dice rolling. It's usual in Old School games that the odds of solving the situation with a good roll are particularly low, thus optimizing descriptions is a great deal of the player's tactics to keep their characters alive.<br/><br/>Anyway, everywhere Descriptions are used, the intention is to make the result of the game (a.k.a the story) closer to the reference material in terms of quality. It isn't "we reduced the HP of the creature to 0", but "We fought the Dragon and though we started losing ground and almost died, in the end we managed to blast it with magic and stab it through it's throat!", yet the quality may be raised in several different forms; as many as different writers are there, have been and will be in the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450493/#Comment_450493" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-08T21:45:57+00:00" title="January  8, 2016  9:45PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2016 9:59PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a>, I'm more interested in having my input heard (and in understanding yours) than in winning, but I do kinda feel like your "this <i>is</i> the way to do it" is debate, especially following my example of a different way to do it.  So I may not be able to keep your "discuss/debate" distinction clear.  I will try, though!  If I veer too far off what you want, just let me know and I'll stop.<br/><br/>So, yes, you are 100% correct that I am the sort of player who will contribute and enjoy description in roleplay almost regardless of system.  I don't need anyone's rule set for that.  What I need rule sets for is to combine my love of description with social play.  I need system so that everyone <i>else</i> at the table is <i>also</i> providing the descriptions I enjoy, and <i>also</i> enjoying the descriptions that I narrate.  I have played plenty of sessions that did not achieve this, regardless of what I personally brought to the table.<br/><br/>Accordingly, I have plenty of experience pursuing system toward this end, and I can state without any doubt at all, and with decades of evidence, that the approach you've outlined in this thread is <i>not</i> the <i>only</i> way to elicit heavy description in roleplay.  Maybe it's the best one for your taste and the taste of the people you play with!  But it is not the best one for me (except when I'm in certain moods) and most of the people (well, at least half) I've played with.<br/><br/>I'm happy to explain how GM adjudication of detailed action attempts can foster description-heavy play if it wasn't clear from my first explanation and Paul's follow-up.  There are plenty of games that fall into the general "choose wisely to not die!" category of play which wind up rules-heavy or socializing-heavy rather than fiction-heavy, so the details here are important.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if the purpose of this thread is just to discuss your own system (which I do think is cool!), then I'll stop focusing on alternatives now, having said my piece.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450496/#Comment_450496" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-08T21:52:07+00:00" title="January  8, 2016  9:52PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2016 9:52PM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>On the other hand, if the purpose of this thread is just to discuss your own system (which I do think is cool!), then I'll stop now, having said my piece.</blockquote>\nCool, because I wrote: "Do note, roleplaying games work perfectly in their own way but not if you want the players to be challenged in a creative way by making descriptions.

The players land on an unknown planet.  They ask questions.  "Do we see any structures?  Any food sources?"  Whichever player is in charge of "technology" answers the first question, while the player in charge of "biology" answers the second.  (Vaguely like Archipelago, but in SiS the player roles are based on character roles, while in Archipelago they're purely player-level.)<br/><br/>So here's where the creative description challenge comes in:<br/><br/>The player who answers "Do we see any structures?" draws a random word from a pile of paper scraps which the players filled out before play.  Depending on the situation, the question, and their own inspiration, they may pick from the Nouns, Adjectives, and/or Verbs pile.  In the case of "Do we see any structures?" that's probably just one Noun.  The player must then use that Noun to guide their answer.<br/><br/>So, I draw "funnel" from the Noun pile, and begin describing what the characters see, working with whatever's already been established in this scene and about the world and its inhabitants.  I also don't ever say "funnel"; instead, I describe the shape of the structure the characters see.<br/><br/>The game can be silly, but it can also be very intense if the players get into imagining this confrontation with the total alien, unknown, unexplained.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450501/#Comment_450501" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-08T23:32:23+00:00" title="January  8, 2016 11:32PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2016 11:33PM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Cool, because I wrote: "Do note, roleplaying games work perfectly in their own way but not if you want the players to be challenged in a creative way by making descriptions.

I then INTIMIDATE the goblins into submission by turning into a HUGE APE before using my ROPE to tie them together."</i>\n<h3>Keep Up the Flow</h3>\nI started to notice some behavior from the players when I tried playing different kinds of games with descriptive challenges.<br/><br/><i>Continue to Change the Situation</i><br/>After five to seven descriptions, the inspiration for the players starts to fade and the players will focus more on the mechanics, if you got any, rather than the narration. Dungeons and Bananas, to give an example, fix this problem by updating the situation after all participants has taken one turn each.<br/><br/><i>Have a Maximum of Three Elements to Include in the Description</i><br/>"You must include a banana, a rope, and your fame." is an example of three elements that needs to be included in the description. This creates a descriptive challenge for the player. Three is the absolute maximum, because the player also needs to take into account what has previously happened and also their intent.<br/><br/>If the game requires more than three elements, then the player usually starts listing things rather than describing. "I smash in the door with my SHIELD, raising my HAMMER to INTIMIDATE the goblins inside" flows much better than trying to use five elements.<br/><br/><i>Make Them Know What to Expect</i><br/>A friend of mine made a game that had descriptive challenges. During fights, when we usually killed someone, a crit could instead kill 1d6 enemies. That was sometimes very unexpected and made some players freeze because they couldn't come up with how to describe it.<br/><br/>I myself have been in situations where I thought my game master would describe something but s/he instead gave me the power to describe when I didn't expect that. That sometimes froze me. I've done the same mistake as a game master too.<br/><br/>There is a reason why all moves in This is Pulp have the same three side effects.<br/><br/>It's better if these elements are known before using any game mechanics.<br/><br/><i>Keep (Rule) Acknowledges from the Game Master to a Minimum</i><br/>I said, in an earlier post, that if the mechanics takes too long to go through with, the descriptions usually bites the dust. Warhammer FRPG 3 and Burning Wheel are two examples where the game mechanics chops up the flow of the description.<br/><br/>I did phrase it differently though, saying "each element in a game system takes time". Every time the player needs to ask the game master something, it takes time. Did the enemy go down? What's the difficulty level to roll against? Is there a chair there? Give out all necessary information to the player before the roll so the player can start describing the result after using game mechanics.<br/><br/>As for the chair, let the players create things in the environment that should be there, or have the character have all the necessary stuff needed for achieving their intent.<br/><br/><i>Funny Games, Easy Worlds</i><br/>I could start quoting stuff from Impro, about player spontaneity and things like that. Instead, I will say this:<br/><br/>Another way to make it flow is to let the players be secure about what they can describe. Let they describe what they think is fun. Have everyone set the bar for what is decent descriptions, lowering it at some moments. Play in well-known worlds, like Indiana Jones or Star Wars. Play <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">humorous</span> silly games to help avoid any thoughts that the descriptions must be good enough in the other participants' eyes. That can otherwise be a creative block.<br/><br/><i>Visualize in the Head</i><br/>Avoid maps and figures because they tend to steal inspiration. The players will focus on what's on the map instead of making up new stuff. Let nothing exist until it's described, like that chair in the room.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3xJ" title="3xJ"><img alt="3xJ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3xJ">3xJ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450526/#Comment_450526" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-10T14:39:50+00:00" title="January 10, 2016  2:39PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2016 5:18PM by 3xJ.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Succinct descriptions Rickard!

I find that as long as expectations match, all is well. using well-known worlds is one way to do such. Well-known genres, making descriptions adhere to certain tones, and correlating expectations in the group itself can also foster a flow and set a bar for descriptions.<br/><br/>Try to play, a descriptive game such as dungeons and bananas but beore playing, set up the Microscope ban/inclusion phase, and use that to be the basis for both characters and the dungeon challenges. My guess is the game will be just as rewarding, and everyone will be engaged in the ongoing game.<br/><br/>Have you tried Swords Without Master? In that game, when you roll the dice, you must adhere to the tone which they dictate. Everything else in your description can be as you want. That game challenges creativity in many different ways.<br/><br/>Humorous games can also cause a block for some people - and i can personally vouch for that: <i>"What if they dont laugh? The other's descriptions made me laugh. Gah"</i><br/>\n<blockquote><br/>Make Them Know What to Expect<br/>A friend of mine made a game that had descriptive challenges.

I do think that if the game sometimes throws a wrench into your descriptive plans, that is something that challenges your creativity, right? <br/>I mean, if you roll the dice in swords without master, you for example roll the dice, and they tell you: <br/><br/>1. You are stymied in your action (pseudo-failure, which means that you cannot proceed all the way with your action).<br/>2. The stymie is caused by a superatural or mysterious element.<br/>3. The situation escalates<br/>4. You need to narrate what happens in a glum tone. <br/>Now - action!<br/><br/>You know what each element means, but their constellation relates uniquely to the situation at hand. And of course, you roll before you begin narrating. The difference from "banana" games though is the dice providing what must be included in your description, and do not relate to items or traits, but to different more ethereal concepts.<br/>\n<blockquote><br/>Visualize in the Head<br/>Avoid maps and figures because they tend to steal inspiration.

Everything else is completely up to you. So having a focus to direct and constrain inspiration can supplant the need for "a known world."                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheRoleplayer" title="TheRoleplayer"><img alt="TheRoleplayer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheRoleplayer">TheRoleplayer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450529/#Comment_450529" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-10T16:16:15+00:00" title="January 10, 2016  4:16PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have much to contribute with, but as my players are heavily set in more traditional gameplay (they're always willing to try indie stuff, but in play they instinctively default to a traditional mode), I managed to borrow two game techs for the homebrew game we're playtesting at the moment:<br/><br/>1) Instead of typical Attributes, we're using Attitudes (inspired by, but different from, Fate Accelerated approaches). These have different intensities, so the way players describe their actions has a direct impact on their strategies and narrative flavour. I've seen people criticising Approaches before because players will always try to use their strongest one, but I actually see that as a plus. It's not that far from granting a player XP for roleplaying their character's concepts properly, only the payoff is immediate. Besides, half the time that favourite approach would do more harm than good, IME.<br/><br/>2) One of my favourite pieces of game tech from recent years is found in Wildlings, by John Harper. After you roll the dice and count successes, you use those to buy adverbs to colour your action (Boldly, Carefully, Cleverly, Forcefully, Helpfully, Impressively, Precisely, Thoroughly, Quickly, Quietly), some of which may be bought more than once, and each adverb could have different strategic impact in the game. You may have to buy specific adverbs to counter an opponent's, for instante.<br/><br/>These two things definitely help players filter what they do in the fiction through meaningful description, perfectly backed by the mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450544/#Comment_450544" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-11T11:21:05+00:00" title="January 11, 2016 11:21AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2016 11:30AM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Every roll describes the character.</i>\n<h3>Build For That Flowing Conversation</h3>\nA normal conversation rarely have breaks in the flow. These breaks can happen in a game because a roll failed, because the player needs to ask the game master, or other things that momentarily blocks the participants.<br/><br/>In <i>Impro</i>, Keith Johnstone talks a lot about \xbbaccepting\xab and \xbboffering\xab. You can accept other ideas ("Yes"), you can accept by building on them ("Yes, and [this happens too]") but you shouldn't block ("Yes, but [this happens instead]"). Roleplaying games usually thrives on putting obstacles in the way, and I can understand that, but something has gone wrong when people tries to go "No, and" and "No, but". This happened because they haven't understood the principle of the "and/but" procedure. If you're going to block another person, at least offer something like "Yes, but" does. I usually go "No, because [of this new situation]" so, even if it's a failure, at least another situation is generated so the participant can respond to that.<br/><br/>And so is a conversation between the game master and the player born. The game master starts with creating a situation and then it's a back and forth between players and game master as they respond to each others actions.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I talked, in this thread, about avoiding descriptive mechanics, about how to instead make the players describe by leaving a gap between mechanics and descriptions, about the advantages of leaving the description out until after the use of game mechanics. About how many elements to include, after how many turns it takes before the inspiration runs out, how you should play in a world that everyone are familiar with.<br/><br/>All this comes down to one thing for the game system/master: keeping up the flow when the players describe their way out of a situation, and keeping them challenged at the same time.<br/><br/>One thing I mentioned was to keep the elements the players needed to include to a ordinary things, otherwise the whole experience could turn surreal. But if the element is descriptive in nature, how can the player be challenged? Using a tommy gun to kill goblins is self-descriptive and turns therefor the detailed description, that should be given after the game mechanics, into purely flavor. Further more, it will probably render the same description every time. Should I give -2 to the player if that player keeps on doing the same descriptions?<br/><br/>No, I should instead create various situations that challenge the player into using the weapon in different ways by thinking outside the box. Because it should be said that the game master is getting challenged in a creative way too, not by using the game mechanics, but by coming up with new situations for the players. Either at the start of a new scene or by responding to the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450545/#Comment_450545" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-11T12:36:22+00:00" title="January 11, 2016 12:36PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can do all that but instead of using the problem and the tool as bananas, you could use the description itself.

So, last night I searched youtube and found an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DMXXEMxQ0Q" rel="nofollow">online session of the game</a>. I dunno if it was the group or my own perception but it felt somewhat clunky and slow. <br/><br/>I give you that if, before this game, your group did roll playing more than roleplaying, you have advanced a lot. But giving descriptions while consciously thinking on the words you're using instead of focusing on the world on your mind that you're describing seems to take a toll on the flow of the game. Perhaps it's nothing that players more experienced on the system couldn't handle, but certainly doesn't look intuitive at use, even when understanding the system is actually quite intuitive.<br/><br/>Not that it doesn't do other interesting things; limiting the use of adverbs mechanically with the dice makes for a great challenge (Actually, I'd let the players roll before describing in this game. Here declaring intent and having the GM block it if you roll poorly makes the game even more clunkier, I'm not sure if they are playing it right or fell back to trad playing style by default.) Also, the GM can easily create complications just by looking at which adverbs haven't been used by the player. I'd add the concept that the default state isn't failure, so adverbs used by the players aren't blocked, though the situation could change and turn the challenge into something different.<br/><br/>For example, you could get <i>quickly</i> to the place where your pal is hanging from a rope in time to save him, but you didn't were <i>careful</i>, so now the terrain is giving up and you both are in danger of falling with it.<br/><br/>Also, playing with the concept of soft and hard GM moves and the timing on those from AW games would help a lot in this game. I haven't read the GM kit, perhaps there are these or other mechanics taking care of those points and the group in the video is just playing the game wrong.<br/><br/>All this tells me that there should be more intuitive ways of playing with descriptions, that mechanics should probably be optional and/or focus more on facilitating twists and increase tension. The actual game conversation should flow, and mechanics are there to aid that and not to get in the way.

It's possible to take this a step further, and people have touched this subject earlier in the thread.<br/><br/><i>Psychodrame </i>has Feelings and Social Communication Techniques as stats. The game is mostly about dialogues, and when using a stat to win a conflict, the player needs to play out what feeling or technique that the character using. The technique can be Avoidance or Manipulation while feelings are Anger, Love and stuff like that. This is another example of stats that influences but doesn't describe in themselves. Angry doesn't tell you WHAT to say, just HOW to say it.<br/><br/>Another game, <i>Nerver av st\xe5l</i> by <a href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">@Simon_Pettersson</a>, has rules for how you talk. The game is inspired by film noir and has the same rules of conducts as old noir movies - a list of what the scenes cannot contain. For example, you're not allowed to swear or show non-married couples kiss.<br/><br/>The scene framing is set through a monologue to the tunes of an appropriate song. The melody in in itself is a really powerful influence in how you choose your words and how you talk. Even when I played a different game a couple of tables away, I still got affected when Simon played those melodies while playtesting his game.<br/><br/>Other examples from this thread: \n<blockquote>It's Complicated is a rather succinct example of this. You draw a line and the system tells you "Now you need to set a scene to explain your relationship to Jenny and how you have a drug problem". The entire scene is the description and it's collaborative and when the description is over, the scene is over. This is actually kind of a descriptive challenge and the game I played wasn't silly at all (though the game at the next tabel had an inflation of alien babies). It's a game about exploration (of the characters' backgrounds and relationships). </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Moments are framed in turn by each Player.<br/>To frame a moment one has to say WHERE is your own Touched One (TO) at the moment, WHEN the moment happens, and what other TCs or NTCs are present.<br/>You must then add one or more sensory detail relative to the LOCATION (a color, a smell, a sound).<br/><br/>Then everyone start playing the Moment normally, with various fictional constraints:<br/>- only POV descriptions<br/>- absolutely NO unnatural, weird, creepy elements of any kind<br/>- ANY element of gore, violence, exotic stuff or shock material can only be described if filtered through 1 or 2 "degrees of separation" </blockquote>\n<blockquote>... Swords Without Master? In that game, when you roll the dice, you must adhere to the tone which they dictate. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>... you could use the description itself. "Describe how you gun down the goblins by using a metaphor". "Describe how you gun down the goblins by narrating your inner monologue", "Describe how you gun down the goblins by focusing on small details". </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450665/#Comment_450665" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-15T20:33:08+00:00" title="January 15, 2016  8:33PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen:<br/><br/>a) Games which encourage colourful description.<br/><br/>b) Games which encourage you to build on the descriptions of other players.<br/><br/>I would love to see more conscious design towards:<br/><br/>c) Games which encourage each player to create and use descriptions which give the other players things to build upon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450666/#Comment_450666" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-15T20:39:26+00:00" title="January 15, 2016  8:39PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2016 8:40PM by WarriorMonk.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm, that could be done with the "Roll to know how much adverbs + things on the scene you can use" rule, where in addition you can add things on a good roll or creatively reuse whatever the other players have made on a poor roll, to get what you wanted or at least avoid consequences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3xJ" title="3xJ"><img alt="3xJ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3xJ">3xJ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450679/#Comment_450679" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-16T17:51:03+00:00" title="January 16, 2016  5:51PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2016 5:53PM by 3xJ.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've seen:<br/>I would love to see more conscious design towards:<br/><br/>c) Games which encourage each player to create and use descriptions which give the other players things to build upon.</blockquote>\nThere are two games i know off that does that.<br/><br/><b>Swords without Master</b> does it through motifs. You vote descriptions of other players into the game, and in the last phase of the game, each player incorporates a conglomeration of 3 descriptions, called a "motif" back into the game. <br/>In addition, one element of each motif must echo a former motif. This mechanic really ties together each game with descriptive tropes. It always feels nice when someone writes down some part of your description.<br/><br/>The other game is <b>Fate</b>. It sort of does so with aspects, if your group engages with it as we did. To trigger an aspect, It must not only be fictionally plausible, but you must explain how. I know, i know, describing the already described can be pleonastic in nature. <br/>----<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450682/#Comment_450682" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-17T00:58:50+00:00" title="January 17, 2016 12:58AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Although I know what you mean, those mechanics sound more like my b) than my c).

There is a need to engage with the fiction, and to narrate descriptively, but also no "obvious" mechanical output, so we must go to the description to move the game along.</blockquote>\nThis is basically what I'm talking about. Usually fiction steers what mechanics to be used. "I jump down on the ogre" makes the player do a Jump roll before executing a Attack roll. This is just wrong. The player cannot describe anything that isn't supported by the game system. Some may protest, but listen: you're protesting because you're coming from a game design philosophy where the players need to adopt to the game system. I would prefer systems, in heavy-descriptive games, where the players <i>adopt to the genre</i> and the game system adopts to the players.<br/><br/>Here are two examples of systems I like:<br/><br/><b>Fiction -&gt; Fiction</b><br/><br/>In <i>Matin\xe9</i>, you can describe how you blind someone, but unless you use a game mechanic, it's a description that can be countered by the other person. "I throw sand in your eyes", "Oh, yeah? I slash with my sword before me as I back up and wipe away the sand." The game is designed so game system only looks at what the person wants to achieve mechanically but it can be described in different ways. They can use a fighting technique, in combination with the attack roll, that lowers the other person's defense, but they have to include a description how it looks like. If they do, then the opponent is blinded and cannot do anything about it because it's supported by the rule mechanics.<br/><br/>I actually used this narrative technique in describe-before-roll, where I describe someone throwing someone else out a window. A failed roll then allowed that person to counter that description. Yes, they were thrown out the window but now I want to hear how they got back in again. Of course, if you want to use this technique in a describe-before-roll games, only certain descriptions are suited for it. "I chop off your head" is not.<br/><br/><b>Mechanics -&gt; Mechanics</b><br/><br/>Imagine a PbtA game but where using a move can trigger 2-3 other moves. "OK, now she used [this move] so I have to respond by [this], [this], or [that]". This is where game mechanics release each other, but the result of using them are leaking into fiction to make sense of the use of them. Now imagine only having eight of these moves for all participants and where each move is more changing how the scene is played out.<br/><br/>Finally, imagine a session where different situations makes each move be interpreted in a different way. Just like, in <i>Feng Shui</i>, where each archetype changes the meaning of the skills (Martial Arts is described differently for a ninja than a big brute). This could be a diceless mechanic where the only uncertainty is the choice and directions taken by the other participants. A game that is different every time, only because it had a different starting situation.<br/><br/>Something I really want to point out here is (something I kind of hinted at earlier and) that is that you have both an intention with the fiction and what actually happens in the fiction. I described the game mechanics as starting as an 1) intention and then use 2) game mechanics to 3) produce a description of the game mechanics. I think there is the same thing with fiction. You have 1) an intention, and then 2) use fiction to 3) create a description.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450707/#Comment_450707" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-17T17:32:07+00:00" title="January 17, 2016  5:32PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2016 5:33PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard,<br/><br/>Unless I'm misunderstanding what you've written, those all sound like examples of "mechanics -&gt; (optional fiction) -&gt; mechanics" to me. For instance, I have a mechanic for reducing your defense value, and I describe throwing sand in your eyes. The outcome is that your defense value is reduced.<br/><br/>My experience with those games is that it's often tempting to skip the description altogether -&gt; "Ok, I'm going to roll reduce your defense value." "Oh, darn, you succeeded! I guess my defense value drops by one. What do you do now?"<br/><br/><i>Drakar Och Bananer</i> is another example: the game appears to be mostly about a mathematical challenge, and a group could play without narrating anything at all and still play it "successfully". (As a sort of dice-driven boardgame without a board.)<br/><br/>I was talking about mechanics which do not *do* anything except lead us to select or create more fiction. The example of the "Moment mechanic" is pretty good: it gives a player an opening to introduce something into the game that everyone is looking forward to hearing, and have come to the table to play.<br/><br/>In my game <i>Land of Nodd</i>, I use a similar thing. At certain points in the game, players have the option of including strange coincidences between unrelated storylines, and the results are one of the high points of the game, creating a sense of mystery and background story not known to the players.<br/><br/>Did I miss your point somehow?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Challenges in (creating) descriptive-heavy games - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20495/challenges-in-creating-descriptive-heavy-games/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Challenges in (creating) descriptive-heavy games - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20495/challenges-in-creating-descriptive-heavy-games/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content='Usually fiction steers what mechanics to be used.

If I play D&amp;D, there's no "support" in the game system for opening an unlocked door, yet I can describe this without problems. Rather, there are certain fictional "triggers" which makes you engage with the mechanics. Just like in Apocalypse World, though it's more explicit there.<br/><br/>I get what you're trying to say, though: the game reduces the number of fictional actions that are mechanically relevant. It's a gray area, though. A lot of games encourage the GM to improvise when there's no clear support in the rules. "Uh, ok, roll Acrobatics, and if you succeed you get +1 to your damage." The OSR gaming philosophy of "rulings not rules" exemplifies this attitude.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450724/#Comment_450724" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-18T13:42:20+00:00" title="January 18, 2016  1:42PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2016 1:56PM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> A lot of games encourage the GM to improvise when there's no clear support in the rules.

It's designed in a traditional way where the players need to adopt to the game system. (Do note, OSR has a totally different playstyle than descriptive challenges, as seen before in this thread when people have mixed that up.)<br/><br/>It's a huge difference with having fictional triggers (for mechanics) compared to what I suggest - a game system that adopts to whatever the player wants to achieve mechanically. "Rulings not rules" and "Don't say the name of the moves" are just workarounds, to me, for when the game mechanics haven't been designed for it.<br/><br/>I cannot explain this in a clear way but this stands: "The player cannot describe anything that isn't supported by the game system. Some may protest, but listen: you're protesting because you're coming from a game design philosophy where the players need to adopt to the game system."<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is two wrongdoings in game design for this particular playstyle described in this thread:<br/><b>First:</b> the player is limited to what the character sheet says. You look at your character sheet, looks at what kind of stats that has the highest scores, and then do it, almost always limited to what that stats says that you can do.<br/><b>Second:</b> you want to do something, you describe what you do, a rule is applied through this fictional trigger, but the player cannot decide what mechanical effect that will come of this - it's already decided for the player through the game mechanics.<br/><br/>Both these points boils together down this:\n<blockquote>And this?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/diceclouds/cloud-to-dice.jpg"/><br/><br/>It shouldn't exist in these types of descriptive-heavy games. </blockquote>\nTake for example grab rules that are usually waaay too complex. If someone describes the grab, in a traditional system, it triggers a grab mechanic and the player has to adopt to that.<br/><br/>Compare this to how grabbing works in Matin\xe9: it doesn't exist. The game purely focuses on what the player wants to achieve mechanically. Do they want to grab to take someone out? Do they want to grab to lower the opponent's defense? Do they want to grab so their actual attack is quicker? But none of these things are described as grabbing, it's up to the player to interpret what the game mechanics will actually will do. The player can do whatever, and then the game system forms itself around that. If they want to describe a grab, it's fiction-&gt;fiction (the other person needs to describe their way out of it), unless they tie a game mechanic to it, then it's fiction-&gt;fiction AND mechanic-&gt;mechanic. But it's <i>never</i> fiction-&gt;mechanic - a relation that makes the player adopt to the game system.<br/><br/>Also compare this to Drakar och bananer. Grab rules doesn't exist. Every item and trait is executed, mechanically, in the same way. You're not limited to <i>what</i> the item does, only to your imagination.<br/><br/>I think the important key here is \xbbintention\xab. Will the players' intentions be controlled by the game system, or can the players control the game system with their intentions? It's probably the same with fictional intention. Who controls it? The genre, the players, or the game system?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450725/#Comment_450725" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-18T20:06:39+00:00" title="January 18, 2016  8:06PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> <br/>I actually used this narrative technique in describe-before-roll, where I describe someone throwing someone else out a window.

As a GM my answer to this in a trad game nowadays wouldn't be "no, you miss" in case of a failed roll, it would be "You're sure you just chopped his head, but it turns out he twisted 360\xb0 his whole body ducking under your attack, so it gave you the illusion you had cut his head. You actually scratched the back of his head, but otherwise he's well enough to keep fighting"<br/><br/>What I mean isn't just to contradict this particular example, but to point out that there's a whole toolbox of non-written "social mechanics" that every group uses to keep normal "game mechanics" from ruining immersion. Those are the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18646/techniques-do-we-have-a-list-of-them#latest" rel="nofollow">Techniques</a>, which I've been advocating to include as actually written rules in any RPG since... the Forge, I think.<br/><br/>Techniques by themselves aren't nothing new, but it's something whose potential hasn't been being noticed until we came in contact with Finnish story games. There's an incredible wide field there that still needs to be researched: every group of players has developed many different techniques in a natural intuitive way, and some of these are genuine life savers for every game. Others are better used for a particular kind of game, to convey an specific atmosphere.<br/><br/>It's quite easy to miss them since they pass for logical everyday phrases, gestures or even attitudes. At the Forge I got terribly frustrated by the amount of people who thought I was just talking about "good game practices that everyone knows and does" and couldn't help me see where this thing could go. At that day I had only the slight impression I was standing on something but couldn't say exactly what, and thought that there should be someone there that could tell it better than me. But gradually I became convinced that we were all playing different games even when using the exact same rulebooks and settings, mainly because of the techniques employed. Today I still think these are the key to help a group understand how a game is meant to be played to attain Flow with it.<br/><br/>Back to how can these help us with descriptions and the given example, what is being done there is this: (I'll remark every word/phrase that I believe it's a technique)<br/> <br/>The player isn't <b>describing intent</b> but <b>imposing</b> a result, disregarding the dice influence on it. At most tables I've seen, on trad games, this is faux-pas; though usually GMs will <b>ignore the imposing and treat it as intent</b> to avoid argumenting with the player in favor of the flow of the game. But in my counterexample the GM chooses not to <b>block</b> but to <b>build over what the player said</b> and interpret the roll as the PC thinking he got what he wanted for a moment, except <br/>that it isn't true because the opponent made an incredible move to avoid it in the last moment. Going to this extent serves actually 3 purposes:<br/><br/>-Not blocking is by itself a show of trust of the GM in his players that invites them to trust him back.<br/>-Building upon what the player made is a show of recognition over their input. It's being valued and respected. That helps players attaining flow just by making them feel considered, which lowers their guard and get's their input flowing.<br/>-Showing players that the game needs cool, precise descriptions to flow better. If on the next turn the GM asks them "yes, but how do you do that?" the previous GM description will be taken as a measure of how much detail can be tolerated and what is the minimum expected. Repeat <b>not blocking</b> and <b>building over it</b> and that will work better than any game currency; I've seen it myself.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450726/#Comment_450726" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-18T20:24:53+00:00" title="January 18, 2016  8:24PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2016 11:39AM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I agree in large about the social mechanics.

Let them instead use these other ways of describing to help them out when the character can't help them or in other ways have to use them to move on.<br/><br/>Because research has shown that getting reward for creative work increases the intrinsic motivation of doing the task. The reward steals the focus from what is actually fun. You want people to describe for the fun of it (by playing with people enjoying it in the first place), not because of the reward.<br/></blockquote>\n<br/>The game i described was very currency focused, and not a smart one at that. Yup, i agree. <br/><br/>----<br/><br/>You mean <i>"decreases the intrinsic motivation?"</i><br/>If that is the case, i disagree wholeheartedly with research. I have never felt that way, and neither have my friends. know that higher wages do not increase motivation for creative tasks - but i am not perceiving a game as a job nor as work. We are talking about people, playing games for multifaceted reasons. And some, i think a lot, like rewards. Luke Crane's reward focused design clearly works, and people enjoy playing the game. Saying that reward based design diminishes intrinsic rewards, while it has a so large following, seems fallacious. I am not resisting what the research says. I just don't think it translates that well into games. <br/><br/>And even then, the idea that there are different types of rewards could help create rewards. If one stays in such terminology, creating a game where rewards represent "purpose" and "mastery" while avoiding stepping on one's creative "autonomy." could be a way for rewards can be effective, especially if they also serve to structure the game. An example could be this:\n<blockquote><br/><b>Swords without Master</b> does it through motifs. You vote descriptions of other players into the game, and in the last phase of the game, each player incorporates a conglomeration of 3 descriptions, called a "motif" back into the game. <br/>In addition, one element of each motif must echo a former motif. This mechanic really ties together each game with descriptive tropes. It always feels nice when someone writes down some part of your description.<br/></blockquote>\nI said, <i>"It always feels nice when someone writes down part of your description."</i> Here, there is an external reward, being <i>"someone writes down some part of your description"</i>, a direct compliment, the reward also communicates mastery of "what is good at the table"  while elevating your description with purpose. <br/><br/>I don't find this "steals" the fun, it focuses attention on what should be fun:  describing the game and hitting the genre tone while pleasing the people around the table.<br/><br/>The problem with motifs is getting players to engage with them. One of my players said that motifs "dangle." Because they only feed fiction back, the changes do impact anything with permanence. And i agree with him. There is no logging, growth or shrinkage of the physical and tactile elements in a swords without master game, only change. I guess "the dangle" comes from everything not following the same base mechanical loop, or not feeding into it. Maybe we are falsely placing the guilt on the lack of rewards.<br/><br/><b>Therefore</b><br/>I think rewards cannot just be dismissed in descriptive heavy game. By supplying both external and intrinsic rewards could draw more players, who will all be experience their ever elusive and different kinds of "fun"?<br/><br/>external rewards in games where each player has a single character, if they are logged somewhere, can make for a longer lasting game-campaign. Maybe it is the skinner-box at work, but i think that being compelled can be a very compelling experience, as long as it is not the only element at work to engage the player. <br/><br/>I do not have extensive scientific reports to back me up, but all of my friends like rewards, both external and intrinsic. Games with rewards and growth have greater longevity in my group, and are met with greater level of enthusiasm...<br/>I know we exist in a reward driven paradigm, but an option is also to make the rewards meaningful, full of purpose and signalling mastery. Make them layered, and make the rewards fullfill many functions - and vice versa.<br/><br/>----\n<blockquote><br/>Intent -&gt; Roll -&gt; Description may not be ideal for all games, but that doesn't stop me from trying!<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI feel such "fortune in the middle" mechanics is something which can be used to generate a cool sense of tension and anxiety. Imagine that you risked all that which you described before rolling. Imagine that if you describe someone else, as a cue, they are allowed to help you in the action, describing their addition to the fiction.<br/><br/>When we play dungeons and bananas, we first did it the correct way, fortune first. But we now prefer playing fortune in the middle. Primarily because it dedicates one to ones action, giving a sense of being in a "free fall" as the dice rolled and their results were read. For us, that felt like creative challenge of reincorporating the trouble added.<br/><br/>This does definitely not mean that fortune in the middle cannot be problematic, as evidenced here: \n<blockquote>So this is the reason why it's good to not allow description of intent in Dungeons &amp; Bananas. Just go "I'm using my Potion of Metamorphosis and my Carpentry skill to get past the guards." Everyone is going "Uhm, how the heck do you figure?" and then when the description comes after the roll, they're listening with interest. If you go "I'm going to build a little toy bird that will get the guards' attention and then spray them with potion, turning them into sheep" and THEN roll, people won't be as interested in your description. It's a bit of "play before play".<br/><br/>And yes, I think this mode of playing is mostly for "silly" gameplay. D&amp;B is silly and fun, but I don't think it's a good system to play horror or drama with. Maintaining fictional coherence needs to be a low focus for this technique to work.</blockquote>\nEnvisioning how our group would do that is probably describing something like "I sit in my workshop, carving logs to sticks, and assembling those in elaborate fashion. My cauldron sits bubbling behind me, as the sheepskull it contains brays alive yet again as it dissolves in the fluorescent liquid. I look to the guardspost, a new fledgling toy bird in hand" Then roll the traits.<br/><br/>And everyone still thinks... "Uhm, How the heck do you figure?"<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Warriormonk, i have always found that techniques define the game at the table. And this reminded me of the lumpley-care principle. Google-fu, activate! <br/>"System (including but not limited to 'the rules') is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play."<br/>Well, i do agree to that statement! \n<blockquote><br/> every group of players has developed many different techniques in a natural intuitive way, and some of these are genuine life savers for every game. Others are better used for a particular kind of game, to convey an specific atmosphere. </blockquote>\nBy codifying and hiding techniques behind rules and baking them into mechanics enforces the type of experience you want all people at all tables, playing your game, to have. If the game mechanics enforce or incentivize for example, <b>not blocking</b> and <b>building over</b> the game will be better for it, i presume.<br/><br/>---<br/>I truly think an examination of different techniques, sorted under different types of games, genres, tables, and players would be a truly invaluable thing to have on the forum.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450731/#Comment_450731" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-19T01:38:46+00:00" title="January 19, 2016  1:38AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> <br/><b>Mechanics -&gt; Mechanics</b><br/><br/>Imagine a PbtA game but where using a move can trigger 2-3 other moves. "OK, now she used [this move] so I have to respond by [this], [this], or [that]". This is where game mechanics release each other, but the result of using them are leaking into fiction to make sense of the use of them. Now imagine only having eight of these moves for all participants and where each move is more changing how the scene is played out.<br/><br/>Finally, imagine a session where different situations makes each move be interpreted in a different way. Just like, in <i>Feng Shui</i>, where each archetype changes the meaning of the skills (Martial Arts is described differently for a ninja than a big brute). This could be a diceless mechanic where the only uncertainty is the choice and directions taken by the other participants. A game that is different every time, only because it had a different starting situation.<br/><br/>Something I really want to point out here is (something I kind of hinted at earlier and) that is that you have both an intention with the fiction and what actually happens in the fiction. I described the game mechanics as starting as an 1) intention and then use 2) game mechanics to 3) produce a description of the game mechanics. I think there is the same thing with fiction. You have 1) an intention, and then 2) use fiction to 3) create a description.</blockquote>\nHmmm, ok, this actually got me trying to think a game like that. So, If I got you right it could look like:<br/><br/>-Write generic GM moves on cards (not sure if all from PbtA games would work unchanged), make more that one copy of each. Shuffle the deck and place it within everyone's reach.<br/><br/>-Start playing as usual. GM guides the story, keeps the coherence, arbitrates disputes, describes and plays NPCs, creates the challenges and complicates them when necessary.<br/><br/>-Whenever anyone wants to try something they describe how they do it from their character point of view, based on the fiction. They must use three things in their description to describe it as a sucessful action or, otherwise, describe what happens to prevent their sucess (except that they can't describe how their character just misses or fails horribly. It must be either the opponent doing something totally unexpected or the challenge otherwise complicating in another way. The three things they must use in their description are: <br/><br/>1) Something related to their character (like an item, skill, background, etc)<br/>2) Something related to the place they are (surrounding objects, obstacles, opponents or their belongings)<br/>3) Something related to another PC (where they are, what does it look like they are saying/doing, a brief flashback/advice from that PC that applies to the current situation)<br/><br/>-Then that player chooses the next one, which then draws a card and narrates the consequences based on the move in the card, from their own point of view, building over whatever the other player said. There's no blocking on this game, so whatever the previous player says keeps standing. So here's the real challenge: How do you describe the twist given by the move in your card with those limits? How do you connect that to your own action/reaction? You can reuse whatever another player has described as long as the fiction states it's still usable and your character can reach it, so no blocking there either.<br/><br/>-Additional rule: anyone can add color or ask the player to add more color to their description. Whoever adds the color then gets a token (not accumulable) that they can spent on their next action to avoid using one of the 3 things mentioned. Color can be anything from detail of an object, character, creature to noises, appropiate soundtrack for the moment, references or drawings to help understand the scene and atmosphere.<br/><br/>I just got till there, how does it sound?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450733/#Comment_450733" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-19T03:10:19+00:00" title="January 19, 2016  3:10AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2016 4:05AM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If that is the case, i disagree wholeheartedly with research.

"Oh, darn, you succeeded! I guess my defense value drops by one. What do you do now?"</blockquote>\nMy experience is that it happens after 5-7 actions. This is a flaw in <i>Matin\xe9</i>, but it was also my first designed game for this type playstyle. I learned a lot from creating it.<br/><br/>I should say that the techniques have descriptions as a requirement for using them, otherwise it will probably happen what you wrote right from the start.\n<blockquote><i>Drakar Och Bananer</i> is another example: the game appears to be mostly about a mathematical challenge, and a group could play without narrating anything at all and still play it "successfully". (As a sort of dice-driven boardgame without a board.)</blockquote>\nI think you have a point. If the game is too mechanical or has "gamey" elements then the players (and some players more than others) are bound to leave out the description. <br/>I'm not keen myself on mixing two game styles in one game.<br/><br/>I recently played a descriptive-heavy game where we left out the descriptions in favor to the mechanics. On the other hand, nothing in the game forced us to describe. It was just an added "Oh, and you should narrate what happens" with the narration being nothing but flavor.<br/><br/>My own <i>This is Pulp</i> has a really boring mechanic, really. The game master puts forth tokens and the players takes one when they want to act. When the tokens are gone, the challenge is over. The game is nothing without the  descriptions. (I learned from my mistakes.)\n<blockquote>Rickard,Unless I'm misunderstanding what you've written, those all sound like examples of "mechanics -&gt; (optional fiction) -&gt; mechanics" to me. For instance, I have a mechanic for reducing your defense value, and I describe throwing sand in your eyes. The outcome is that your defense value is reduced.</blockquote>\nIt's fiction-&gt;fiction AND mechanics-&gt;mechanics. The other player must respond to the sand throwing in fiction, if they want to act next.\n<blockquote>I was talking about mechanics which do not *do* anything except lead us to select or create more fiction. The example of the "Moment mechanic" is pretty good: it gives a player an opening to introduce something into the game that everyone is looking forward to hearing, and have come to the table to play.<br/><br/>In my game <i>Land of Nodd</i>, I use a similar thing. At certain points in the game, players have the option of including strange coincidences between unrelated storylines, and the results are one of the high points of the game, creating a sense of mystery and background story not known to the players.</blockquote>\nThis sounds cool.

But then, if players see what they have, the one who has "exchange damage" can feel tempted to signal the active player to choose him if this is what the scene needs. However I'm okey if each player draws a card before the scene begins and don't look at it until they are chosen to narrate, or if everyone has more than one card and which card from their hand is played is also randomly chosen.<br/><br/>I'd prefer having a GM because you always get better material if you do prep scenes, twists, fronts, monsters, bangs, etc. But for me these aren't all supposed to be included in the game nor define the direction of the story; instead, they are meant to keep the game from stalling or even to improve the game experience when the players suggest something similar. <br/><br/>Besides keeping coherence, I'd personally keep the GM for another reason. I'd said before that there shouldn't be blocking in this game, though player sensibility to certain subjects or atmospheres often requires someone to block/veto certain sort of input, throw a veil on it, pull back the camera, etc to protect players sensibility. Democracy in games works best when all players want something to happen, not when the majority imposes something over the rest of players, so having a GM take control and be responsible over that is the simpler solution, only because having all the group talk to reach an agreement takes more time and effort than follow a GM lead. Of course, the GM should be the most sensitive player or it will do more bad than good with these tools.<br/><br/>I guess I could leave up to the players to choose between a GM or GMfull version anyway.\n<blockquote><br/>Not keen on the reward.

But this:\n<blockquote><br/>I'm do see what you did there, by having them buy off one of the "bananas" with the color token, so the descriptions wouldn't be as repetitive.<br/></blockquote>\n... was neither what I had in mind; you're right, it works better than I expected! The archipielago techniques are all right, it was exactly what I thought when I wrote that "-Additional rule: anyone can add color <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or ask the player to add more color to their description.</span>" <br/><br/>Also, there's a thing with the cards that I'm probably confused/confusing, as I can't remember PbtA GM moves as written right now. What I thought is that while you can easily narrate your character succeeding, the consequences of your actions are always defined randomly by the player you choose to narrate it. So yes, you might have chopped your opponent's head off, but then you look down to see his axe is stuck on your guts.<br/><br/>Then another player can gesture and make blood-splashing noises, to get a token for that.

On the other direction, there is barely anything. You can only use Traits and Items that fit into a fictional situation, but it really works the other way: you pick anything you wish (so you can pick the best mechanical option) and then create the description.

Social (verbal) rewards can actually increase  the intrinsic reward (as shown on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect#/media/File:Overjustification_Effect_Rewards_and_Motivation.jpg" rel="nofollow">the graph</a> in the overjustification Wikipedia article).<br/><br/>So external rewards work if the task is boring, physical, or a competition, or if the reward itself is a social one. Having someone building on your description is indeed a social one, so I think we agree with each other.\n<blockquote>I feel such "fortune in the middle" mechanics is something which can be used to generate a cool sense of tension and anxiety. Imagine that you risked all that which you described before rolling. Imagine that if you describe someone else, as a cue, they are allowed to help you in the action, describing their addition to the fiction.<br/><br/>When we play dungeons and bananas, we first did it the correct way, fortune first. But we now prefer playing fortune in the middle. Primarily because it dedicates one to ones action, giving a sense of being in a "free fall" as the dice rolled and their results were read.</blockquote>\nOn the other hand, the mechanics in Dungeons and Bananas sometimes provide that tension anyway at the end of the encounter, during those times when you need to roll 8 successes and only 2 of them can be trouble.<br/><br/>Fortune in the middle is, by the way, "rolling first, affecting the roll after", which can mean "roll-&gt;describe" or "roll-&gt;change outcome of roll". I'm not keen on using that term, so I rather talk about giving the descriptions weight instead.\n<blockquote>If you go "I'm going to build a little toy bird that will get the guards' attention and then spray them with potion, turning them into sheep" and THEN roll, people won't be as interested in your description. It's a bit of "play before play".</blockquote>\nSure, but this feels a little bit like the setup you described is falling under the Czege principle: involve other people, otherwise it's boring.

(Often it's just the Trouble.)<br/><br/>Rickard,<br/><br/>I'm very curious about the whole idea that rewarding actions decreases people's motivation to participate in those actions in the first place. <br/><br/>On one hand, the science supports this concept quite firmly. On the other hand, it seems to go against a lot of people's actual experience with games.<br/><br/>What are your thoughts on that? Are people just deluded, or does it depend somehow on the type of reward and how it relates to the game?<br/><br/>The "Forgist" line of thought here was something like this: what matters is the reward cycles of play. If some action is being rewarded with a form of currency, it should feed back into constructive play, to launch the next cycle.<br/><br/>(So, for example, gaining XP for your D&amp;D character allows you to take on the greater challenge you've been waiting for, and therefore leads to more adventure.)<br/><br/>To take a more extreme example, in Monopoly you are rewarded for good play by earning $$$. I've never seen a player get "disincentivized" by this procedure and stop trying to get more money, because that's how you win the game. Clearly the incentives are working here.<br/><br/>In my own experience, when something feels like it's not part of the game, it's a chore. (For instance, "roleplaying" bonuses in a dungeon crawl game.) But when the rewards tie directly into other moving parts of play, it feels very organic and effective.<br/><br/>So, how do you see this discrepancy? What's really happening, and how does the science meet the game theory?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450829/#Comment_450829" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-22T19:27:06+00:00" title="January 22, 2016  7:27PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2016 7:27PM by WarriorMonk.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel the answer is linked to what I mentioned before: the social reward. Mechanical reward also works as a limited form of social reward in the sense that it's often granted with a basis on the perception of the GM or the rest of the players; that's like, when the GM gives you inspiration or hero points, you are not only receiving mechanical currency, but actual recognition from the GM. <br/><br/>The currency again, doesn't matter, what matters is that somebody is giving it to you for a reason, which in the case of the game, isn't an imposition, like in real money rewards to hard-workers. In the latter case, the money doesn't actually represent respect nor recognition from anybody you respect or look up to, it's just something you were promised if you did something and doesn't mean anything else for you.<br/><br/>So, it's totally different to receive recognition from your friends in the shape of game currency for describing or roleplaying better, than to receive a reward from a total stranger for doing something agreed beforehand between you two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450832/#Comment_450832" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-23T06:11:56+00:00" title="January 23, 2016  6:11AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2016 12:17AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edited to move my comment to the other thread.

I've railed against stuff like Fanmail much like Rickard has, and I think there's lots of bad stuff that can happen with reward systems. With rewards that are given out mechanically (that is, triggered by somthing in the game), you can for example end up in a lot of situations where you have to choose between what would be awesome and what is rewarded. This happened a lot to me in Apocalypse World, for example, which I think has a very problematic reward system. You know, "It'd be super sweet and fun if I punched this guy in the face right now, but I've got Hot highlighted, so I'll manipulate him instead". I also think reward systems are responsible for those campaigns where people keep playing past the point where it's fun and the campaign finally just peters out into nothing.<br/><br/>For those and other reasons, I'm very wary of reward systems, and usually just use rewards to highlight that an action is bad and you shouldn't do it, by rewarding you for doing it (it works wonders, and the fact that you can discourage an action by rewarding it highlights that rewards are pretty complicated). But at the same time I'm sure they can be used well, too, and there are obviously a lot of people who have fun with games that use them heavily. It might be personal preference to some extent, it might well be cultural differences (socialist Sweden vs. capitalist US?), it might be a lot of reasons. It's a pretty complicated issue and I think it's hard to draw sweeping conclusions about them in general, though I think there's a lot of discussions on pros and cons to have about specific reward systems, where the research Rickard has pointed to can play an important role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450837/#Comment_450837" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-23T13:28:25+00:00" title="January 23, 2016  1:28PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Doesn't the entirety of dungeons and bananas fall under the Czege principle then?</blockquote>\nI need an example of that to be able to answer the question.\n<blockquote>...say beginning of fictional course of action -&gt; roll -&gt; let the trouble impact and inform the end of the course of action.<br/></blockquote>\nSo the trouble gave someone else an excuse to act? Yeah, that's when the game works the best in my opinion.
