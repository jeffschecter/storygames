I dabbled a bit with a brief Planescape campaign I ran with 2e back in the 90's. Got started in RPGs with 1e of course. I missed the 3.x boat entirely. Never played or ran a single game of it. Bought the books. Read 'em. Just wasn't my thing. D&amp;D was off my radar for over a decade.<br/><br/>So I was very skeptical of 4e. Very. So much so that when I was invited into this 4e campaign I was <i>this</i> close to backing out because I didn't think the new version would agree with me. I went back and forth on this decision for a couple of weeks.<br/><br/>I was wrong. It did agree with me. I found a whole new game. I'm glad I don't really have a lot to compare it too. If I were a 3e lover (or hater) I'd be fighting that baggage but it turns out the new D&amp;D is a blank slate for me and I really liked it. Basically, I just accepted it for what it is and judged it on its own merits (which I admit was hard at first because of my aversion to the previous edition). No, it isn't DitV, or The Mountain Witch, but that's okay. Ive learned to differentiate my gaming tastes, so when I want what those games give me, I'll play them. D&amp;D gives me a character to power up, a monster manual to chop through, and lots of phat lewt, and if a story comes out of it, even better! I won't play it to the exclusion of all else, but I will play it - might even run it some time.<br/><br/>Anyway, 4e tasted good to me!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161517/#Comment_161517" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T13:39:27+00:00" title="August  8, 2008  1:39PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Delicious!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
