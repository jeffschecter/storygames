My usual group were playing.<br/><br/>After the usual wrangling about setting and who's comfortable with what type of show, we settled on the fact that, since I didn't have the energy to bring a specific tone to the table, we'd end up with something darkly comic regardless of what we tried, so we built around that.<br/><br/>Hence, "Ultimate Justice Squad: Bromley" was born, a series about fairly crap superheroes.  <br/><br/>We ended up with these characters:<br/><br/>Claire playing "El Vino" AKA Sophie - A female wrestler and pretty typical brick type super who whines all the time.<br/><br/>Dave playing "The Karmanator" AKA Stan - A guy who can manipulate his luck to be really lucky.  Only problem is that, at some point later the balance is restored ad something really bad happens to him to even things out.<br/><br/>Greg playing "Really Useful Stuff Man" AKA Eugene - A gadgeteer who's inventions are way to complex to actually ever use.<br/><br/>We ran through a couple of quick scenes where a minotaur villain was trashing Bromley high street.  At the end, he escaped, but it was revealed that this was in fact "Bull-ee", Useful Stuff Man's nemesis-to-be and a guy who used to pick on him at school.  The purpose was  really just to get the players used to the system and get ready for next week.  Except next Thursday we're not gaming because we're at the cinema seeing Pirates 3.<br/><br/>All in all a pretty good session.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott%20Dorward" title="Scott Dorward"><img alt="Scott Dorward" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott%20Dorward">Scott Dorward</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70174/#Comment_70174" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T09:26:55+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  9:26AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to live in Bromley.

Investigating, they find that Bull-E shares and allotment with Stan's mum.  They find him and he kicks their arses, but not before the involvement of The Depford Wives is revealed.<br/><br/>The actual game was somewhat more complex than that, but I just want to talk about the juicy stuff here:<br/><br/>I've played PtA a few times and run it before.  This game seems to have taken a somewhat different approach to all the other times I've played though.  The players pretty much all keep together the whole time, which for this show seems to work rather well.  That seems to lead to an interesting thing: each scene set by a player almost always started (very naturally) pretty much immediately after the last.  Three of the four players have played before and this behaviour never came up before.  This came about very organically.<br/><br/>There was a lot of humour.  The tone is very much like Red Dwarf or Hyperdrive.  Although Hyperdrive wasn't very good.  The humour wasn't the kind that translates to text very well though.<br/><br/>In all, a very cool game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
