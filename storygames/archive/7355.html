The PCs are anthropomorphic animals descended from uplift experiments made during the long dark time when humanity fought against threats both internal and external - human warmongers, computers roused to self-awareness and psychological unstable, and monsters the furries don't know much about. Eventually humanity did win, fix up all the damage, make sure to provide for the furries' long-time needs and went...somewhere. Maybe several somewheres. Transcendence? Space? The Dreamtime? The furries don't know. They just share the conviction that humanity will be back when the time is right. <br/><br/>In the meantime, they mostly play and lead enjoyable lives, punctuated by times of conflict against some of the enemies who still show up occasionally. There are the computers that get strange ideas, and the Bugs (hardy coleopterans who claim the world is theirs and humanity gone for ever), and the fish-people and squid-people who come up from the deep seas with similar claims, and the mysterious flying things that come down from the Moon on dark nights, and so on. My goal for this initial project is to set an overall more or less stable situation - the enemies aren't going to take over the whole world right away unless stopped, and like that. (That's a possibility for a follow-up.)<br/><br/>The furries all have some traits in common. My working list is Beauty, Fairness, Play, Truth, and Win. I'm looking at using Fudge for this, with some qualities fixed for relatively long periods and some points to be assigned daily or something like that to reflect priorities of the moment. The first four traits are about awareness and the ability to apply that awareness. Cats are high in awareness of Beauty, for instance, and use it for gracious posing. Most dogs don't know from Beauty, but are very good with Fairness if they're not too worked up. Win covers all the goofy stuff like <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/06/060613-cat-bear.html" rel="nofollow">cats chasing bears up trees</a> - physical damage, sheer intimidation, and so on. The major furry races will also have 2-3 unique qualities, with characters starting with one and maybe getting more later.<br/><br/>(I'm seriously not worried about overall advancement for a game like this, but the ability to adjust point assignment in light of adventures had should have a place.)<br/><br/>Conflict, as I see it now, is a matter of accumulating victory points over multiple rounds via the trait of your choice. Each round's successes can either go into your own victory pool or reduce an enemy's victory pool. The first to reach the total needed gets to define the scene in terms of their chosen approach. A Beauty-based victory against a killer robot, for instance, might involve using light and shadow to evoke the glorious, dimly remembered human form and cow the robot into retreat, or making the furries look like something hideous the robot knows it can't fight. (The quality, its absence, and its inversion are all fair game.) I'm still poking at the pacing of this, definitions of different kinds of success, and like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163506/#Comment_163506" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T21:22:37+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  9:22PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's Big Breasts Small Waist, which I can't seem to locate a copy of at the moment.<br/><br/>I'm working on and off on a game called "Hot Guys Making Out."<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163508/#Comment_163508" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T21:32:11+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  9:32PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure how fringe <b>CthulhuTech</b> is, but I quite like it: best description I've heard is "CthulhuTech is to Lovecraft as Evangelion is to John the Baptist."<br/><br/>...on an unrelated note: Ben, just for that game concept, I now love you even more.

If I can share some advice, mine the hell out of the book for its setting and situation, for these are surely things mined from deep down in the caves of Mount Radness.  As for the system, it is confusing, overly-detailed, and not terribly fun.  Back away from it slowly, then run like hell.  I've been slowly working on a very focused Mecha Anime hack for Spirit of the Century/ Fate for use with this game and I feel it works pretty damned well.  I would suggest the same if that's what you're going for.  <br/><br/>And, Filip, to further clear up your request of us here... what exactly are you looking for?  What kind of anime are you looking to emulate in your game?  Cute adventure (Urusei Yatsura), giant mecha space opera (Macross), bizarre science fiction (The Melancholy of Haruhi IForgotHerLastName), samurai drama (The Hakenden), shonen action (Naruto)... <br/><br/>To me, asking for an Anime-emulating RPG is like asking for one that emulates all of television or all film.  If you want something that does that, then PTA is really the only way to go.  It's like Andy said above.  I get that you're polling to see what games are out there that have been influenced by anime, but I'd really love to see that the outcome of this thread is that you also get directed to a game that you yourself would love playing.

I *am* 100% committed eventually finishing it.  My motivation to make it is that I want more Castlevania than exists or probably ever will exist.  I am a huge Castlevania geek, serious.<br/><br/>In combat, you've got a limited set of maneuvers (which you create yourself) you can perform.  You pick one, and  you and your opponent simultaneously reveal the maneuvers you chose.  You have to try to 1) anticipate what your opponent will do based on his stance (there are 7 stances, each permitting only certain maneuvers), so that you can select a maneuver that will 2) best inflict damage and/or penalties on the enemy, 3) avoid getting hit yourself, and 4) maintain an advantageous position on the battlefield (which is drawn out on a grid).  Basically, it's a sort of customizable hybrid of rock/paper/scissors with chess.  The whole idea is based directly off of the combat dynamic in the 2d Castlevanias, which is *all about* things 1-4 above (I play the HELL out of the 2d games).  Oh, and everybody gets only a few seconds to choose maneuvers.<br/><br/>A maneuver is made out of a set of effects.  The more effects, and the more effective those effects are, the greater the resource cost of the maneuver--making high-power maneuvers self-balancing.  <br/><br/>The framework of the game is basically dungeoncrawling, one big dungeon split up into stages, further split into rooms.  The PCs are hunting Dracula (or a Dracula stand-in; I've got this idea for a widowed sorceress driven mad with grief who uses her husband's skull to do magic).  The GM has a "threat budget" that he spends to throw monsters and hazards at the players, and he can buy it back up by hiding treasure throughout the stage.  The budget replenishes and is increased when the players reach the next stage.  <br/><br/>PCs don't die unless all of them get taken down in the same fight; they just Go Down.  Each time you get wounded, there's a chance you will Go Down.  The more wounds you've accumulated, the greater that chance.  This is a big deviation from the source material, but I don't like hitpoints.<br/>(It also might sound odd to have a party of PCs, but Castlevania III supports the concept, as does the novel <i>Dracula</i>)<br/><br/>There's only two attributes:  one that determines the chance you will Go Down when wounded, and one that determines your ability to shrug off detrimental effects.  Things like attack power and speed and crap are all subsumed into the maneuvers.  The only advancement is learning new maneuvers.<br/><br/>Periodically, there's interludes of verbal interaction with the villain or his minions.  They'll appear sometimes to try to taunt you, mislead you, confound you, etc., and you get to have a sort of duel of wits with them.  If you win, you get some sort of advantage.  Maybe you trick them into revealing some information, or you wound them, or something.  I'm still working this part out.  I'd like to do these without dice or anything, using some kind of escalating tit-for-tat.<br/><br/>Oh, and the whole time, the players are competing to have the highest score once Dracula (or whoever) is defeated.  I'm shooting for Step on Up, not Story Now.  I mean, there's a story, but it's kinda frontloaded:  there's Dracula, you have a special reason you want to kill him, you hunt him down, you face a bunch of ordeals, you square off with Dracula, and you finally kill him.  Or you die trying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163720/#Comment_163720" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T11:36:26+00:00" title="August 20, 2008 11:36AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2008 11:37AM by Rafu.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Filip Luszczyk</cite>Ewen,<br/>the cards are very likely to make it impossible for me to play these games via Skype, unfortunately.</blockquote>\nA remote boardgaming / virtual tabletop software such as <a href="http://www.zuntzu.com/" rel="nofollow">ZunTzu</a>(which is free) could easily handle the cards for you, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163746/#Comment_163746" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T12:35:31+00:00" title="August 20, 2008 12:35PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm writing a game called <i>Mecha</i> which, as you might have guessed, draws heavily from mecha anime.

It's currently incomplete, but should be (re)entering alpha playtesting soon. When I'm ready for external playtesting, I'll probably post something on Story Games. My <a href="http://www.gandygames.com" rel="nofollow">design blog</a> discusses the game somewhat, so you can look for updates there.<br/><br/>Basically, <b>Seiyuu </b>is a love letter to PTA. I like what PTA does, but I feel that it's missing certain things, like guidance on the pitch session. I've had pitch sessions run four hours, and I've heard of them taking two sessions. So that's one of the things I wanted to address with Seiyuu.<br/><br/>Mostly, <b>Seiyuu </b>is about anime tropes and expectations. There are certain recognizable things about anime visuals (big eyes and small mouths being the tip of the iceberg) and genre expectations (magical girl anime falls into two categories and follows several specific conventions, for example). That's currently the bread and butter of <b>Seiyuu</b>. My goal is to allow players to game through multiple episodes of their own anime series (or movie), contributing as player, producer/seiyuu, and character.<br/><br/>The game uses index cards and poker chips. Regular playing cards may re-enter the mix, but right now its system is non-random. I realize that may make it difficult to play over Skype, but since I play over Skype myself and hope to playtest the game that way, I will be keeping an eye to possible solutions.<br/><br/>Feel free to email me or comment on my blog if you'd like more info, as I don't check Story Games very frequently these days.<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix" title="zoatebix"><img alt="zoatebix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix">zoatebix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164041/#Comment_164041" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T09:45:07+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  9:45AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even though it doesn't come from the Forge, the crazy madcap fact-declaring in <a href="http://www.tiltingatwindmills.net/adgnepsef555/index.html" rel="nofollow">Advanced Dimensional Green Ninja-Educational Preparatory Super-Elementary Fortress 555</a> makes it pretty fringe-y.

When I think of anime, I also think of the conventions associated with it. To make a long story short, I think a lot of games out there are totally "anime" in a Schr\xf6dinger's Box style "it is both anime and non-anime, depending on the observer" way.<br/><br/>So, to the list I'd add these, with a little bit of explanation, pointing out their "fringe bits":<br/><br/><b>Exalted</b>: Not as fringe, but it has an economy of well-designed die pools to do everything. With these, and playing up the Virtues and Virtue flaws, you have powerful characters that are utterly badass in their field of expertise, yet (can be) all angsty and emo.<br/>Only problem: The scale of the game, compounded with the exclusion-based charm effects, basically make this a game where the GM needs to know all the charms/powers at all times in order to build decent encounters. Also, you're throwing fistful of dice, All The Time.<br/><br/><b>Anima: Beyond Fantasy</b>: I just picked this up (mostly for the art and design, and to see what it was all about), so I haven't read it through and through, but the heart of the game is essentially something as complex as Rolemaster served on a plate of fringe. Most of this $60 300+ page book is... wait for it... character generation and chargen/experience related, with very little that isn't (monster stats, a few pages on the setting). Percentile systems, all that jazz. However, it has some fringe out there which makes it a game worth looking into as a bridge game between those "fringe/non fringe" waveforms. Unfortunately I'm at work now so I can't remember it all, but the experience system is based upon the idea of the tarot major arcana, and reads a lot like TSOY's keys. You gain a lot of experience/power by selecting a god (one that conforms to what you want your hero to do, like "gain treasure" or "help people in need" or "fall in love") and hit a bunch of select requirements to gain xp based upon that god. There are a few clever bits like that.<br/><br/><b>Hellas</b>: OK, I've been talking this shit up constantly since GenCon, but it's because it's the game that has recently owned my ass in a big way. I'm all about the kind of game that combines light traditional mechanics (skill rolls, etc) with hippie-style fringe mechanics. Tenra Bansho is an example of this (skill rolls, combat is traditional, but all power in the game is attained by gaining "fan mail"), and so is Hellas. It combines the following:<br/>* Agon-style Fate mechanics (take a point of Fate to gain an immediate bonus: At 10, your character dies).<br/>* Generational roleplaying: You. Will. Die. But your next character, related to the first somehow (child, sibling, friend) picks up where you left off. They will gain "glory" (a mechanic indicating how powerful you are, how much you can affect fate) passed from the first character.<br/>* Everyone is required to take three disadvantages, one from each of three categories. Everyone, including "quiet dude who shoots/stabs things", must take a Relationship flaw. Bring those up in play, and you can gain hero points (which let you affect die rolls).<br/>* All characters have goals, defined ones ala "Muses" in Nine Worlds. Play them hard, and you gain bonuses to all actions.<br/>* All characters have epithets ("The Iron Armed; The Lion; The Liar" etc), and you can get a free "I win" per session if you play it up.<br/>So, I might get my ass kicked for saying so, but when I think about Hellas I totally think of it as an anime-style RPG: It is basically an anime style action game that focuses on character melodrama as well as high adventure in a twisted western setting, ala Fullmetal Alchemist, Samurai 7, Last Exile etc.<br/><br/>I'd say <b>OVA</b> is kind of fringe in the way that it looks at characters, but it's basically equivalent to Risus in that regard. Enough fringe to throw people off that aren't expecting it, but not enough fringe for the jaded gamer looking for something totally brand new.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
