I'm going in reverse-order from time of submission, so that I don't accidentally post drafts instead of finals.<br/><br/>Blake H aka Hexabolic:<br/>Two maps for his Exalted Dragon-Blooded game:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/goodies/rmap/contest/rweb_pcs.pdf" rel="nofollow">A PC Relationship map</a><br/>and<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/goodies/rmap/contest/rweb_scarlet_throne.pdf" rel="nofollow">A map to be used as a handout for the PCs, showing them the situation behind the throne</a><br/><br/>Comments: Very pretty, both of them. As for the second, that's some of the awesome creativity I was hoping to see in this contest.  As for me, I don't create much in the way of player handouts, session summaries and the like. However, this handout basically puts together the background situation for the players in a way that can jump-start a campaign and bring that political feud to the forefront, even more than any rules-based tricks might. You had me at "Make your move, little bitch".<br/><br/>Anemone:<br/>She has put together two R-Maps:<br/><a href="http://www.tlucretius.net/Exodus/Exodus_R-map.jpg" rel="nofollow">A picture R-Map showing the major PCs and factions for an SF game</a>.<br/>and<br/><a href="http://www.tlucretius.net/Roanoke/" rel="nofollow">A web-based Relationship map for the major characters and NPCs in a game of Roanoke</a>.<br/><br/>Comments: Interesting use of only graphics in the Exodus map.  I really like the Roanoke map, in that if you click on a face, it delves deeper showing all the relationships to the surrounding characters.  I'd love to hear if this has helped the game at all (players referencing it, etc).  Very slick.<br/><br/>Delirium<br/>Eoin has <a href="http://img167.imageshack.us/img167/8017/ptoluswhoarethepcsnpcsodu6.jpg" rel="nofollow">put together a master chart of relationships in a Ptolus campaign here</a>.<br/><br/>Comments: Very cool. I feel like I can just walk into this game as a player and start playing. I also like how there are a few NPCs and a lot of relationships gravitate towards them (the Merchant in black, frex).<br/><br/>Thomas D<br/>Thomas has an <a href="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/r_map_4.pdf" rel="nofollow">R-Map for his "Foundation" game here</a>.<br/><br/>Comments: I like!  There are several levels of organization in that map, including collecting the PCs together, identifying relationships by color, antagonists by stronger color, etc.  Also people and organizations are treated the same. Compared to the Ptolus map above, it's a little harder to imagine what the game is like, but it looks like a solid reference for players as the campaign continues and expands. Nice job.<br/><br/>Rich Stokes<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rich_at_rwb/RMap/Bromley.pdf" rel="nofollow">A Primetime Adventures Supers campaign relationship map</a><br/><br/>Comments: Sweet!  I like how both the PCs and the super-group the form are treated as a relationship, where other people and organizations have ties to them as a group, if not to the individual members. Nice setup!  I want to know more about the Happytron 5000.<br/><br/>Halfjack<br/><a href="http://www.phreeow.net/images/reign_setting.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here is the nascent R-Map for his Reign campaign</a><br/><br/>Comments: Slick!  Kinda unconventional, but just reading this is like reading a "setting guide", but visually produced rather than written by hand ("X, Y, and Z are all guilds of Uldholm", etc). It's a campaign laid bare. Very nice.<br/><br/>Also, (sorry, just noticed)<br/><a href="http://www.phreeow.net/images/tv.pdf" rel="nofollow">Halfjack provides us with an R-Map</a> of his Traveller game.<br/><br/>Comments: Hey, this is the first R-Map I've ever seen where the planets themselves are treated as relationships!  That's really compelling, and shows why the Pcs will want to wander from place to place.<br/><br/>Mike Holmes<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/goodies/rmap/mikequest.pdf" rel="nofollow">A link to Mike's ongoing HeroQuest RPG R-Map</a> which if I'm not mistaken has been going on weekly for several years?<br/><br/>Comments:  If there was a "HOLY F***!!!" award, it would go to Mike. The R-Map came up on my large monitor in 15% size, and takes up several screens. However, I can see how after several years just by looking at the names and groups, tracing over the relationships, the adventures, the background and what happened can all come flooding back. I also like how facts about the characters are there under their names, to remember exactly their "place" in the setting.  If I were producing a new version of HeroQuest with the traditional style "Here's a huge setting to work with", it would come with an expandable paper wall map of this R-Map.<br/><br/>pells<br/>A relationship map for <a href="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/relationship_map_EN.jpg" rel="nofollow">his Avalanche RPG setting</a>, converted from French.<br/><br/>Comments: Colorful!  I particularly like how there were many colors used to trace the relationships between people, groups and races. I think that was the most extensive use of color for that purpose, out of all the entries.<br/><br/>Sempiternity<br/>Provides us with THREE maps for his Burning Wheel game!<br/>"Viola - my rough sketchy drafts for Burning Wheel <b>Tageshafen</b>, after session 1 <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/space2/sempiternity/images/Tageshafen_conflict_web_1.pdf" rel="nofollow">conflict web</a>, <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/space2/sempiternity/images/Tageshafen_r-map_1.pdf" rel="nofollow">connections map</a>, and <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/space2/sempiternity/images/r-map__The_Prince_.png" rel="nofollow">relationship overview</a>. I'll be seeing if i can make the next set more functional &amp; focused!"<br/><br/>Comments: Holy NPCs Batman!  There's a lot to keep track of, and this R-Map I think does a good job of doing so.  I particularly like that their jobs are placed under their names for easy rememberance.<br/><br/>JD Corley<br/><a href="http://www.gliffy.com/publish/1194935/" rel="nofollow">A relationship map for a Supers game using the Marvel "Stones" system</a><br/><br/>Comments: Combining PC "dossiers", and real life links to real organization webpages, this is probably the most expansive R-Map.  I spent a lot of time clicking around, then jumped back to your <a href="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/gaming/tenebrous/" rel="nofollow">Tenebrous campaign page</a> to see what was going on under the surface.  To me, this smells like a very traditional setup: That is you, the GM, created a huge ton of data, info, rules and the like at the time of the birth of the campaign, and used the R-Map as another tool to perhaps start the campaign, if not just as a reference to remember who was who, and to visualize them. Without over-analyzing the thing, it's pretty brilliant. How much time was put into this?<br/><br/>Next post: Winners and Thoughts!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83936/#Comment_83936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-29T21:13:18+00:00" title="July 29, 2007  9:13PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2007 9:13PM by Andy.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Scoring:</b><br/><br/>As I mentioned in the original contest thread, I was totally going to pick them in a highly subjective way. No numbers, scores, etc. The important thing for me was to provide an opportunity for people to post their thoughts and R-Maps in a carefree manner without worrying about falling in line for some scoring categories. Plus, the prizes are small and would disappoint someone who put a lot of work into this only to win some big thing.<br/><br/>Anyway, using a combination of creativity, usefulness, composition, creativity, visual impact, "Wow" factor and, of course, creativity, I came down to the following winners.  Originally I was going to pick one, but I ended up getting two prizes so there will be two winners.  I thought a lot about my favorites of the group. A lot of effort went into them, and down to one they all rocked. <br/><b><br/>The winners:</b><br/><br/><b>BLAKE H</b>, for the Exalted Throne-War Relationship Map.<br/>If there was only one winner, this is the one I would have picked.  Why? Sure it was pretty and all that, but it really opened my eyes to interesting ways an R-Map can be used in a game.  It doesn't always have to be the PCs and the NPCs they bump into, it can be a handout to show new players What's Up in the World, in a way that gets them choosing sides, placing bets, and starting up their gaming engines trying to think of how their PC will shift or maintain the balance.  Excellent job, I was thoroughly skool'd on this whole R-Map endeavor.<br/><br/><b>JD CORLEY</b>, for the Tenebrous R-Map and campaign guide.<br/>JD was being a cocky ass :-), saying "I will win" and all that, in a cute and competitive way.  That got me personally in more of a mood as a judge to be really critical of his work, and do everything possible to make that Not Happen :-) .  And yet, after about 12 minutes I realized I was still clicking around on the thing, following links, building an idea of how the campaign is laid out in my head, and even following tertiary links to the world background and rules and the like.  The HTML/clicky format is something that can't really be brought to the table for the players to remember who is what (unless someone has a laptop), but it's undeniably thorough, engrossing, and really takes this whole R-Map thing to a new level.<br/>As a Vistual learner and not an Audial (reading text is part of audial learning) learner, I have a problem with getting into "Actual Play" reports, even if my friends are writing them in a creative way. There's no flow of time in JD's R-Map, but I feel that I'm soaking up an actual play report, laid bare visually and interspersed with text.  It really engaged my brain.<br/><br/>So, I'll be contacting Blake and JD to send them their prize: A T-Shirt shirt from Engrish.com, in size XL, one in black and one in white:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://us.st11.yimg.com/us.st.yimg.com/I/engrish-store_1948_22271409"/><br/><br/>That's right. An R-Map contest deserves <i>nothing less</i> than <b>HOT SPACE STATION JUSTICE</b>.<br/><br/><b>What Next? </b> My goal of this contest was to do one thing only: Get me (Andy) thinking about this whole R-Map business.  Is it idea nothing more than just a toy? Can it "improve" gaming? What kinds of maps can people come up with? What do R-Maps bring to the table?<br/><br/>I've done a lot of thinking about this, especially when I was going through and leaving comments.  I'll definitely be spinning off a thread or two on my thoughts. So on that front alone, the contest was a success for me!  But I hope that others watching from the sidelines, who have been curious about this whole R-Map fad, have been thinking about what they can do for them as well.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83940/#Comment_83940" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-29T21:46:35+00:00" title="July 29, 2007  9:46PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coolness!

How does it match up to your imagination of what the game was like from the R-map and the website?<br/><br/>Thank you, thank you, and of course, I told you so. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84169/#Comment_84169" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T16:43:55+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  4:43PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa!  Sweet!  Just got back from an intense weekend workshop on relationships, emotional grounding, etc.  So yeah, this kinda feels weirdly synchronized...serendipitous...affirming?  Whoa.<br/><br/>Thanks, Andy, for the comments and feedback and the award.  So many of the entries are so damn cool that I'm still in shock from this result.  I will eagerly await the shirt.<br/><br/>The challenge I've had from the beginning is that the Exalted world is pretty extensive, and the Dragon-Blooded aren't outsiders, so I had to find a way to ground the players in the big political picture in a reasonably painless manner (i.e., without handing out reams of text).  The technique would totally work for countries or organizations, and I'm intrigued by Mike RM's comments.  Production-wise, I used OmniGraffle (Mac) and selections from an altogether too large collection of digital art samples downloaded over the years.  White Wolf puts out maps of Creation in the inside cover of their big splat books, so scanning the image from the 1st Ed. Dragon-Blooded book gave me the right background image.<br/><br/>Thanks, Sophie.  You called it.  I bow down.<br/><br/>Now I'll have to collect Actual Play comments.  (Did I mention I'm using a fusion of Wushu and FATE for this game?  It's a mutant experiment.)<br/><br/>And thanks, everyone.

It essentially makes people content to serve and be helpful.  They used it to make people do favours for them happily, which started off innocently enough.  Just getting the man over the road to fetch the paper from the corner shop and "volunteer" to mow the lawn, that type of thing.  This was back in the day when The Deptford Wives were just a (relatively) innocent knitting circle and bridge club.<br/><br/>Their new leader rose to power recently and starting using the Happytron 2000 to build an army of slaves which became known as The Deptford Ninjas.  Her goal was to build a bigger, more powerful Happytron which would allow the transformation from regular Joe to Deptford Ninja to be much quicker, almost instant.  This would let her spread her influence over the entire city much quicker.<br/><br/>Since the Happytron 2000 had been built by The Original Professor Werther to impress his girlfriend, the Deptford Wives turned to one of his former students to build the more powerful version.<br/><br/>Eugene was kidnapped and forced to build a Happytron 5000 but was rescued before he could complete the project and the incomplete Happytron was destroyed.<br/><br/>Later, The Deptford Wives convinced Bull-E (another student of The Original Professor Werther) to construct an even more powerful model, the Happytron 6000 for them, which was tested at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromley" rel="nofollow">Bromley</a> Municipal Sports Centre during a Wrestlegeddon tournament.  This lead the Ultimate Justice Squad's Bromley contingent to confront them, revealing the leader of the Deptford Wives to be none other than Stan's Mum!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85778/#Comment_85778" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T09:36:44+00:00" title="August  6, 2007  9:36AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's cool, Andy. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut people should still join Indie Netgaming! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
