It was just a way to grab a bit of flash to garnish the WotC press-release announcing 5th edition.<br/><br/>The article, as has been hashed out here extensively, appeared in Tuesday's paper, Jan. 10. The image chosen for the print edition is of a few folks watching a giant d20 with shapely legs strut about, a performance by the "D20 Burlesque" troupe. I suppose in the end, gamers actually gaming wasn't hot enough to appear in the NYT (no disrespect to the skillful troupe intended).<br/><br/>Here's the interesting thing about that image: it was taken at the Soho Gallery for Digital art during the "Dungeons and Dragons: On and Ever Onward" exhibit. The exhibit involved displays of art by golden age TSR illustrator Erol Otus and several artists working from his tradition. It was also a release party for "Adventurer Conquerer King," a new game in the OSR style. Besides ACK, tables were playing original tan-box D&amp;D (run by one of Gygax's original players) and a huge table running BXD&amp;D (I was one of a dozen players at that). Also briefly present was Luke Crane of Burning Wheel and a few other indie folks.<br/><br/>What is notably absent from that gathering was any element of modern D&amp;D or anything to do with Wizards of the Coast, its corporate properties, or profits derived therefrom. It would be hard to come of with a gathering that better illustrtes the irrelavance of WotC's strategies and ambitions on people who just enjoy playing and celebrating the games or making their own.<br/><br/>Three things I take from this experience.<br/>* Somebody at the NYTimes know well in advance of the coming announcement. I really hate being reminded how much of the news-media is just a process of distributing press releases.<br/>* I am slightly miffed that WotC managed to steal hard-won publicity away from independent producers by co-opting coverage of the gallery event, even if unintentionally.<br/>*WotC's stated goal of "unifying the editions" makes good press but is laughably irrelevant to significant audiences.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354079/#Comment_354079" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-12T12:02:09+00:00" title="January 12, 2012 12:02PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2012 12:04PM by jenskot.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was also disappointed. <br/><br/>I thought it was going to be a chance to show off gamers gaming in a positive light which is why I canceled my plans for the night to attend. I'm still glad I attended because it was fun and filled with people I like. <br/><br/>To be fair, they did take a lot of pictures. But like the D&amp;D Community episode almost not happening, someone high up could have killed that aspect of the story. For all we know the original article included all the content we hoped but was cut out last second.<br/><br/>I've known people who are called up for TV interviews, asked to do hours of prep and give away free product, just to have the interview changed or cancelled minutes before the segment! <br/><br/>I've also had friends interviewed and quoted saying things they never said. One example being completely hilarious, ridiculous, and unimaginable how what was actually said could have ended up quoted the way it was. Whisper me if you want to know the details. But the point is, this happens a lot unfortunately :-(                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354152/#Comment_354152" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T08:21:49+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  8:21AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2012 8:38AM by Tavis.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No no no, we managed to steal some of WotC's carefully orchestrated spotlight and give it to local independent producers and artists! This scheme succeeded remarkably well, I think everyone involved is as happy as adventurers who have proved James_Nostack wrong by actually using the pick pockets skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The author of the NY Times piece, Ethan Gilsdorf, contacted me to get some quotes for the article. One of his questions was "where can the Times get pictures," but I answered lots of other questions knowing that he wouldn't be able to use most/all of what I said and that his editors might omit whatever was left.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ethan made sure that credit went where it was due by running a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/01/mitt-romney-as-dd-character/" rel="nofollow">piece in Wired's GeekDad blog</a>, where he does have pretty much complete control over what appears. I think it's a good idea to fill journalist-types with as much info about RPGs as possible - even if it's not immediately useful it could crop up later - but Ethan is a deep-dyed gamer and all-around good guy, I was preaching to the choir.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I likewise knew (but maybe should have been clearer in saying) that it was also possible that none of the pictures would make it in. Although I was sad when they pleased their corporate masters by using the WotC publicity photo on the initial website version of the story, I think it was actually a clever bit of subversion that for the print edition of the paper they went with the more interesting and local image.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Tim Hutchings, curator of the gallery show, can be seen in the front row of that photo and continues to be as pleased about it as you can see he was to be watching the burlesque in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/nyregion/at-the-twenty-sided-store-gamers-unleash-their-alter-egos.html" rel="nofollow">The Twenty Sided Store</a> got a profile and a slideshow in the NY/Metro region; I suggested they send a photographer out there to get pictures for the D&amp;D; piece, and they did one better and sent a reporter to do a profile as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n- One of artist Casey Jex Smith's images from the show - a portrait of Mitt Romney as a character sheet - was covered in the Huffington Post, giving him mad press with which he and his gallery, Allegra LaViola, was very pleased.<br/>\n<br/>\n- One of artist Casey Jex Smith's images from the show - a portrait of Mitt Romney as a D&amp;D; character sheet - was covered in the Huffington Post, giving him mad press with which he and his gallery Allegra LaViola was very pleased.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Soho Gallery for Digital Art, whose owner is a gamer &amp; was really glad to host gamers for these parties, was mentioned in the Times print photo caption, making him happy as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n- d20 Burlesque wasn't mentioned in the caption - I think because it is an in-joke hard to explain in so few words, whereas "Soho Gallery for Digital Art" is self-explanatory - but I think Anja and Keith are pleased as punch nonetheless. And they got to try out the Action Castle-style piece Jared Sorenson wrote for d20 Burlesque in front of a highly appreciative audience!<br/>\n<br/>\n- Glad to hear you had a good time, jenskot, that's one of the things that counts!<br/>\n<br/>\n- The other thing that counts is that this event is what brought Michael Mornard out - I've been trying to reach him ever since learning he was in NYC, with no success until now. We're all benefitting from the discussion of his playstyle in the other thread, his taking part in the D&amp;D; Documentary and being interviewed for Of Dice &amp; Men, and the resultant increase in shared knowledge of the roots of roleplaying and perspective on where we come from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty" title="Sliberty"><img alt="Sliberty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty">Sliberty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354181/#Comment_354181" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T13:27:33+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  1:27PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say I was deeply disappointed by the NYT article. At first, I was excited to see D&amp;D in the NYT, but once I started reading the article, I could practically sense the eye roll at the end of each sentence. The author is talking about a billion-dollar sales figure, but with a tone of obvious incredulity and disdain that such a product could be successful. <br><br>For example, the author notes that Steven Colbert and Vin Diesel play the game, but with the disclaimer that it has become "a hipster badge of honor." Could it be that a diverse pool of people from all different walks of life actually enjoy a fun hobby? No, they're hipsters capitalizing on a trend or nerds in disguise.<br><br>The author also pulls facts seemingly out of thin air with no citations to back them up. Is there any actual evidence that video games hurt tabletop RPG sales? "Facts" such as these are haphazardly thrown out without so much as a quote from an "expert" to back them up. Just stated as a matter of course.<br><br>I get the sense that the writer did just enough research to slap together an article, then held his nose while writing it. The fact that the pictures were used not because of their context, but just because they needed some kind of visuals to accompany the article (mostly a summary of a press release) is telling.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354183/#Comment_354183" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T13:36:17+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  1:36PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why does no one ever say that tabletop rpgs hurt video game sales?
