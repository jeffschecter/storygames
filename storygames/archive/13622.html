People walk up, find out what games are forming or mention what they want to play, and get channeled to one of the smaller (large conference room) spaces that has a few tables setup. Big spaces have more noise, and more problems with blocking walkways and such. Each smaller room has 2-3 tables in it for play.<br/><br/>GPNW had a setup like this (the entryway was a little different) and it rocked. Each room could handle a couple of groups, and it's a lot easier to negotiate sound levels when it's only one other group to contend with.<br/><br/>Coincidentally, I think the conference rooms along the 2nd floor of Embassy Suites (the ones the look down on the area we play in after hours) fit this pretty exactly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308081/#Comment_308081" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-13T17:26:10+00:00" title="January 13, 2011  5:26PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2011 5:26PM by Steve_Segedy.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts (cross-posted with Sage, who is wise):<br/><br/>The one-big-room approach is good for the spectacle of seeing what everyone is playing, but it can get pretty loud.  I'm not sure if Gen Con has any sort of alternative to that model, but if so I think it would be good.  More importantly, having something closer to the exhibitor hall would be great, as that's the center of activities during the day.  Failing that, something close to the Embassy Suites / Food court part of downtown.  People shouldn't have to work to find us.<br/><br/>Having signage and maybe even sign-up sheets would be great.  For signage I'm imagining a banner we can hang that says "Indie Games on Demand" or something obvious, perhaps with some additional information for the folks unfamiliar with the event.  A good sign will cost money, however.<br/><br/>The sign-up sheets would just be for passing messages and coordinating games- It's 11:30, the middle of a session and everybody is in a game.  Somebody writes "I will run Dread at 2pm- 4 players, sign up here!" and then goes to lunch.<br/><br/>Having the table full of ready games is good, but it's even better if there are folks who know those games and can run them.  Last year we had a lot of stuff on the table that nobody was prepared for.  Publishers- if you're releasing your game at Gen Con and want it to get play at GOD, you need to find some eager ninjas to run your game and get some advance copies in their hands. <br/><br/>Having volunteers to meet and greet is pretty important, though it is a thankless job.  If we could get enough people to do it, we could spread it out more into smaller shifts.  Maybe a whole team of people for each shift would work- they could sit and play something casual together, taking turns keeping on eye on the door and talking to interested folks. <br/><br/>The best way to get Gen Con to give us better space and more amenities is to show them we can bring the fun for a lot of folks.  That means tickets getting purchased and collected at GOD games.  Maybe the best way for us to do that is to buy the tickets ourselves and then re-sell them to folks at the tables.  Maybe we pull IPR or groups of publishers together as sponsors and buy tickets, making the games free to play.  Alternately, we could go through traditional Gen Con paths and simply sponsor the event outright for a few thousand dollars, in the same way that the crafts room, Cardhalla and other activities are handled.  <br/><br/>In any case, we should also talk it up and let folks know its a great place to find out about new games and have a blast.<br/><br/>(As a side note, I say all of this as a publisher and an advocate of small press games like ours.  I want more people, new to story games, to find Games on Demand.  That may not be what everybody wants for GOD, and that's cool.

(Or cobble one together if we have to, it's months away.)<br/>Assemble one copy of each into a few binders.<br/><br/>Prospective players can flip through and pick what they want to see.  Or can be guided through it by the guy/girl/hostess/maitre d at the front table.<br/><br/><b>GAME PACKS</b><br/><br/>I love that idea.  Keep everything you need to run the game in manilla folders, so a GM just has to grab a pack and a table.  Maybe even a bag for the dice, or just a shopping list so you can grab them from a larger stash.<br/><br/><b>GAME SPACE</b><br/><br/>I was in the Omni two years ago, second floor on the right.  The room had really high ceilings, and as far as conventions go, it was one of the quieter rooms I have gamed in.  Backgrund noise levels are worth mentioning, but I think anyone trying a game out at a convention knows the hazards.  The idea here is to give people a taste, right?  Hopefully they will be excited enough to take these games home and play them in a more controlled environment.<br/><br/><b>VOLUNTEER</b><br/><br/>If I'm still in the country, I'll be there with bells on.  I said I would do this all day, and I mean it.  I might, however, be overseas if I land this job prospect.  Unless I can host games over a skype connection, I would have to decline.<br/><br/>I will know in about a month.<br/><br/><b>THANKLESS JOB</b><br/><br/>It's hard being the meet and greet guy, but it's necessary.  That initial enthusiasm, and that first responder to interest and questions is the best way to convince the casual interest to sit down and commit.  If it seems thankless, I will personally thank anyone who takes a shift.  It really does help.  Maybe this is where we should focus some attention?  This isn't really a job where we can incentivise someone into this, but maybe something else?<br/><br/><b>CHEAP TRICKS</b><br/><br/>It's worth mentioning that over the weekend I used a parking garage and I got change in dollar coins.  EVERYONE I have talked to all week has asked me where I got them.  Perhaps if we made change with those, it would increase traffic?  I only say this because seriously, it got people talking.  I have every confidence that we can show people the awesome that is the games, but anything to get the conversation <i>started</i> is worth it.<br/><br/>A few years ago there were maps/flyers at some of the booths?

A good sign will cost money, however.<br/><br/>The sign-up sheets would just be for passing messages and coordinating games- It's 11:30, the middle of a session and everybody is in a game.

But it seems to me like it's easier to get people to try things when there isn't a schedule.  I've seen people sit and wait for an hour and a half for a scheduled game, (when we could have easily played through a short demo of something else in that time) because they were afraid they'd miss it.<br/>Maybe if the organizer/greeter has this info, but doesn't necessarily pass it on?

Just to break the silence, we've been in contact with both Peter Adkison and Derek Guder about making Games On Demand a formal part of Gencon, including space inside the convention center itself. Now, in order to do that, we do have to monetize the operation- renting a room of our preferred size for the show ourselves for it to be free to play would be in the neighborhood of $1800-2400, which doesn't seem likely to be raisable. So, we're looking at the interest in having $2 ticket costs per game slot. Further, Gencon itself would be much more comfortable with some level of defined slots of games in advance- I think we can probably finess this with "one of this set of games will be played, based on player demand, at times X, Y and Z," but that's still being discussed. So let's open the question to the floor- are you interested in this, what do you want GoD to work like, and are these sorts of compromises worth the convenience, con support and access to great swaths of new potential players? Or would you prefer to keep this an informal, unsupported event off-site? dw                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311684/#Comment_311684" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T10:15:55+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 10:15AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How wonderful.

Maybe the primary small press vendor booths and publishers (IPR, Pelgrane, Bully Pulpit, etc.) could buy in to make sure there's a table for their new hotness, while the other tables are free for unscheduled games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311702/#Comment_311702" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T11:28:15+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 11:28AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, nice work Darren, that sounds great. I think tickets are fine, especially if it moves Games on Demand to a more prime location. If it helps with cost, I even think being placed in one of the more connected hotels (Embassy Suites, that one where the True Dungeon is, etc.) would be fine too. Just moving to someplace that people can walk to without planning their day around it would be a win.<br/><br/>How cool would the GenCon folks be with defining slots as "Games will start at x am, y pm, and z pm, but games may start at other times as well." The upside I can see to this is it makes it easier to hit that critical mass: there will be a big wave of people at x, y, and z, so games can actually get started.<br/><br/>A list of games being played is probably needed, but it's also a little tricky. I mean, for example, I can throw down Lady Blackbird at a moment's notice if someone wanted it, but I wouldn't list it as one of my top options. I can see any list being both too long to easily skim and still incomplete for what is actually available. Still, if it helps define what Games on Demand actually is, it's probably worth it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311717/#Comment_311717" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T12:06:27+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 12:06PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm down with this model.

That'd be for a "standard" (by Gencon terminology) 2-hour slot. If some games for whatever reason don't work well in a 2-hour slot, we may be able to bundle more than one together (for the short demos) or just fill more than one slot (for a 4-hour game if that seemed best.) Which means a dedicated person to handle cash on site at all times- IPR is willing to provide this.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Doing it ourselves with Kickstarter has already been brought up as a possibility. I myself would prefer to have Gencon buy in on this, for today and the future, because my main goal is frankly exposure to new players. However, I like having that there as a Plan B in case Gencon turns out to be too hard to work with. So far, so good; it helps that Peter's a fan of a lot of these games. <br/>\n<br/>\n3) We'll definitely have a standard for what games are run- anybody looking for Pathfinder can find it easily at the show. I'm presuming the bulk of the games we'll make available will be from IPR or fellow indie travelers; I'm picturing a single big poster or something in the room listing what we have in the GoD "library," as well as a schedule that has dedicated slots ("Table #5: Annalise from 12-4"), more flexible ones ("Table #3: GM Jane Doe will be running one (or more) of these four games from 12 to 4 based on votes"), and purely pickup one ("Table #2: Open gaming from 12-4, sign up on the white board.") <br/>\n<br/>\n4) Steve, I'm totally down with publishers or whoever sub-sponsoring a table within the show, for a set time or for the whole thing. A Bully Pulpit-dedicated table where Fiasco, Roach and/or Grey Ranks is always going on would be tres cool. Or more than one could team up to share a dedicated table. Would there be interest in that? <br/>\ndw                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311767/#Comment_311767" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T15:12:34+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  3:12PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe we can use Kickstarter even if Gen Con buys in.

Even if it was just a sponsored time slice at a table, that is a great idea.<br/><br/>Also, I'm going to try to subdivide and catagorize the stuff I offer at the small conventions leading up to summer.  I'll post feedback as I learn what works and doesn't, possibly on another thread.<br/><br/>One of the things that really worked for Rio Grande Games last year was demos.  They gave you a ribbin for your badge for every demo you played, and if you collected enough of them, they gave you a discount at their store.<br/><br/>I don't want to sound too sales and marketing, but maybe if people played a number of games over at GoD, got stamps or whatever, they could get discounts to specific books or something?  Play all the Bully Pulpit offerings, get some cool exclusive Fiasco playset.  Is that too gimmicky?  The profit margins seem likely higher on boardgames, but I'm speaking from total ignorance here.  Maybe it's a bad idea.

I'm afraid this will be rather rambling.<br/><br/>The first doubt is about being tethered to a table. Last year, I would happily have run Trail demos at Games on Demand. The problem was: Games on Demand was much, much too noisy. There's no way I could have run a decent Cthulhu game there. So, I'd like the freedom to gather people together and go wherever we want, without the pressure to run it at a specific table.<br/><br/>The second doubt is about the pressure to keep a game running. If Company X pays for a table, then there's a pressure to keep that game running with Company X games. That eats into some of the freedom of Games on Demand. Rather than standing around saying "What would we like to play?", there'll be a GM rostered on to Company X's Table, and a pressure to get players on to that table. <br/><br/>That'll be fine with, say, Dresden Files. There'll be a neverending stream of people who <i>want</i> to run and play that. But with smaller games, I'm not sure.<br/><br/>A third doubt: let's say Company X pays for a table. What happens when it's not in use? Does it stand empty: "You can't use that, it's the Company X table"? Or do you use it? If so, what happens if Company X suddenly wants to run a demo there: "Move along, guys, this is the Company X table"?<br/><br/>None of this is insoluble, but it needs thinking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312005/#Comment_312005" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T06:44:20+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  6:44AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was imagining something a little less concrete with sponsoring, Graham. In my mind, the table wouldn't be exclusive to a sponsor, and volunteers wouldn't be mandated to pimp that sponsor's games. The sponsor pays to help make GoD happen in general, which gets their name/logo on the sign and maybe into the program. They can arrange for more volunteers to make sure there are people who know their games, and they can advertise that their games are at GoD. But if no one wants to play that game, by all means, run something else.<br/><br/>With that in mind, while Evil Hat might want to sponsor and find volunteers to keep Dresden running all day and night, smaller companies and designers might work together to keep a host of games running, sort of like Design Matters did last year.<br/><br/>This raises another thought from last year- it seems like small "snack-sized" games are useful at GoD; games you can play while you're waiting for a game to start, for enough players to show up, or for a table to clear.  Zombie Cinema worked like this a bit last year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312097/#Comment_312097" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T14:06:15+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  2:06PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Steve on this one.
