It's pretty loosely based because I didn't want to concern myself too much with adhering to all the minutiae of the Underground setting, but I kept a lot of the key points, emphasized the ones that were important to me, and stole a few details while using the rest as inspiration. The premise is basically this:<br/><br/>An alien spaceship crash-landed on earth. The spaceship itself was the result of extremely advanced bioengineering. Using the remains of the spaceship, humanity was able to reverse engineer this bioengineering and used it to develop superhumans. This bioengineering was done primarily by corporations, and in the early experiments the test subjects went completely insane. Going to sleep normal and waking up with superpowers was too much to bear. So, a deep sleep subconscious programming component was introduced in which during their time in the reeingineering tanks they would dream a second life in which they were in four-color comics, growing up with superpowers and fighting bad guys.<br/><br/>The corporations leased out the created superhumans to fight in wars for various governments. This was the trade-off. Want superpowers and a healthy amount of money? Just dip into our bioengineering tanks, spend a couple years fighting in a war, and then you're all set. The wars were brutal, as all our, and when the superhuman soldiers returned home they had a host of other problems.<br/><br/>The results of the bioengineering is an unavoidable mental instability. The Dreamland scenarios keep the humans from immediately going insane, but there's a slow degradation over time. Combine that with PTSD, and many of the superhuman veterans find themselves with crippling mental issues. Many end up homeless, some in prison, and some dead after deadly encounters with cops or some of the new task forces created to deal with mentally unstable superhumans should they become violent.<br/><br/>In some, this causes their Dreamland programming to speak louder. The morality they learned living a false life in four colors makes right and wrong very clear, and the government and the corporations are as evil as any supervillain. The Underground formed - a loose collection of veterans who take action to overthrow and destroy the government and the corporations and rid the world of their corruption.<br/><br/>If you can get your hands on the original Underground book, that would communicate the tone and setting a lot better than I can. It's pretty gonzo dystopic. A good inspiration would be Transmetropolitan. It's a weird mixture of cyberpunk and over the top, dark humor, like if Garth Ennis tried to do superhuman cyberpunk.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166636/#Comment_166636" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T11:54:02+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 11:54AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Madness(5)<br/>-------<br/>PTSD +0 - The government offers limited access to counselling and prescription drugs for returning vets, but it's often not enough and those who need it the most have little to know access to it. Flashbacks are common, and many vets find themselves dealing with anger and violence issues.<br/>Superpower Psychoses +0 - The current wave of veterans and superhumans are some of the earliest subjects of the experiments. Long-term consequences of bioengineering are just being seen, and the biggest one is mental degradation. All vets find themselves dealing with mental illnesses from catatonia to homicidal mania. The severity seems to vary in accordance to the degree of bioengineering done (someone who can lift tanks and fly will have a much harder time than someone who can cause matchsticks to levitate) and whether crippling insanity is inevitable for all vets remains to be seen.<br/>Dreamland Hallucinations +0 - As the vets degrade, the subconscious programming they received while they were in Dreamland rises to the surface. Sometimes this is subtle like a greater sense of responsibility to stop injustice, and in other cases the vet will experience delusions that they are actually in a four color comic.<br/><br/>Revolution(5)<br/>----------<br/>The Underground +0 - The Underground is a loose organization of veterans acting independently or in small cells to overthrow the corporations and the government. They have been designated a terrorist organization by the Central Federal Bureau of Homeland Intelligence and Security who is desperately hunting for the known ringleader, Major Victory. The Underground uses a snake on a green field as their emblem with the words "Don't you dare tread on me," as their motto.<br/>Modern primitives +0 - As a backlash against invasive technology and pop culture, a neo-primitive movement has emerged and become rather successful. Some seek to live a life as back-to-nature as possible, while others actively seek to destroy and dismantle technology. Individuals in the movement disdain technology to varying degrees which can make it rather fractious (some might argue that using a handheld missile launcher to destroy a DOOKIE COLA billboard is acceptable, while others would disagree).<br/>Corrupt government +0 - Politicians on corporate payrolls. Cops on criminal payrolls. The entire institution crushing down on the backs of the common man.<br/><br/>Technology(2)<br/>----------<br/>Omnipresent and perverse pop culture +0 - DOOKIE COLA: I can't believe it's recycled waste! ESTRO-GIN: When alcohol isn't enough! TASTEE GHOUL: It's made of people! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>Bioengineering +0 - The advanced bioengineering that was originally used to create the superhumans is still being used, and is also utilized in smaller doses on a day to day basis. The rich are living longer and longer lives, and are able to easily and (sort of) painlessly cosmetically re-engineer their bodies.<br/>Alien technology +0 - Apart from bioengineering, alien technology has been introduced in weapons systems, artificial intelligence (robots are now commonplace), communications, and other aspects of life. The future is now! Welcome to the land of tomorrow!<br/><br/>Poverty(3)<br/>-------<br/>Homelessness +0 - The population has grown, jobs are being taken by robots, and living space is at a premium. Slum lords are able to rent out sleeping space in stairwells (thanks to the Better Housing Act recently passed by Congress), and vets returning from wars find themselves financially and/or mentally unable to locate a place to stay.<br/>Crime +0 - The typical types of crime still thrive, but as conditions have worsened and the technology has changed new forms emerge. Neo-slavery is alive and thriving. As corporations develop ways to utilize brain cells in computing, a black market has grown for brainjacking (innocent victims are murdered and have their brain, or entire heads if the jackers are in a rush, removed), and gangs roam streets where the cops can't (or just plain won't) go.<br/>Black markets +0 - As the prices on necessary items and services are jacked up by corporations, a market has grown for black market nutrition, medical services, drugs, and so on. Weapons are purchased by individuals who live in neighborhoods that can't afford to be protected by the cops. And, as always, darker products and services are available because they're simply illegal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166637/#Comment_166637" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T11:54:39+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 11:54AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Killowatt (Real Name: Cokie Jamboree)<br/>---------<br/>Everyone knew Killowatt. Always smiling, always joking, even when things were bloody and dark. She found a way to keep us going no matter how hard things got in that fucked up war. Everyone felt it when she took a sniper's bullet to the throat. We all remember her. Many of us still see her in our dreams. And a few of us see her when we're awake...<br/>(Bret's notes: I use Killowatt in flashbacks, but I like to play with the idea that she might still be, in some sense, alive. Energy cannot be destroyed, and given her power over electricity...)<br/>Concept: Outsider<br/>Motifs: Aura 4, Birthright 0, Freedom 4, Insight 4<br/>Powers: Aura (Crackles with Energy +0, Inspires Hope +1), Freedom (Transform into electricity +2, Nothing gets me down +0), Insight (Pep talks +1, Electrical Bolt +1)<br/>Archetype: The Fool (5)<br/>Shadow: Knows that she's going to die.<br/>Bond: Arnie, her boyfriend back home +6, a small village boy in the war +5<br/>Issue: I want to get myself and everyone else through this mess without giving in to the darkness.<br/>Drive: I came to this place because I wanted to live a life of adventure.<br/>Obligation: I promised Arnie that I'd come home to him and marry him.<br/>Artist Guidelines: Spiky blond hair, fingerless gloves, striped socks.<br/>Writers Guidelines: Perky, intelligent, jokester.<br/><br/>Red Owl (used to be Fire Baldwin) Real Name: Brom Bromson<br/>---------------------------------<br/>After returning home from the war, Red Owl was looking for something to give his life meaning. The neo-primitive movement spoke to him, so he joined and quickly found the skills he gained surviving in the jungles to be prized. He stepped up as a leader, and after the birth of his son he's begun stepping up his tribe's violent actions.<br/>Concept: Adept<br/>Motifs: Art 3, Craft 3, Ritual 3, Status 3<br/>Powers: Art (Flaming Fist +0, Disappear into the Wild +1), Craft (Stockpile +1, Make Primitive Tools and Weapons +0), Ritual (Plan Terrorist Attack +0, Archery +0), Status (Primitivist Leader +1, Mind Control +0)<br/>Archetype: Hermit 7<br/>Shadow: Violent rejection of all things technological.<br/>Bonds: Brave Bird, son +6, White Owl, brother +6<br/>Issue: I am afraid of what humanity is becoming in the grip of this new technology.<br/>Drive: I must unmake all modern technology or it will destroy all of us.<br/>Obligation: I promised my son I would make a better world for him.<br/>Artist's Guidelines: Red feather in hair, warpaint, necklace made of teeth of questionable origin.<br/>Writer's Guidelines: Stoic, laconic, quick to act.<br/><br/>Yellen Vansling<br/>---------------<br/>A young scientist when the spaceships crashed, Yellen made the most profound breakthroughs during the early research. She's praised as one of the greatest minds of the modern age, and seeks to expand the role of the alien technology in day-to-day life. However, she sees some of the ways the advanced technology has made things worse, and makes it her goal to improve things for all mankind.<br/>Concept: Adept<br/>Motifs: Art 3, Craft 3, Ritual 3, Status 3<br/>Powers: Art (Supergenius +1, Planned for this eventuality +0), Craft (Laboratory +0, New Gadgets +0), Ritual (Research +0, Genetic redesign +1), Status (World-famous scientist +1, Friends in high places +0)<br/>Archetype: Magician 7<br/>Shadow: Fixated on work<br/>Bonds: Project Alpha, mad bioengineering subject +6, Gramble, lab assistant +6<br/>Issue: The world is depending on me to make it a better place.<br/>Drive: I have this genius and I must use it for the greater good.<br/>Obligation: Project Alpha is my mistake and taking care of him now is my responsibility.<br/>Artist's Guidelines: Labcoat at all times, hair in a bun, glasses.<br/>Writer's Guidelines: Distracted, remorseful, driven.<br/><br/>Supermandible (Real Name: Tiger Bluffton)<br/>-------------<br/>One of the most notorious members of the Underground, Supermandible is responsible for the DOOKIE COLA Boardroom Massacre which left thirteen executives dead with the words "MY MISERY HATES YOUR COMPANY" spraypainted on a boardroom wall. While his actions are praised, even other members of the Underground have found him difficult to deal with, but none doubt his commitment or his prowess.<br/>Concept: Vigilante<br/>Motifs: Mania 3, Prowess 3, Presence 3, Territory 3<br/>Powers: Mania (Don't Tread On Me! +0, Requires no sleep +0), Prowess (Piles of Guns +1, Superhuman physical qualities +1), Presence (Graffiti +0, Infamous Underground member +1), Territory (Uses the subways and sewers +0, Underground contacts +0)<br/>Archetype: Warrior 7<br/>Shadow: Going insane.<br/>Bonds: Homicidal Brainiac, amputee vet +6, Kahlua, mother +6<br/>Issue: The government has become the greatest villain of all and must be brought to justice.<br/>Drive: I swore to all my brothers and sisters who died in that stupid war that I'd kill everyone responsible.<br/>Obligation: Homicidal Brainiac saved my life and I'll do anything I Can for him.<br/>Artist's Guidelines: Giant metal jaw, tons of guns, snake emblem.<br/>Writer's Guidelines: Agitated, always in motion, irritable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166638/#Comment_166638" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T11:54:54+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 11:54AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Murderous Murderess (Real Name: Shell Graves)<br/>-------------------<br/>It is a rare few vets that enjoy and indulge in the madness and darkness that their powers and time in the war visited on them. Murderous Murderess is one of those. Initially a run-of-the-mill serial killer after her return, she was quickly discovered by a local crime lord and put to work.<br/>Concept: Vampire<br/>Motifs: Domination 0, Hunger 0, Preternatural 6, Transformation 6<br/>Powers: Preternatural (Invisible in the Shadows +1, Superspeed +0, Climb up walls +1), Transformation (Claws +2, Long paralyzing tongue +0, Moveable bone structure +0)<br/>Archetype: Moon 6<br/>Shadow: Going insane.<br/>Bonds: Akira Kinse, boss +9<br/>Issue: Now that the war is over, I have to find a new way to find the violence I grew to love.<br/>Drive: Something inside me compels me to kill.<br/>Obligation: Akira gives me direction and targets, which helps to keep me from being captured or neturalized.<br/>Artist's Guidelines: Always in black, face obscured, long horrible claws.<br/>Writer's Guidelines: Sick, prone to violence, sexualizes death.<br/><br/>Major Victory<br/>-------------<br/>Major Victory is a construct programmed into the Dreamland scenarios. He was designed to be a mentor to the incubating superheroes, teaching them about their powers, and is based on the superheroes of the ancient four-color comics. His role in the Dreamland scenarios has been all-but-forgotten, and now as the vets mental states' worsen they speak of a Major Victory who urges them to strike for justice against the government and the corporations. The government now hunts him down intently, but has yet to find him.<br/>(Bret's Notes: Major Victory, like Killowatt, is used as a hallucination. It took some bending of Darkpages to make him work, I think, but so far my player kind of loves and kind of hates him. He's a complete ripoff of a Tony LB Capes character right down to his toothy grin and catch phrases, but I think that was Major Glory and I incorrectly remembered the name.)<br/>Concept: Elemental<br/>Motifs: Affinity 0, Consciousness 10, Domain 0, Embodiment 2<br/>Powers: Consciousness (Locate instances of injustice +0, Inspire courage +0, Possession +0), Embodiment (Wright wrongs +0)<br/>Archetype: Sun 7<br/>Shadow: Not real<br/>Bonds: George Washington +5<br/>Issue: With great power comes great responsibility.<br/>Drive: Truth, justice, and the American way.<br/>Obligation: Our forefathers created this country to offer us great freedom and opportunity.<br/>Artist's Guidelines: Red white and blue, V-for victory hand gesture, sparkling teeth.<br/>Writer's Guidelines: Patriotic, inspiring, a little weird.<br/><br/>Cyber-Busey<br/>-----------<br/>As early use of alien technology drove its subjects completely insane and the Dreamland scenarios had yet to be completed, researchers found other subjects that were able to withstand the experimentation physically and mentally - individuals that were cryogenically frozen back in the 21st century. The thawing process left them with no personalities, no memories, and a very limited capability for thought and cognitive processing, but they were able to take commands. One of the more successful experiments was Cyber-Busey. However, these thawed humans could not successively adapt to wartime environments and the loss of all the Cyber-Baldwins in an early engagement led to them being used in simpler tasks. Cyber-Busey has been outfitted with armor plating and high-powered weaponry and is used in engagements with dangerous and mentally ill veterans who are often unable to come up with complex tactics. He's also enjoying success as a write-in candidate for governor of the recently-renamed Colafornia.<br/>Concept: Construct<br/>Motifs: Assimilation 2, Function 5, Form 5, Interface 0<br/>Powers: Assimilation (Running for Office +0), Function (Weapon and Targeting Systems +1, Superhuman Tracking Device +1), Form (Exoskeleton +1, Immune to Pain +0)<br/>Archetype: The Void 7<br/>Shadow: No personality or memory.<br/>Bonds: Ambien Truman, scientist +5, Weng Busey, great great great grandson +5<br/>Issue: I have been programmed to hunt down and destroy all who threaten the government.<br/>Drive: I think and feel nothing and will do as I am told.<br/>Obligation: Ambien returned me to life and I will do anything for him.<br/>Artist's Guidelines: Big teeth, gray skin, covered in armor plates.<br/>Writer's Guidelines: Deadpan, robotic, terminator-like relentlessness.<br/><br/>Sellbot<br/>-------<br/>Sellbot was programmed to buy buy buy and sell sell sell. He escaped from his corporate masters and is now a successful black market overlord. He likes cats.<br/>Concept: Construct<br/>Motifs: Assimilation 3, Function 3, Form 3, Interface 3<br/>Powers: Assimilation (Always looking for a bargain +1, Loves cats +1), Function (Locate any good on the planet +1, Offload hot goods +1), Form (Evade police capture +1, Many spindly arms +0), Interface (Global networking system +0, Connect to government systems +0)<br/>Archetype: The Wheel 5<br/>Shadow: Has no understanding of morality.<br/>Bonds: Treessa, crazy cat lady +6, Harv, robot repairman +6<br/>Issue: Someday some goods or information will come into my hand that will help me find a purpose beyond my programming.<br/>Drive: I want to become something greater than a robot.<br/>Obligation: Treessa treats me like a human, and so I try to spend time with her as often as I can.<br/>Artist's Guidelines: Many long arms, tank treads, monocular eye.<br/>Writer's Guidelines: Can very casually do horrific things, advanced intelligence, very protective of cats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166694/#Comment_166694" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T16:49:59+00:00" title="September  2, 2008  4:49PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hee!
