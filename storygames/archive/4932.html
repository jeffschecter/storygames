I've learned so much from the whole process and gotten some cool characters to boot. I'd like to consolidate the comments and feedback from both groups into this thread, so you can both compare notes n' such. I have a couple questions:\n<ul>\n<li>There were some private comments discussing a general writer's block or spotlight paralysis during the second step when you were writing about other player's characters. Do you have any ideas for how to resolve this speedbump?</li>\n<li>Characters in both threads ranged from the familiar to the exotic. How do think this process handles "normal" characters in comparison to characters with a supernatural background?</li>\n<li>It was very loose in both threads, but the character creation process was ostensibly framed around your characters actually being questioned by the temple's elders. Once it's more refined, do you think this framing device is helpful or distracting, in terms of helping you create interesting characters?</li>\n<li>There was a fair amount of collaboration during the whole process.

Do you have any ideas for how to resolve this speedbump?</blockquote> Examples, and possibly for the very hard up, a table of "suggested" remembrances of other characters, with a strongly worded encouragement to make up and/or customize some of your own (and examples using remembrances not in the list).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Characters in both threads ranged from the familiar to the exotic. How do think this process handles "normal" characters in comparison to characters with a supernatural background?</blockquote>\nThe example characters in the older playtest document included some fantasy elements, which might have had an effect.  And it is a somewhat fantastic setting, after all -- particularly the whole power thing.  Additionally, experienced players of role-playing games (which you had) might well have a bias toward inserting fantastic elements anyway.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>It was very loose in both threads, but the character creation process was ostensibly framed around your characters actually being questioned by the temple's elders.

Answering questions encourages first person responses which I find immersive (and I consider that a good thing).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>There was a fair amount of collaboration during the whole process. By the end of it, did you have more investment in your character or in someone else's?</blockquote>\nI felt more invested in my character than anyone else's, but I found it neat to have influenced other people's characters so much.  In general, I liked how the characters' nature seemed to emerge from the group process.  I'm not sure how much the process was influenced by the medium -- I don't know to what extent the process would have been different if it had been performed face-to-face.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>It feels like the process ends rather abruptly. Do you have any advice on how to transition character creation into actual play?</blockquote>\nMaybe they could overlap, somehow?  Maybe the process of preparing the letter is combined with the process of finishing the characters so by the time the character is finished, you have just started playing the letter?  And maybe, each letter you answer changes the character at least slightly?<br/><br/>Anyway, I rather enjoyed the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110608/#Comment_110608" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T07:44:37+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  7:44AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think part of it depends on how diverse you want the various worlds to be, since the characters are from the worlds.  You set up very open-ended guidelines for writing letters, which means the worlds are super diverse.  I thought, briefly about creating a character that was, like, a war machine programmed solely for killing or something equally ridiculous.  If you don't want players to do that, I think you need some way of putting some informal guidelines on either 1) the diversity of worlds (which I think might be easier) or 2) the kinds of people / things / war machines that are accepted into the Temple.<br/><br/>I felt we needed more guidelines for constructing memories.  Many of them didn't seem to be in first person, or seem to be things that a specific character would have remembered, instead being just general images.  I think they worked less well and didn't have the power of Dogs' initiations, where actual characters are doing actual things.  Even if you made the purpose clearer, though, I think it's still going to lack the immediacy of Dogs' initial scenes, because other people are describing your character do things instead of you getting the chance to actually play your character and explore them before play starts.  That's fine, but something to think about.  I'm trying to imagine a situation where the other players frame little mini-scenes for you, based on their memories, but where you still get to play your character.  But I'm not sure if that would work, unless the framers were able to dictate the outcome to a certain extent.  It might just be worse, for your purposes, than what you already have here.<br/><br/>I think the process ended abruptly because we didn't have another task to perform.  If the next step is going straight into the letters and playing out the first world, then I think there is something missing: an introductory scene or scenes where we actually get to play our characters before they arrive on some distant world.  Like, if this was a TV series, the pilot probably wouldn't start with the characters arriving on a distant world (or, if it did, there would be some structure in place to introduce the characters, their mission, and the Temple through flashbacks or some other method).  Like, if I was GMing the game, I'd want to start with a scene that was like... Character A hears that they are going to be assigned to a group of pilgrims, and they go to inform Characters B + C.  I'd want to see the characters react a bit to being placed on a crew together, to show off their relationships with each other ("Oh a team with HIM?!  Gross!").  Or maybe there's a scene of them flying through the clouds, on the way to the first world (are there traveling scenes in this game, like there are in Avatar with everyone on Appa's back, complaining about how they have no food or have been bored for weeks?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111697/#Comment_111697" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T15:22:03+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  3:22PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, guys. I wanted to take some time to consider a resolution to Jonathan's comments in particular.<br/><br/><br/>RE: Diversity: I've been trying not to limit the diversity of the worlds. Still, addressing the potential for wildly divergent characters would be valuable when I write up the next document. I've been planning to do that anyway, but now I'll devote a bit more wordcount to the subject. I think example characters will do a lot to focus the theme as well. <br/><br/><br/>RE: Immediacy: I can totally see the problem of a lack of immediacy in the proceedings. I'm wondering if it would be helpful to move the entire process to the present tense. Instead of remembering times when  your companions proved their merits, you frame a challenge for them to overcome.<br/><br/>Instead of "I remember when Shifting Winds took a shortcut through the deadly thorn-gardens." You would frame a scene where Shifting Winds has some need to take that shortcut, but let the player make the decision.<br/><br/>I think I was being self-conscious in avoiding treading ground covered by Dogs, but I may just be trying to fix something that ain't broke.<br/><br/><br/>RE: Transition: The next thing after this process would be world creation, which presently takes the form of flying to their next destination and wondering out loud, in-character, what they'll see. I don't know if this is enough of a transition from character creation into actual play, but I hope some actual playtesting will help clear that up.<br/><br/>I do like the idea of a final step of character creation being some in-character introduction, but I wonder how can I structure that sort of scene so it's not an awkward prompt like, "You all meet in a tavern, now role-play for a little bit before we go raid the dungeon."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112837/#Comment_112837" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T13:38:56+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  1:38PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to answer these out of order.  I'm kicking myself for not answering sooner.\n<blockquote>There was a fair amount of collaboration during the whole process.

It was about on-par with my experience with Spirit of the Century.\n<blockquote>Characters in both threads ranged from the familiar to the exotic.

Perhaps the more "mundane" the character is, the less inspiration some folks will have in talking about that person -- and it also felt like, for me, that if a character started out as rather "normal" (like Justin's), that that normalcy was important to him and I felt a bit weird about trying to write about memorable moments with his character.\n<blockquote>There were some private comments discussing a general writer's block or spotlight paralysis during the second step when you were writing about other player's characters. Do you have any ideas for how to resolve this speedbump?</blockquote>\nMore inspiration hooks.  I think I mentioned to you privately of adding another question at the end of the first phase, and having that question be a follow-up the GM says rather than a scripted chargen one.  That could help to bring out more inspiration hooks.\n<blockquote>It was very loose in both threads, but the character creation process was ostensibly framed around your characters actually being questioned by the temple's elders.

It serves the character as a Rite of Passage.  Perhaps these kids need a Rite of Passage to mark them as ready to leave the Temple.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
