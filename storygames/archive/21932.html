                    Hi everyone!<br/><br/>I've been quiet for a while here, and I apologise for previously, when my notifications weren't working. I'm going to make a proactive effort this time, just in case it repeats.<br/><br/>However, I have something that might interest some of you! It's our entry for Zine Quest on Kickstarter: The Era Zone (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shadesofvengeance/the-era-zone?ref=wnse1p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shadesofvengeance/the-era-zone?ref=wnse1p</a>).<br/><br/>It's got material for all our games, plus the chance to get hold of them at a reduced price as a bundle... but it's probably more interesting (in my opinion) for the setting-neutral Sci-Fi Bestiary I'm trying to increase in size.<br/><br/>I think there are a lot of fantasy bestiaries, but I've seen very few based in Sci-Fi universes. I've tried to write entries which work in Star Wars, Star Trek, BSG, Blakes 7, etc... and Era: The Consortium, of course!<br/><br/>Basically, these are supposed to work in basically any Sci-Fi universe you want. And I think that's pretty cool, plus it's something I would want myself that I've not really been able to find.<br/><br/>So, if you're interested, please check out the link: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shadesofvengeance/the-era-zone?ref=wnse1p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shadesofvengeance/the-era-zone?ref=wnse1p</a><br/><br/>And if you have any questions, please ask away!<br/> </div>
