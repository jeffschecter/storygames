They have a base and snazzy uniforms and a Trouble-Alert screen and all that.<br/><br/>But what's the deal with this situation -- do they just hang out at the base until someone calls with an emergency? Maybe they go out on patrol sometimes and spot trouble as it happens. Either way, it seems like they're reactive. The bad guys are the ones who initiate the action.<br/><br/>I know some of you have played lots and lots of Supers games (I'm looking at you, Storn). Is this reactive mode of play the norm? Are there other ways to set up a classic superhero team situation that lets the team be more proactive?<br/><br/>Of course, I have my own ideas about how to address this, but I'm very keen to hear from people with actual play experience in Justice League style games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196957/#Comment_196957" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-14T16:43:05+00:00" title="March 14, 2009  4:43PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're going for a traditional supers game, then the answer boils down to, "Yes." <br/><br/>If you're going for a "people with superpowers" game, then the answer is, "They're just as reactive as regular people, maybe more so if they know what's going on thanks to their powers." <br/><br/>As far as I'm aware, there's no superhero game I'm aware of that postulates the heroes being proactive.

I'm not sure.  <br/><br/>At the end of a 15 year long game, my main PC (I did have several and that help keep the world fresh for all of us)... was terraforming Mars and spoke to Presidents and Premieres.  His power politically far outreached his actual superpowers.  Of course, having an alien invasion in the next 10 years called for a lot of coalition building.  <br/><br/>I was never so interested in punching stuff as I was interested in power, and what can you do with it.

But it's not like crimes are all as cut and dried as catch the bad guy in the act and deal with them. Sometimes you've got to investigate, track down leads, collect bobbleheads. You've got to figure out whodunit, and where they are before you can go nail them. Maybe you've even got to find evidence for court.. As Lex Luthor points out in Superman Returns, the boy in blue was good at catching bad guys, not so good at showing up for court.. And unless you're the killer sort of vigilante, the word of a superhero isn't always going to be good enough to convict a criminal and put 'em away for good. That's reactive, but it's proactively reactive, rather than passively reactive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you may have a personal agenda. Maybe you're out to shut down organized crime, as in Batman Begins. It may not be because of a specific incident, just because it's the right thing to do, and the cops are helpless to do it themselves. Maybe you know that the Villain of Vaudeville is up to something, and you need to stop it BEFORE it happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196965/#Comment_196965" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-14T17:40:26+00:00" title="March 14, 2009  5:40PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Post-60s comics tend to depict superhero reactiveness as more of a coincidence brought about by their circumstances, mind you - most superheroes are not so much intentionally non-committal but just ignorant or committed to a personal life that they wrench away from only when lives are in danger. This comes down to the same thing, of course, but the writers have had the same problems with the formula that we do now. Earlier comic book superheroes were much more clear in being stalwart champions of the status quo; Superman would literally just sit and wait for the president to call him to action, that sort of thing. After all, why do anything in a world that is already perfect, except for enemy action?<br><br>Looking at the deconstructed post-80s superhero, on the other hand... seems to me that these guys are often pretty active. Of course not in any constructive way, but they do take more of an interest in attacking their enemies first. The enemies are also not just citizens who become crooks when they commit a crime, but actual dictators, terrorists and other evil people who already were evil and attackable long before the story started. A modern superhero story might actually start with the heroes attacking the villain. Quite different from the classical form.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196976/#Comment_196976" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-14T21:59:25+00:00" title="March 14, 2009  9:59PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think maybe some superheroes are there to set the world right.

I don't remember the specifics without dredging up my files, but basically you could get Karma by describe any attribute in action "between the scenes." Use your Fighting to spar with a young neophyte hero, use Agility to save a puppy lost on the freeway, display your Strength at a charity meet-and-greet, and so on. The color result + the amount of details you used would be added to your Karma. Or something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, to be a "proactive" hero, you don't have to be mighty overlords like the Squadron Supreme or Ozymandias.

Investigations, for the heroes that actually did them, were very straightforward affairs that ended when the villain was caught.  As far as what they did when they were sitting around waiting for a villain to strike, well, that never came up.  A villain <i>always</i> struck.  And if one didn't, Jimmy Olsen would dutifully run out and get superpowers and need to be restored to normal, or a natural disaster would occur and only a superhero could save the people endangered by it, or whatever.  The point was, the superhero only really existed in order to set things right, and so things were always needing to be set right.<br/><br/>Silver Age heroes were also very reactive, dealing with whatever villain or crisis popped up on their radar that month.  Investigations could occasionally be more complicated -- weeding out double- and triple-crosses, a little bit of following up on things after the bad guy was caught -- but only rarely.  One of the big differences in this era, I think, was that sometimes the hero didn't have any crisis to deal with other than internal ones, such as romantic entanglements or secret identity problems or self-esteem issues.  Silver Age heroes could be very proactive about preventing, or more often causing, trouble for themselves, even while remaining strictly reactive towards crime.<br/><br/>When all the deconstructionist takes on superheroes started to really take off, the most popular thing to poke at was the idea that your high-octane heroes would start using their powers to proactively reshape the world as they wanted it to be.  Between comics like Moore's <i>Watchmen</i> and Ellis's <i>The Authority</i>, you can see the general outline those stories followed:  with great power comes great megalomania and a lot of morally dubious utilitarian posturing.<br/><br/>Even recent stuff like DC's <i>Identity Crisis</i> and Marvel's <i>Avengers Illuminati</i>/<i>Civil War</i> tends to go that route.  Having enough power to really change the status quo generally means that you will fuck it up and make things worse rather than better if you ever actually use that power.  Real, substantive, world-improving change comes from the vast population of ordinary people doing the right thing of their own free will, not from a few godlike individuals forcing the right thing on everyone.  This is a wonderfully idealistic and very American sentiment, which is why it keeps coming back, I'm sure.  (I'm not familiar with comics from other countries, so perhaps the moral could be different somewhere else?)<br/><br/>And then there's the Punisher, and all the other kill-crazy vigilantes from the '90s.  Very proactive about killing the bad guys without waiting for them to do something bad first, very morally gray.  Usually filed in the "their heart is in the right place, but they frequently go too far" category.<br/><br/>Modern comics still tend toward the reactive crimefighting with proactive personal life, probably for the same reasons that deconstructionist stories paint proactive heroes as villains in the end.  They do tend to be more comfortable with very complicated investigations requiring lots of proactive steps and with messy endings, though.<br/><br/>In some genres (I'm thinking of the "superhero espionage" stories like DC's <i>Checkmate</i> or anything touching on SHIELD over in Marvel), proactive intervention is very much the norm.  But in those cases, obviously it's an organization deciding to be proactive, and the battle lines are clearly drawn.  Nick Fury fought Hydra and AIM and any other clearly identified terrorist organizations with snazzy uniforms; he didn't send SHIELD in to fight sovereign nations or keep the peace in wartorn countries.  Within those boundaries, the good guys are always extremely proactive (as befits the espionage genre).<br/><br/><br/>In general, I have to confess that I like my superheroes to be reactive when it comes to crime.  I admit, I totally buy the party line on where true, substantive, positive change must arise, and reject the idea that Superman or anyone else has the right, let alone the necessary skill and knowledge, to impose a "better" world on us.  And as a child of the '80s Silver Age, I also like my superheroes to be a little messed up when it comes to their personal lives, and to have to deal with that.  And as a modern comics fan, I like complicated mysteries and messy endings.  Your mileage may vary.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Those villains were really just rooming together and actually staying out of trouble and below the radar. When the young supers attacked their house - unprovoked - they pushed one of those villains over the edge and he blew up a significant part of the town - including a school full of children. That brought on the call for superhero registration and the resulting Civil War (which was a completely terrible story, all-in-all). So there's another significant example of any superhero proactiveness being severely punished in the fiction of the genre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197006/#Comment_197006" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T09:04:02+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  9:04AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the world of comic book publishing (as opposed to comic book style gaming), the regular monthly issues of the big-selling titles <i>have</i> to be about reactive heroes:  They are all set in an evolving place that is roughly 'current-day-real-world-plus-superheroes', i.e. the Marvel or DC universes.  If the superheroes could make a real difference and change the world, then the world in the comics would quickly diverge from the world outside the reader's collective front doors.  That's bad for reader-identification with the setting, and bad for sales.  <br/><br/>If the Avengers or the Justice League go out and proactively use their powers to prevent the 9/11 attacks, or end famine in Ethiopia, or somehow enforce a peace deal in the Middle East, then the ramifications of that in the setting make it a very different world from what happened in real history in the real world.  Some portion of the audience will lose track of the changes, or dislike the theorized ramifications as 'unrealistic', and stop buying the book.  Plus, he continuity-checkers at the publishing house will have even more trouble keeping up than they do now...  <br/><br/>There are ways around this for publishers.  They can set their stories in what is already an altered or separate timeline, one that doesn't have to conform to the idea of 'current-day-real-world-plus-superheroes', they can set stories in entirely fictional settings, etc. Their heroes can do world-shaking, world-altering <i>fictional</i> things, too.  Galactus didn't <i>eat</i> the Earth in the late 80s, Doctor Doom <i>didn't</i> become world dictator any of the times he tried, etc. <br/><br/>As gamers, we can utilize that last trick to good effect:  The way for contemporary superheroes to be proactive is for them to be proactive about things that are <i>entirely fictional</i>.  The heroes can proactively stop a supervillain (or a terrorist cell) from blowing up the Statue of Liberty, they can end the famine in a fictional country, or broker peace between two other fictional countries, etc.  The things that they do can certainly be higher-profile news stories than any contemporary real news stories, so long as they don't upset the status quo of the parallel parts of their fictional version of the real world.  Give the PCs news stories and hints of what is going on in their world, and if they become proactive about those things, it's all good.<br/><br/>Of course, feel free to allow the superheroes to proactively save the world from global catastrophes like comet impacts and nuclear Armageddon.  If that sort of thing happens for real, the fact that the history of your game has diverged unrecognizably from the history of the real world will be the least of your problems.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197023/#Comment_197023" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T14:14:11+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  2:14PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2009 4:58PM by Nathan_H.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know in the games that I've played, it's as much about the interplay as it is about the villian's plot.<br/>There's as much player character bickering as there is good guy/bad guy punching.<br/>If ya look at the old Kirby/Lee stuff, specifically the Fantastic Four, sure you had bad guys, but their relationships effected the fights.   <br/>One hand washes the other.<br/>There's typically so many dead ends that get generated in rpgs.<br/>Actions that have varying importance.<br/>It's a bit different than a story that's been combed over.<br/>But yeah, Jared firehouse analogy is pretty good.  <br/>If I were doing a fire station rpg, you'd get resources for praise &amp; blame that you'd use to fight the fire and rescue people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197034/#Comment_197034" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T15:38:55+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  3:38PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jared A.

And in the latter half of the series, they definitely veer into proactive territory.  Not really world-changing, though, in the sense of trying to make the world a better place by ending wars or helping people.  More about grappling with the secret history of the world.<br/><br/>The Authority actually did go proactive in terms of imposing change on the world, but the storylines--at least those of the first arc--were reactive, as the team fought off a series of over-the-top threats, usually after some massive, near-shark-jumping onslaught that required them to go out and beat up a million people.

Your heroes, if they wanted to present a good face to the city, could be doing something like rebuilding houses or perhaps in a friendly competition with another hero team nearby. More or less though, if you're fighting villains it's going to be normally reactive. I did have a character in a super hero campaign with shapeshifting and martial arts that went on patrols (or as he put it "Pit-Trolling") looking like an easy target for criminals. If one took the bait, he'd beat the crap out of them, take their stuff (which he referred to as fines- mostly cash money and trophies) and then call the police for pick up. It was his major source of income and something to do when super villains weren't rampaging across the city.<br/><br/>Somehow, this wasn't viewed as a good thing by the other members of the team he was on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197177/#Comment_197177" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T09:27:26+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  9:27AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...was his code name "Entrapment"?  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/><br/>I always had a warm place in my heart for non-combat superpowers.  Back when mutants were all the rage over at Marvel, I'd keep an eye on the ones whose powers were useful in ordinary life (instant comprehension of all languages, anyone?) even though, well, nothing interesting ever seemed to be done with those characters.  Because the books they appeared in were about the fighting, naturally -- you have to work really hard to fit a noncombat character into that kind of story, and even when you do it's obvious you're just shoehorning him in.<br/><br/>Sometimes, though, they'd try out a different sort of book.  <i>District X</i>, for example, featured lots of mutants who were just ordinary citizens trying to get by in the mutant ghetto of NYC.

You said what I was trying to say above-- that being a proactive superhero doesn't mean becoming The Authority. A proactive superhero uses his superspeed to distribute food to the needy, his x-ray vision to inspect old buildings, his power ring to filter polluted lakes, his shape-changing to entertain children's cancer wards, etc. etc. In other words, pretty boring comics books, however well-intentioned. Perhaps there'd be a way to use them as springboards into other adventures, but by in large such stuff doesn't have the mythic scope and epic conflict that superhero stories are really all about.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, at the risk of making a tangent, I don't think this would work either, based on a discussion my friends and I had regarding what it would take to create a truly Global Golden Age, without any science fiction-ish elements to it (meaning no Star Trek replicators or anything.) We were growing quite frustrated by the fact that it all seemed to come down to a one-world government, but that in and of itself was something we agreed is just about as science-fictiony as anything. There always will seem to be some faction that would rather favor autonomy even if it means unequal distribution of food/water, shelter, medicine, education, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197419/#Comment_197419" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T11:26:29+00:00" title="March 17, 2009 11:26AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, can you imagine a young Superhero trying to get into college...<br/>\n<br/>\n"It says here that you're strongly involved in community service, but it doesn't give any specifics..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197426/#Comment_197426" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T11:54:41+00:00" title="March 17, 2009 11:54AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do they do if there's nothing to react to?<br><br>If I was running a Supers game (which would never happen) my Heroes would doctor crime for themselves to solve to prove their worth.<br><br>They'd be the LAPD on crack.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197524/#Comment_197524" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T22:05:52+00:00" title="March 17, 2009 10:05PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>What do they do if there's nothing to react to?</blockquote>\nThey bluebook.  I assume there are months where Spiderman, Batman, etc don't do jack but patrol - they just don't make it to the comic page.  When it is showtime, they need a conflict to make us care.  One of the best Batman comics was him doing a bunch of small-time crime fighting that kept interrupting his desire to get a good's night sleep.  When he finally got done, he went to sleep and it was a satisfying story arc.<br/><br/>When you are at the table, there should be a conflict or a choicepoint, but it doesn't always have to be a crime.  It is possible the conflict is to make them chose which Candidate to endorse in an upcoming Mayoral election.  Give them two decent choices with some idealistic differences (or make it a "lesser of two evils" choice) and watch the character development and drama happen as they hash it out.<br/><br/>On the political front, have them deal with protesters, groups who do not think what they do is good for society, obsessed fans and copy-cats, etc.  It is all good story fodder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197532/#Comment_197532" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T02:51:57+00:00" title="March 18, 2009  2:51AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One solution is to have a precognitive character or predictive computer which enables the characters to be proactive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197594/#Comment_197594" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T11:25:32+00:00" title="March 18, 2009 11:25AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Minority Report, anyone?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197621/#Comment_197621" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T12:31:18+00:00" title="March 18, 2009 12:31PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of my good points have already been taken (The Authority, Civil War, etc.).<br/><br/>There have been some comics that directly take this on. If you get a chance, read Grant Morrison's first arc on JLA (I'd loan it to you, but I think my copy is in NM). It revolves around what happens when the reactive JLA are upstaged by an alien superteam who are proactive. (In general I'd recommend all of Morrison's JLA, some of my favorite supers comics of all time). Waid's Kingdom Come is also a great case of taking traditional heroes and making them proactive.<br/><br/>To drill down a bit, it seems like most traditional heroes don't have a particular agenda to further, for the most part. Superman and Batman, for example, want to make the world a better place, which isn't a very actionable goal until something goes wrong. Superman in particular is sometimes cast as a force for the status quo. Wonder Woman on the other hand at least has a bit of an agenda (presenting her culture in man's world). The X-Men (depending on the writer) can be pretty proactive. Morrison's X-Men go out into the world and promote mutant equality, Whedon's X-Men wait around for big flashy missions.<br/><br/>Taking this into speculation, since it sounds like this would be a game, maybe have each character or the team as a whole have an agenda, something along the lines of BW/Mouse Guard beliefs? Go with the same guidelines and you quickly narrow down the kind of story you want: since it has to be something that leads to action, you throw out the JLA and the Avengers and push the story towards X-Men and The Authority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197623/#Comment_197623" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T12:33:43+00:00" title="March 18, 2009 12:33PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Addendum: Of course I forgot my whole reason for bringing up Morrison's JLA.

Batman doesn't have to wait until something "goes wrong." His is a very proactive program. He's actively seeking out the disease and eliminating it. You're right in that he's not trying to fill the vacuum he's making.. He's trying to allow the system to reassert itself into the areas that have been overcome by crime and villainy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuperman is working in a relatively stable environment. Day to day, the situation is acceptable. Sure, there are minor crimes that he'll stop if he can, but nothing that actually requires him rather than just letting the cops do their job. His situation is tenable until something changes, at which point, he works to reestablish the status quo. Batman's situation is untenable. He works to upset the status quo, and allow the theoretically pre-existing system to come in and stabilize things in his wake.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir goals, in relation to "the establishment" are the same.

Batman is pro-active in his own milieu, because Gotham City is so horrible. The status quo in Gotham City is that the mobsters run the town, the crazies mangle the helpless and the cops do nothing about it, and if Batman doesn't do something, the status quo will remain.<br/><br/>Well, we don't see that reflected much in the comics after Year One type stuff. Post Year One, it's a weekly breakout from Arkham. I really can't think of any notable Batman stories that start with Batman doing something, every Caped Crusader tale I can think of starts off with somebody bad doing something bad. So in concept, yeah, Batman wan'ts to clean up the city. In execution, that means waiting for Calender Man to break out of his nice padded cell.<br/><br/>And, just to comic book nerd out for a moment: currently in Batman, Gotham's been more or less cleaned up. The entire leadup to R.I.P. starts with Batman basically not having a lot to do and relearning how to be Bruce Wayne.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197893/#Comment_197893" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T16:11:37+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  4:11PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2009 4:12PM by Nathan_H.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know.<br/>I love that superheroes are kinda incapable of livng healthy productive lives.<br/>I mean they fight bad guys, I don't need 'em to build highways, fuck I can do that. <br/>I don't picture Sherlock Holmes as being a great housekeeper.<br/>Superheroes are fuck-ups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197909/#Comment_197909" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T16:58:15+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  4:58PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I take it back, well some of it back.<br/>One of the best sessions I've played in was when our team(the Renegades)played the Avengers in softball.<br/>It was a close one, but we won!<br/>So yeah, I could see how a softball team or a bowling league would be fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197937/#Comment_197937" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T19:09:26+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  7:09PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H</cite>I mean they fight bad guys, I don't need 'em to build highways, fuck I can do that.</blockquote>\nThat's actually a good point.  Yes, Superman can go out and build infrastructure and deliver the mail and carry medical supplies to Africa, but so can a team of ordinary people with no superpowers at all.  Yeah, Superman can do it all by himself, but it's not like the job can't get done without him.  On the other hand, when the giant death-robot comes stomping into the city, only Superman can punch it into outer space: you could get every citizen within the city limits together, and they won't be able to do <i>shit</i> to a giant death-robot.  It looks like a job for Superman...no others need apply.<br/><br/>So given that, is it even remotely responsible for superpowered dudes to focus their attention on doing things that normal people can take care of?  Shouldn't superheroes try to guarantee an immediate response to the emergencies that only they are capable of dealing with, instead of doing stuff that ordinary people can handle just fine on their own?  <br/><br/>And if Superman decides he wants to work construction whenever there are no giant death-robots to punch (he's got a giant death-robot detector, so we all know he'll be there when one shows up), how many ordinary construction workers just lost their jobs?  Yeah, whoopee, we just got that bridge built ridiculously fast and with only one worker on the payroll, that's wonderful...but how badly fucked does the economy get when one guy can do the work of hundreds, only faster and better?<br/><br/>So show some responsibility with your great power, superheroes!  You want to help and you don't think fighting crime is enough?  Then go fucking donate to charity, or cure cancer, or whatever else soothes your conscience: as long as you can do it without stealing jobs from ordinary people who need to pay their mortgages, we won't have any problems and we won't need to bust out the Kryptonite on you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197940/#Comment_197940" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T19:30:54+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  7:30PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unbeknownst to us all, several superhero leagues have been avidly lurking in this thread.

Spider-man fixes flat tires, Captain America helps old ladies across the street, Iron Man uses his GPS to direct lost tourists, etc. Luke Cage explains that the basic idea is to reduce crime and to make neighborhoods that need help highly visible - an embarrassment to their cities that need to be cleaned up. My favorite line is when he points to a building scheduled for demolition that turned into a crackhouse, right next to a school, and says that if nothing happens, the next time he's in town he's going to tear the crackhouse down with his bare hands.<br/><br/>For this, I love Luke Cage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8919/superheroes-do-they-just-wait-around-for-trouble" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8919/superheroes-do-they-just-wait-around-for-trouble" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8919/superheroes-do-they-just-wait-around-for-trouble/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8919%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8919%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
