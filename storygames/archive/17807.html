Written by Jake Norwood it emphasized player-driven story through the character's Spiritual Attributes and had a fabulous melee combat system that did away with the traditional "I Go/ You Go" round the table approach and moved towards a cinematic-scene style.<br/><br/>TRoS came out about 11 years ago now and I just want to let you know that a successor game is now available. Called <b>Blade of the Iron Throne</b> it is available from the Iron Throne Publishing website at www.ironthronepublishing.com. The PDF -- all 15 mb of it -- is free but you do have to register on the site to see the Downloads menu option. The game was released on Saturday morning and we've just had our 400th download of the game.<br/><br/>Blade is a spiritual successor to TRoS. What does that mean? It means that the rights to the game have long since disappeared so we couldn't produce TRoS 2.0. 8 ^ )<br/><br/>What it also means is that the game has a number of the same design goals as TRoS -- player-driven story and exciting edge-of-the-seat combat scenes. Blade though has been designed from the ground up to support the Swords and Sorcery literary genre. The very mechanics of the game support S&amp;S tropes.<br/><br/>Anyway, everyone is welcome to download the game and we would love to hear your feedback.<br/><br/>Many thanks,<br/><br/>Ian P.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402853/#Comment_402853" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-06T18:42:38+00:00" title="January  6, 2013  6:42PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ian,<br/><br/>What needed changing in TROS to make this game?

I was confused at first.<br/><br/>Ian,<br/><br/>I have a few questions:<br/><br/>What, in particular, makes this game particularly well suited to Sword and Sorcery? I see a lot of references to Conan in the text, but I'm not sure what makes this game more suited to S&amp;S than any other reasonably generic fantasy game. In particular, I'm looking at the fact that the game assumes a party of several relative novices, and a slow progression of those characters, as they pursue an overarching goal through multiple adventures. Which Sword and Sorcery stories in particular fit that framework? The bibliography is really good, and shows a very deep reading of Sword and Sorcery literature (much deeper than mine!) so I am a bit confused!<br/><br/>How do you feel the extremely detailed and strategic combat system serves the Sword and Sorcery genre?<br/><br/>Swords and Sorcery has a pretty strong history of racism and sexism. How does this game address that history? I haven't read the game closely enough to really get a good sense of that.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Simon<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402872/#Comment_402872" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-06T22:39:31+00:00" title="January  6, 2013 10:39PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Over on the trosfans forum, in the subforum dedicated to the design of a successor game, more than ninety threads were opened and more than two thousand posts made discussing issues people had with the TRoS mechanics and suggestions for resolving those issues.

How does this game address that history? I haven't read the game closely enough to really get a good sense of that.</blockquote>\nI'm not the game's author/designer but I'll have a crack anyway.<br/><br/><br/>1) Over on Howard Andrew Jones (have you read his S&amp;S books?) forum he describes some of the tropes of S&amp;S thus:<br/><br/>a) The Environment:<br/>Sword-and-sorcery fiction takes place in lands different from our own, where technology is relatively primitive, allowing the protagonists to overcome their martial obstacles face-to-face. Magic works, but seldom at the behest of the heroes. More often sorcery is just one more obstacle used against them and is usually wielded by villains or monsters. The landscape is exotic; either a different world, or far corners of our own. Sword-and-sorcery distances itself further from high or epic fantasy by adopting a gritty, realistic tone that creates an intense, often grim, sense of realism seemingly at odds with a fantasy setting.<br/><br/>b) The Protagonists:<br/>The heroes live by their cunning or brawn, frequently both. They are usually strangers or outcasts, rebels imposing their own justice on the wilds or the strange and decadent civilizations which they encounter. They are usually commoners or barbarians; should they hail from the higher ranks of society then they are discredited, disinherited, or come from the lower ranks of nobility (the lowest of the high). The protagonists in sword-and-sorcery fiction are most often thieves, mercenaries, or barbarians struggling not for worlds or kingdoms, but for their own gain or mere survival.<br/><br/>c) Obstacles:<br/>Sword-and-sorcery\u2019s protagonists must best fantastic dangers, monstrous horrors, and dark sorcery to earn riches, astonishing treasure, the love of dazzling members of the opposite sex, or the right to live another day.<br/><br/>d) Structure:<br/>Sword-and-sorcery is usually crafted with traditional structure. Stream-of-consciousness, slice-of-life, or any sort of experimental narrative effects, when they appear, are methods used to advance the plot, rather than ends in themselves. A tale of sword-and-sorcery has a beginning, middle, and end; a problem and solution; a climax and resolution. Most important of all, sword-and-sorcery moves at a headlong pace and overflows with action and thrilling adventure.<br/><br/>e) Pacing:<br/>While exotic landscape is present, even common, in sword-and-sorcery, it is displayed differently and toward a different effect.  Sword-and-sorcery was birthed in an entirely different tradition. Robert E. Howard, its creator, wrote for the pulps. The pulp magazines, the television of their day, were fueled by quick moving action. The stories needed to grab you within the first few sentences so that if you were browsing the magazine at the news stand you\u2019d feel compelled to purchase it to finish. The pulp stories were meant to seize your attention from the opening lines and never let go.<br/><br/>We could spend hourse dissecting the genre but for the sake of answering your question I'll just look at these.<br/><br/>a) The world of Xoth, which Blade uses as its setting, is straight from Conan. It is grim and gritty, and you won't find a Hobbit or an Elf anywhere within.<br/><br/>b) The character generation system ensures two things straight out of Char Gen. Firstly, the player's character is extraordinary, capable of besting a horde of lesser men. So there is no concept of a "first level" character being an apprentice and slowly moving their way through an array of levels towards a character that can eventually take care of itself. The protagonist of any S&amp;S tale can be created through the character generation system. Secondly, while extremely capable all player characters are deeply flawed. They cannot help but have their own achilles heel, and these flaws are as integral to the story that will be told through that character as their extraordinary capabilities.<br/><br/>c) In Blade, when a player "botches" a roll, the referee has the option of that attempted activity failing in some spectacular way or the referee can convert that botched roll into a Complication. A Complication is an adverse plot element that directly affects that character and relates to one or more of their Passion Attributes (the player's definition of what they want the game to be about for their character). So rather than simply fumbling some ordinary skill roll, the referee has carte blanche to really up the pressure on the player by introducing a major plot twist. This is the mechanic that supports the S&amp;S obstacle concept.<br/><br/>d) and e) Blade has been designed from the ground up to ensure that scenes resolve at a breakneck speed. The dice are only rolled when it is important to do so. Equipment is abstracted -- you only check whether your character has something when your character needs it. Skills largely default when tasks are straightforward. For example, if the character was a sailor in their youth then it is assumed that they know their way around a boat and can handle the routine tasks of boat maintenance. They do not need to have a Sailor skill unless that is a focus of the character.<br/><br/>Combat scenes are designed to resolve inside twenty minutes. There are no miniatures, no hex mats giving a visual representation of the tactical environment, as these things slow down the combat scene. In combat, each character holds the Limelight until something interesting happens (a cliffhanger, if you will). So, from a pacing perspective, the pressure is always on the player until the scene resolves -- there are no one roll turns where very little happens. Combat manoeuvres are detailed, allowing everyone at the gaming table to see the action as it unfolds but the resolution of these manoeuvres is quick in real time.<br/><br/>Finally, in Blade, the game supports player-driven story rather than referee-driven story. In traditional RPGs which support referee-driven story, it is the referee's job to create the gaming environment and to create the scenari material. In creating the scenario material they come up with a plot that is driven by NPCs which the players try to discern and react to. In player-driven story, it is the payers who define what the game will be about. They do this by defining the Passion Attributes for their character. PAs are simple statements such as "Death Before Disloyalty" or "Protect the Queen's cousin from the advances of Baron Duquesne". The referee is required to build scenes that hit the character's Passion Attributes -- but not define the scene's possible exits. That is entirely up to the players. Much of the game revolves around this concept, and it ensures that the game unfolds in a surprising way to all and at a breakneck pace.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Ian P.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IanPlumb" title="IanPlumb"><img alt="IanPlumb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/793/nJ38N6CBC1GXD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IanPlumb">IanPlumb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402876/#Comment_402876" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-07T00:11:33+00:00" title="January  7, 2013 12:11AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>FWIW, Hans, we'll be playing "TROS edited down w/ Ben's fixes."

A lot of people over the past five years have heard about TRoS -- but by then the only way to get a hardcopy of the game was through Ebay (at massively inflated prices).

In the top left corner there is a demoness (long tail, glowing eyes) in the midst of bewitching some poor hapless oaf. In the bottom right is a tribute to the classic Frank Frazetta image of S&amp;S. The demonesses wild hair covers one breast but the other is exposed.

I mean, where would one establish core values of a game if not in the art and presentation? Precepts of good design aside, of course. I suppose you could just not have art and rely on words solely - I'd be a fan, but it's certainly a less-traveled road in rpg publishing.<br/><br/>Seems like a pretty interesting project, although I'm curious as to how relevant TRoS-style European swordplay is to the genre of S&amp;S fantasy.

At least the part of the community I'm a part of. The female characters in the book's art are almost all topless, in chainmail bikinis, or in sexual poses. There are no non-white heroes in the art of the book at all. There are maybe three or four pictures that depict non-white people, and they are blatantly monstrous or mentioned as part of the setting's flavor. I'm not offended by boobies (I love me some boobies in fact), but I can totally see how the art in the game could offend a lot of people, many of which would be highly interested otherwise. Blame the inspiration or whatever helps the author not feel accountable, but I think it's pretty obvious it's just a matter of not really caring (hence the "then don't play it?" response). <br/><br/>In terms of the actual content, I think I'm just getting too old to read three hundred pages of rules for a game. I guess I don't see the need for that level of detail anymore. While there might actually be some cool rules or whatever, I'd have to dig through hundreds of pages of (what I find to be) unnecessary text to find them. <br/><br/>Good qualities? I like the layout pretty well. Some of the art, despite its narrow social focus, is pretty high quality.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IanPlumb" title="IanPlumb"><img alt="IanPlumb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/793/nJ38N6CBC1GXD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IanPlumb">IanPlumb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403075/#Comment_403075" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-08T16:30:29+00:00" title="January  8, 2013  4:30PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>For me, it's awkward at work.

Riddle of Steel was a mythical beast of an RPG for me, one that I've owned for years and never had the opportunity to play, and it's great to know that there are people still shepherding the game along. I've read through large portions of the text and I do like a lot of what I see here. I really appreciate the new take on the combat system, and the growth toward a sword and sorcery game feels organic and well-considered. <br/><br/>I have a couple of criticisms I do want to talk about. I hope I don't come off as "piling on". I really think there's some gold here in BotIT, but there are some things getting in the way. Hopefully you'll view these criticisms positively and take them under consideration. <br/><br/>I think there are some valid statements and questions in this thread though, and stuff you should really consider. There is some exception to the presentation and art design in the current book and, while you may have no objection to it, it's worth keeping in mind that others do and that you may be losing downloads and players because of that. As a producer of product intended for public consumption, it's a good idea to keep in mind the sensibilities of those that you reach. <br/><br/>I'm very happy to hear that the later edition will have different art direction. I do think the border art is a complete misstep. Yes, the one-sided gender presentation is a big-time turn off (two naked ladies, but not even one shirtless man? Every male in the border looks ready to wade into battle, but the females are to a one all submissive and sexualized. And not a single non-white person in the border?) Equally as bad, that border is way too big and bulky! It washes over the page like crazy and dwarfs the text and muddies the art. <br/><br/>I just showed the PDF to my girlfriend. She was completely on board from the cover through the chapter pages (though she did remark that the type is a bit small), but as soon as that border showed up on-screen she immediately frowned and remarked how distracting and ugly it was. <br/><br/>If you really want to have a big, flashy page border, look at the way Fantasy Flight Games does their Warhammer books, both Fantasy and 40k. Those books are produced within an inch of their lives, but those borders all work. Not only do they feel like they add to the visual language of the books, they are great research tools! I can do a quick flip through my copy of Rogue Trader and know exactly what chapter I'm in just by the chapter call-outs on the sides of the pages.<br/><br/>I know that this is a stopgap edition of the text, and that there's every intent to create a finalized text a little later on down the line. I really hope you guys take a second look at the text itself, really get down into its guts. A lot of the it felt very stiff to me, like it groans under the weight of INSTRUCTION. More than that though, I don't feel like it's the best text for a person new to this game. A lot of the concepts early on in the text aren't well explained, almost like they presume an already existing knowledge of TRoS.<br/><br/>On the subject of text, the italics call-outs in the body of the text don't really work that well for me. I'd say either employ a text box to highlight that information, or drop the italic text and re-examine the presentation to make those important ideas stand out more. Use a different typeface. <br/><br/>That character sheet could use another look, too. There are two cardinal sins when it comes to character sheets that I see getting committed here. <br/><br/>First, you don't have a b&amp;w version of the sheet. Color is expensive to print, and the first request that I see from a lot of gamers is a b&amp;w sheet. This doesn't just mean a sheet that gets color shifted, but one that is considered from the bottom up to be printed in black and white. Drop out your greytones, eliminate the background, that sort of stuff. <br/><br/>Second, the sigils for the attributes make it hard to record important character information. They're hard to write against, especially with the names of the attributes written in the centers of them. The different colors and designs are also... well, they're kinda ugly to me. They clash pretty hard and don't really add anything. And the sigil for Sagacity is probably the worst offender. I'd say either drop the sigils entirely, or use one design for all of them and move the attribute titles out of the sigils. <br/><br/>That's about it from my mouthy self for now. Thanks for your work in keeping the Riddle going. I only hope that you don't take these criticisms personally, and instead use this outsider's perspective to make your game even stronger than it already is. <br/><br/>Heck, I've got a pick-up game this Sunday. I think I'm going to add BotIT to my short-list of games to run!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403234/#Comment_403234" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-09T15:39:16+00:00" title="January  9, 2013  3:39PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">@Zachary_Wolf</a><br/><br/>Twitter is useful for me because it's pre-selected.

I gained that impression from seeing the use it was being put to socially.<br/><br/>But then I looked at how small businesses were using it. So I gave it a go for Blade.

That saw the message reach hundreds of people.

It's a measure of how invested you are in the economy of "patronage in exchange for dreams" that sites like Kickstarter (or Indiegogo) provide. It doesn't mean that you're "good" or "bad", just "are you a member of a community? Or are you using that community?"<br/><br/>Maybe it's an echo of what I've seen happen in other communities, heck even like this one!<br/>* Someone shows up, their first post is "Hi! Please give me feedback on this game I wrote!", then they disappear right after. They're not evil or whatever, just flaky and one-sided. You don't need to be a Member In Good Standing to get feedback, but heck maybe reading or commenting on 1-2 other threads builds at least a nascent foundation of goodwill.<br/><br/>For me, the community that develops in Kickstarter is important. It's humbling. As a project creator, I try to do right by my backers, take what they've given me in support and give even more back. I don't see them as wallets with legs that give me rent money, who I'm free to ignore, block, lie to, etc. Being a backer of another project (or a few) brings you into that circle, helps you see that cycle and be influenced by it.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Kickstarter is such a small slice of the universe that it seems that people are quite capable of being saints or parasites completely outside its measurement systems.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>Oh, absolutely! Don't get me wrong, there are KS project creators who <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elizabethsampat/they-became-flesh-a-game-of-god-humanity-and-the-f/comments" rel="nofollow">lie to, ignore, block, bully, fleece, and disregard their backers, even coming to the self-rationalization that they are *victims* of their backers</a>. "Having backed projects" is not a measurement of if you're a good person or a shitty human being. <br/><br/>But if one is capable of any empathy, being in the cycle of project fulfillment as a backer helps you understand the process, so that you're more willing to understand the whole process, understand what it feels like to be a backer (so you can avoid potholes) and helps you say "I understand and support this community; I'm not here because I thought, 'Hey, Money.'

I have seen some signs of that sort of thing from active Kickstarter-ists now and then, but I'm not really into it enough to know whether it's actually a community or just a platform. I mean, in logical terms there's no reason why it'd be a community - it's just a way to organize patronage, it doesn't have a forum or political direction or anything community-like. You'd know better, of course.

I don't know whether the colour border from the free PDF will go completely, but I do know that versions of the game will be made available that have different border art as well as no border art.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Ian P.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409824/#Comment_409824" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T19:15:41+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  7:15PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From what I understand <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/adept/index.php?topic=89.msg811#msg811" rel="nofollow">Ron Edward</a>s hadn't backed anything before starting a project.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409829/#Comment_409829" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T19:56:37+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  7:56PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd call that an exception because he has is own fans and more name recognition than Ian.

There are three main concepts that differentiate Blade from other RPGs, in particular mainstream RPGs.<br/><br/>Melee Combat:<br/><br/>Melee combat is manoeuvre-driven and produces a specific result. What does that mean? It means that the attacker selects an Offensive Manoeuvre (based on their combat style or Proficiency), the defender selects a Defensive Manoeuvre (based on their potentially quite different combat style or Proficiency), both allocate dice from their dice pool, they roll, and a result is obtained. Generally speaking these results will be one of:<br/><br/>- Defense successful and gains the initiative, or<br/>- Attack successful but no wound (retains initiative), or<br/>- Attack successful and a wound occurrs (severity of wound determined by the margin of success on the dice roll plus other factors)<br/><br/>All wounds are specific -- based on location on the body, type of weapons, and margin of success. They produce mechanical effects such as Shock (an immediate effect on the defender's dice pool), Pain (an ongoing effect on the defender's dice pool), and potentially Blood Loss (which kills quickly if untreated). Wounds also have a specific result at higher levels, such as broken limbs, permanent impairment, amputation, and death. All of this can be summarized by the design goals -- no generic damage (as in a Hit Points type of mechanic), cummulative reduction of fighting capacity across multiple wounds, colourful specific damage, and death only results from a specific wound or Blood Loss.<br/><br/>The other major point in Blade's combat system is that it isn't an "I Go/You Go" progression around the gaming table. An IGYG system has one payer performing one action and then the next player performs an action and so on around the table. Blade combat is designed to produce like combat scenes from nooks and films. By this I mean that the camera (or Limelight as we term it) stays with a player character until something interesting happens and then it moves to the next player character. Non-player characters do not have a Limelight -- they only become important when they interact with a player character, and therefore belong to the player's Limelight. The effect of this on the combat scene is that each player is always on the edge of their seat when their Limelight ends as it always ends on a mini-cliffhanger. There are no Limelights where "nothing happens" as is often the case with IGYG where an individual turn might be one roll of the dice which simply resolves to a failed attempt at attacking. Best of all it ensures that non-melee characters can integrate smoothly with the combat environment -- as they receive a Limelight as often as the melee characters. Their Limelight might resolve more swiftly, but they do get the opportunity to do something meaningful.<br/><br/>Player-Driven Story:<br/><br/>In Blade, the players are responsible for the story - not the referee. What does that mean? It means that Blade has mechanics which ensure that the players tell the referee what they want the scenario to be about, it has mechanics which ensure that the player's character performs better when following the material the referee prepared in response to the player's plot requests, and mechanics which ensure that the player receives character development resource when engaging with scenes relevant to their character. That's a mouthful, so let me break it down.<br/><br/>Each character has four Passion Attributes (PAs), each with a maximum value of 5. Each PA describes something that is important to the character but, specifically, is central to the story that the player wants to tell through their character. PAs are created communally and in the open, the idea being that as a player comes up with a PA another player is inspired to come up with something that supports that player's PA or might be drawn into conflict with that player's PA. Across the playing group there will be some PAs that draw the characters closer together and some PAs that might, potentially at least, bring them into narrative conflict (not combat, but conflict from the perspective of narrative).<br/><br/>The referee, also involved in the PA round-table, comes up with the context for specific scenes wherein the players PAs will be engaged. When a player's PA is engaged in a scene the score of that PA adds to their dice pool. Thus their character is more effective. More than one PA may be engaged by a scene - potentially creating quite an effect on the dice pool. When a player's PA is engaged by a scene and they choose to participate in the scene then they are awarded a point in that PA. If they refuse to engage with the scene then they lose a point from that PA. Thus the player is rewarded for engaging with the material that the referee has gone to so much effort to prepare. Points are awarded regardless of the "success" of the scene for the player.<br/><br/>Finally, all character development is driven by expending PA points. Unless the player acquires PA points their character cannot develop and therefore they will not become more effective in scenes.<br/><br/>Swords &amp; Sorcery<br/><br/>Blade is designed to produce play that mirrors S&amp;S literature. You can see more on this in our forum but one key point that differentiates Blade from mainstream RPGs is that the Char Gen process produces characters that are head and shoulders above non-player characters and characters that are also deeply flawed in some way. The story that will be told through that character is as much about their weakness as it is about their obvious strengths. As a result the flaw isn't something to be mitigated and bought off as quickly as possible -- rather, it is something to be detailed by the player as a necessary aspect of their characterm something that sets their character apart.<br/><br/>In addition, there are no other races than humans in Blade. This is deliberate. In S&amp;S, mankind is responsible for it rises and its falls -- and the falls are built in to the rises, an inevitable, cyclical progression. This process is often mirrored in the protagonists themselves. In S&amp;S, there is no external value system. The individual is responsible for determining their own good, their own evil, as there is no objective value system. The gods, if they exist in an individual setting, do not seek to impose or even encourage a particular behaviour on adherents.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Ian P.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410895/#Comment_410895" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-30T21:56:22+00:00" title="March 30, 2013  9:56PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why 4 PA's, and not the original 5?

In other words, the player can insist that their character's next Limelight be resolved immediately.<br/>Auto Melee Survival (Optional) - Reduces the severity of a killing or maiming blow to incapacitation. In addition, the character cannot be dispatched after the combat.<br/><br/>I think this is changed significantly from The Companion, but I may be wrong.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Ian P.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410944/#Comment_410944" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-31T18:51:31+00:00" title="March 31, 2013  6:51PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's similar, but there were a few other uses from the Companion.

Drama in Blade is much more significant than Drama in TRoS/Companion. In Blade Drama awards are rare -- and, commensurately, expending Drama exerts a powerful influence over the direction of the story. So where TRoS/Companion allows you to modify one die from a fail to a success, or reduce a TN by 1 -- in Blade, you don't have to roll you are successful with MoS determined via pool size. Nevertheless, the idea of Drama in both systems is to provide a metagame mechanic allowing the player to influence outcome where they believe it is significant.

I've never played TRoS, but I used to own a copy and now regret ever parting with it. The idea of a successor/revision to the game is very appealing to me. The idea that this is a labor of love from a group of dedicated fans is doubly so!<br/><br/>But... when I got a look at the PDF preview, I was really disappointed. The border is not only overpowering, but the content of the border was disappointing. Seriously, get rid of it, show more diversity in the art, and make the book look more like <i>Burning Wheel</i> or some of the other games mentioned above, and I will back the project in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>And to anyone who says that overt sexism or racism is unavoidable in S&amp;S, I say take a look at Ron Edwards' <i>Sorcerer and Sword</i>. Sexism and racism are <b>not</b> core to the genre. They have become trappings tacked on by imitators and B-movies; they are not what makes the genre *tick*.
