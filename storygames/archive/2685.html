Good or bad, it will certainly belong on the official <i><a href="http://www.memento-mori.com/octane/" rel="nofollow">octaNe</a></i> inspiration list.  I'm thinking of dusting up the rules and having another episode at our gaming club.  I ran a couple last summer and we had a good time, but I think I might want to graft something like the franchise system from <i>InSpectres</i> this time.

I saw <i>Grindhouse</i> this afternoon.  After all, nothing says "Easter" better than a Rodriguez-Tarantino double-feature.  I had a great time!  It is most definitely <i>octaNe</i> material.  Of the two movies, Rodriguez' offering (<i>Planet Terror</i>) was definitely the better.  For one thing, it was more truly grindhouse material.  Tarantino's <i>Death Proof</i> was fun and had great moments, but could easily have been trimmed of at least 20 minutes of material that added nothing to the movie.  Still, both were octaNe fuel!  <br/><br/>And if anyone is wondering about the potential for sexism: although I went in there bracing myself for the worst, I was pleasantly surprised.  Sure, all the women were definitely buxom babes, but they were all player characters, know what I mean?  In fact, what sexual violence there was, was mostly directed towards men.

I'm not saying it's not grindhouse, I'm saying it's grindhouse that doesn't make women solely objects in the grinding.  Overall, they don't come out worse than men, sexually or otherwise.  But is it about crazy absurd violence?  You bet.  If you didn't like the <i>Mariachi</i> trilogy, you won't like this either.\n<blockquote>There's rape jokes; domestic violence; gory abuse, dismemberment, and murder of women... all kinds of stuff you'll hate.</blockquote>\nAnd much murder of men, yes.  I recall one very unpleasant rape-related joke in the spoof trailer <i>Thanksgiving</i>, but I recall many more castration jokes.  I didn't say it was a tasteful movie -- it's called what, "Grindhouse"?\n<blockquote>Plus Rob Zombie is involved, and he's a talentless, misogynist asshole who couldn't form an original thought to save his life.<br/>He can't even rip-off ideas competently!</blockquote>\nHe directs one 60-second spoof trailer, that was pretty funny too.\n<blockquote>Q: Does making the chick a (sexually objectified) ass-kicking killing machine at the end/ really counterbalance the voyeristic spectacle of graphically depicting her undergoing heaps of torture and suffering?<br/><br/>A: I don't really give a shit.</blockquote>\nFair enough.  If you don't care to see it, don't see it.  Though, the heaps of torture and suffering?  I dunno.  I didn't get the impression, unlike in the original 70s movies this double-feature spoofed/referred to, that this was about cruelty to women.  The bad shit was dealt all around, and if anything female characters did better overall.  \n<blockquote>But those who are primarily concerned with such things should skip this movie.<br/><br/>SPOILER/EDIT:  </blockquote>\nYeah, definitely a spoiler.  You might want to flag them longer in advance.  Also, it was clearly a parody, but whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63274/#Comment_63274" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-09T08:22:19+00:00" title="April  9, 2007  8:22AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2007 12:16PM by Call Me Curly.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't see this movie if you use the word 'gratuitous' as a condemnation.<br/><br/>If would rather avoid the trailer for a shot-for-shot remake of 'Halloween' as directed by Rob Zombie; <br/><br/>Don't.

I'm sad to see so little love for the second feature.  For those that didn't appreciate Deathproof, I'd say it helps if you've seen some of the films that Tarantino is paying homage: Roger Corman films like Faster Pussycat, Kill Kill and 70s car films like Steven Spielberg's Duel.  (Or maybe it was just an uneven mess of pointless dialog and meaningless violence. *shrug*)<br/><br/>I have no exposure to OctaNe, but I thought I'd chime in on Grindhouse and gaming in general.  I noticed a recurring device in both features (especially Planet Terror).  The writers would introduce a "set-up" (i.e. add something to the fictional space of the movie that will be important later) and IMMEDIATELY go for the payoff, usually within the same scene and a scene closely following.<br/><br/>To help capture the feel of the movie, you could give players points they can spend to introduce a new story element into a scene (to either help themselves or hinder another character), but it must immediately pay off.  (Is that similar to how plot points work in OctaNe?)  Heck, you could possibly design an entire system around that mechanic.<br/><br/>Another story-telling device I noticed was escalation:  as the situation gets worse, the characters kick more and more ass.  (A good example is the character Wray in Planet Terror.)  Not sure how you would rule-ify that off the top of my head, but I think you could draw some interesting mechanics from that device.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63613/#Comment_63613" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T06:54:55+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  6:54AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And, of course, the "missing reel" device.
