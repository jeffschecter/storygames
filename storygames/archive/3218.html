It's been a long time since that kind of thing mattered to me, so I don't recall exactly.  But I do recall writing the author (Greg Porter) about my difficulties in deriving the exact formulas from the charts, and the possibility of some of the numbers being wrong.  Drove me crazy, because I was trying to create a spreadsheet to do all the math, and my curve-fitting software couldn't account for some of the numbers, which turned out be heavily rounded for simplicity.

And that's an <b>easy</b> one:  "Multiplying something's size uniformly in all dimensions by X will multiply its surface area by X-square and its volume (and weight) by X-cubed."  Instead they make a temporary swap-variable of "Multiplier" ... apparently to confuse and frustrate.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it's just because I grew up with it, but I found Champion's Advantage/Limit system for fancifying powers to be fairly elegant.  You would divide the total points by the <b>sum</b> of the limits, and multiply it by the <b>sum</b> of the advantages.  That way, the more you limited it, the less impact each new limit had (adding a 1-point limit to a power that already had 3 points of limits would mean that you divided by 5 instead of by 4 ... which isn't anywhere near as much an impact as dividing by 2 rather than by 1), but likewise buffing up a power did not become an impossible exercise in geometrically increasing price.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was made a bit wild and wonky because the limits and advantages were measured in quarter-points ... so you'd be dividing (fairly frequently) by things like "one and three quarters."  Divide 57 points by one-and-three-quarters, then multiply it by one and one quarter.  It can be done, but it's not either fun or efficient (much better, in fact, to simply say "Okay, you start with four points of limits and four points of advantages ... if you add to either one then you must multiply the cost by the advantages <b>and</b> divide it by the limits" ... that way the calculation above becomes "57 points times 5, then divided by 7" and I get 41 (rounding up) much more quickly)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, even so, the fundamental math was pretty damn elegant, and <i>some</i> of its unintuitive complexity was clearly necessary to make that work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73308/#Comment_73308" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-02T02:15:21+00:00" title="June  2, 2007  2:15AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IIRC when Intangible in Golden Heroes your damage divider was 11.

Our first iteration retained some for Traveller-feel but it didn't play well and we realised we never liked it much as part of tactical combat anyway.

Indeed, it was <i>so</i> known that one of the books (Champions 2, I think?) actually had sidebars ("Goodman's Guide to Building Better Characters", or something like that) which described the main "tweaks".  I remember one of them was "Constitution helps build strong characters in five ways!"  Another was about choosing an optimum Dexterity, and the rounding breakpoints were talked about as well...<br/><br/>Of course, being the little fifteen-year-old rules lawyer/munchkin I was then, I took things a step farther.  Since the game said that a value of X.5 was rounded in favor of the players, and since the fact that Comeliness cost 1/2 point per level indicated that you could spend fractions of points, I'd do things like spend 1.5 points for my last point of Speed instead of 3.  You could save a good 20 or 30 points on a character that way.<br/><br/>For extra fun, since halves were rounded in favor of the players, if the GM managed to mind-control my character or something like that, all of his scores would immediately round down!  God, I was an evil little bastard...                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Metal%20Fatigue" title="Metal Fatigue"><img alt="Metal Fatigue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://msen.com/~sethb/xkcd-sqrt-love.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Metal%20Fatigue">Metal Fatigue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73352/#Comment_73352" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-02T10:58:28+00:00" title="June  2, 2007 10:58AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The example Jason cites from Classic Traveller is well within my comfort zone, but there were several pages of (what impressed me as) pointless crap in Book 6: Scouts.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I <i>loved</i> the "Fire, Fusion and Steel" supplement for TNE (a 128-page book of charts, tables, equations and a little supporting text that offered design rules for everything from sidearms to starships), to the point of spending a great deal of time on house rules to convert FFS vehicle and starship designs back into MegaTraveller stats.

Meaning everybody else can be guaranteed to not give a fuck and get bored by it. (Interestingly, this includes physics majors.)<br/><br/>There was a good amount of this in <i>Transhuman Space</i>. Okay, I probably embraced more math than was actually even in the books. <i>GURPS Traveller: First In</i> also features an astonishing amount of mathematical forumlae. I've got a bunch of physics crib sheets, spreadsheets, and software for computing all kinds of things like delta-V for interplanetary travel, Hohmann transfers, spin gravity, orbital period for an object of arbitrary mass, and so forth.<br/><br/>Basically, it's "math homework."<br/><br/>This kind of stuff is really pretty splendid for solitaire world-building, where you don't have other people waiting around for you to work through all the math. But there's no surer way to get people to lose interest in the game than breaking out the graphing calculator and getting into some heavy physics porn.<br/><br/>What's really weird about the Traveller thing is that they've gone to great length the make the sci-fi tech subordinate to easy play handling. All jumps conveniently take a week, it conveniently takes about a week to do your business in-system... for pretty much anything, you can just say "Oh, it takes you a week to do that." Really elegant and board-gamey. And then they drop this crazy math in, which seems to have no direct impact on actually playing the game. It's a pretty classic case study in a game drifting to Simulationism as new material is released.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73401/#Comment_73401" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-02T19:24:05+00:00" title="June  2, 2007  7:24PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember loving all that stuff in my sci fi games.
