I'd like to post about it here and get some reactions.  (You ever notice how, for some reason, if you write a game in a short amount of time that you become consumed with a need for feedback about it?  What is with that?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI've posted the rules on my LiveJournal:  <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://americanwizard.livejournal.com/10441.html?view=7369#t7369" rel="nofollow">http://americanwizard.livejournal.com/10441.html?view=7369#t7369</a><br/>\n(they had to spill over into the comments)<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>WHAT THE GAME IS ABOUT</i><br/>\n<br/>\nAll the players take on the roles of made-up famous novelists.  Let\u2019s assume that all these novelists have been well-acquainted for about 10 years, and also that, when it comes to their art, they are talented, popular, and critically acclaimed.  None of these novelists have finished a book in quite some time.  Why not?  Due to the unspeakable horror of the literary life, they have become too distracted.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince these novelists are talented, popular, and critically acclaimed, readers everywhere are champing at the bit for them to come out with a new book\u2014but there\u2019s not enough buzz to go around, and whoever gets a book out first will steal the others\u2019 thunder and get all the glory.  Enter all manner of passive aggression, undercutting, sabotage, backstabbing, aggressive aggression, intrigue, and shaky alliances.  Who can cut through the distraction, survive the warfare, and keep the others down long enough to get their book finished first?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>WHAT\u2019S SO HORRIFYING ABOUT THE LITERARY LIFE?</i><br/>\n<br/>\n*Your floors become strewn with page upon crumpled page of horrible, horrible prose that you are ashamed to have originate from your hand.  You will burn them presently.<br/>\n<br/>\n*One of your best ideas, it turns out, completely ruins the last act of the book, and must be cut out.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Book signings.  Not so bad in concept, except when people have you sign their arm and return to show you that they have made it a tattoo.  Or when you sprain your wrist and people curse your name because you couldn\u2019t stand the pain long enough to sign their copy.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Your family makes unexpected visits when you are in the best possible spirits to get some work done.  Now you can\u2019t, because you have to show them around Brussels, or Rome, or L.A., or wherever it is you have decided to live in search of inspiration.<br/>\n<br/>\n*You run out of coffee at precisely the wrong times.<br/>\n<br/>\n*You write a sentence that suddenly seems familiar \u2013 have you accidentally plagiarized it?  You search your library feverishly trying to find a clue to its authorship, and all the while horrible thoughts race through your head.  You will be sued!  Your career will be ruined, your credibility dashed!  People will pelt you with stones from the street!<br/>\n<br/>\n*You discover a copy of your first novel at a bookseller\u2019s, in the bargain bin.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Your fictional characters begin manifesting at the top of your stairs late at night.<br/>\n<br/>\n*You re-read your current draft and realize that it is AWFUL.  It could not have originated from your hand by any stretch of the imagination, surely.  You will burn it presently.<br/>\n<br/>\n*You take up smoking again.  You run out of cigarettes at preceisely the wrong times.<br/>\n<br/>\n*You are so overwrought that your behavior has become so unpleasant that your friends hate you.  Because of this, you hate your friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n*For some reason, the television set is on.  What you see on it inevitably enrages you, and yet you cannot find the will to stop watching it.  You will waste the entire afternoon berating talk shows and soap operas.  You even pick up the telephone and say something on a call-in show that you will regret.<br/>\n<br/>\n*A distant cousin that you cannot remember will see that call-in show and call you about your remark.  Then he comes to visit.<br/>\n<br/>\n*You are so overwrought that your spouse and/or lover refuses to remain in the same room with you.  Because of this, you hate him/her.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Your fictional characters begin manifesting in your kitchen, where they drink the last of your coffee.  They then raid your cigarettes.  Finally they go to sleep on your couch without extinguishing their cigarettes.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Parties thrown by other literati, where you are compelled to mingle with authors you do not recognize, do not know, or wish you did not know.  All conversation revolves around how incredible my next book will be, inane or outright inhuman reviews, how other authors are losing their touch, ineffectual publicity, paltry royalties, and, of course, the unspeakable horror of the literary life.  Everyone is boring, but you wonder if this is merely because you are boring.<br/>\n<br/>\n*You realize that you are getting older every minute, which can only mean that your talent is slowly dwindling.  Maybe it\u2019s already gone.<br/>\n<br/>\n*You receive a letter from your publisher wondering when the new book will be finished.  You will burn it presently and dance around the ashes.<br/>\n<br/>\n*The preliminary sketch of what will be the cover art for your new book is hideous and throroughly inappropriate.  Furthermore, it is too late to do anything about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Interviews, in which you will be asked questions you have answered a million times and questions for which you have not prepared an answer.  The former will bore you to catatonia.  The latter, while rare, will stun you so sharply that you will be unable to do anything but stammer, grunt, and sound like a fool on NPR.<br/>\n<br/>\n*You are so overwrought that you have driven away everyone you care about and who cares about you.  Because of this, you hate yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n*At some point, you must either finish this damned book or admit that you are no longer a writer.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158056/#Comment_158056" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-23T04:58:14+00:00" title="July 23, 2008  4:58AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2008 4:59AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, that's very cool.

I'm glad you like the trait lists, I'm really fond of them too.  I mean, it's already fun when you're just picking from them.  A funny aside:  a friend of mine looked at the lists and said, "I would need to look some of those up."  I said, "That's a <i>feature</i>."<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd mandatory doubling of one Unpleasant Trait doesn't sound like a bad idea!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm halfway expecting and halfway wanting someone to ask me, "5 unpleasant and 3 pleasant?  Jeez, what is it you have against novelists?"  So that I can reply in my stand-up comic voice, "I <i>dated</i> one."<br/>\n<br/>\nUnpleasant traits:  Tactless (double), forgetful, stubborn, fretful<br/>\nPleasant traits:  Sharp, hip, attractive<br/>\nPeculiar trait:  Complete David Bowie fan-girl                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
