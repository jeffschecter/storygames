Recently though, in a half-awake, half-asleep state I had the notion of doing it with a percentile system. Once I was fully awake I explored it a bit more, thought it through and I think I might have come up with something that might be worth pursuing.<br/><br/>So, here's a few things that result in doing it with a percentile base - levels are taken out of the equation, and suddenly there's the potential that Vancian magic works. My problem was never with the fire and forget aspect of it, but more with the fact that you might have your one spell completely fizzle due to saving throws. I haven't read any Jack Vance, but my understanding is that the spells all just worked. A lightning bolt would kill, anyone knew prismatic spray, and so on. So even a starting wizard could cast wish - if he successfully learns the spell, but it's a very hard spell to get your hands on. A wizard would have 1-4 spells to cast per day (I'll skip the reasoning for that number now), and each of these spells would be a guaranteed success. This makes any wizard very dangerous, potentially, but at the same time with limited spells the wizard couldn't actually stare down an army.<br/><br/>Guaranteed spell success also makes material spell components interesting - a wizard might know a lightning bolt spell, but to cast it he has to get his hands on an expensive crystal rod that's consumed in the casting. Going through the extra steps of finding the spell components is actually worth it if you know the spell actually will solve your problems.<br/><br/>Next, for fighters, use the weapons from BECMI, I only discovered this with Dark Dungeons, but it has a really neat thing with different weapons having status effects, like stun and delay. So a fighter would wish to have access to a number of weapons with different range, damage type and special effects for tactics purposes, and suddenly weapon proficiency becomes interesting instead of tedious. Also, with a BRP style percentile system you could have a starting fighter who's very proficient in sword fighting, able to hold his own with a weapon master in a sword fight, but the weapon master knows 8-10 weapons at that level and is able to deal with a wide variety of situations, while the starting sword fighter might come across some enemies that can't be easily defeated with a sword.<br/><br/>Both fighters and wizards have a similar goal - learning more things, in the case of wizards it's spells and fighters it's weapon proficiencies, but they make them more versatile and as a result more competent. The difference is the wizard has a few instances of guaranteed and overwhelming success, while the fighter has no guarantees but is consistent and can keep going indefinitely.<br/><br/>Thieves don't need to change much, they're already pretty interesting as is and have high starting competence in a couple areas, so it's really more that fighters and wizards are being brought in line with the thieves.<br/><br/>I figure for now keep clerics out of the equation - it gets complicated, and is just as easy to just have white mages and black mages. <br/><br/>So here's my picture of what it would be like - the power gamer likes the wizard, the butt kicker likes the fighter, the tactitian likes the thief, and the specialist might like any one of them. When a new character joins he's created the same way as any other, and while he's just as competent, or close to as competent as the veteran, he's less versatile. There's still a pay-off for not dying but it also isn't quite as painful as joining a new 1st level character with an 8th level party. The mechanics also reflect the stories that are told in D&amp;D settings a bit more. Leveling up isn't really represented in any FR books I've read, and the spells usually work as intended - saves don't really factor in.<br/><br/>Does this strike anyone else as an interesting idea?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289631/#Comment_289631" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T14:54:03+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  2:54PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes and no. All the changes that you talk about could be really good things if your looking for a certain type of play, but percentile dice neither make them more or less doable. For instance, how does a percentile system make "spells always work" any more doable than a system that uses a d20 (basically, % in 5% increments) or any other dice mechanic? Also, nothing here is spectacularly new. Not that matters all that much, I'm just noting it because implementation is going to be more important than innovation in determining how successful this design, or any other, is going to be. I do like the idea of modeling the D&amp;D novels more closely, I've read the early Salvatore and Dragon Lance stuff and enjoyed it immensely at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to summarize:<br/>\n"Yes, I like the direction your going in. It suits my tastes."<br/>\n"No, none of this is new. It will depend on how you actually implement it in design."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289634/#Comment_289634" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T15:07:28+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  3:07PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2010 3:08PM by migo.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not an effect that percentile has per se, just that once I thought about doing it with percentile systems removing levels made sense - I was just mentioning how I got to the idea and didn't explain that clearly enough.

If you don't have the crystal rod you can't cast your lightning bolt, so depending on how long it takes to put the components together to make a spell work one might not even need to restrict the mage to N spells per day.  The spells that can be cast repeatedly for cheap are low powered and easy to find components for (think Gandalf's flaming projectiles: needed: Fire Element focus and something flammable to throw).  They don't do much damage by themselves, but are deadly if the environment is flammable.  Great for driving off wolves while hiding in pine trees, but not useful if all you have is drift wood and the Kraken after you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/YunusWesley" title="YunusWesley"><img alt="YunusWesley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://webdrive.service.emory.edu/users/ywesley/cslogo.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/YunusWesley">YunusWesley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291424/#Comment_291424" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T11:59:37+00:00" title="September  3, 2010 11:59AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>I've kicked around multiple ideas for a retro-clone or combination of various editions, but I always reach a point where I'm thinking I might as well use an entirely different system with the changes I want to make.
