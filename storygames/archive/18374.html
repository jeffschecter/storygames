In other words what, basically, are the differences between them, and, as an entry level indie small press publisher, which one should I pump for?

(And maybe PAX and PAX East now make it Big Five?)<br/><br/>Origins is much more gaming oriented, with a broader range of games in play and promotion. Also, being the first Big Three, it's where a lot of new product lines launch, so if you're into free or cheap gear, it's the one to consider first.<br/><br/>GenCon is massive, but it's also highly dominated by TSR/Hasbro (D&amp;D). That's it real origin; and that's its biggest draw, from my (limited) experience. That said, it's also The Grandaddy of Cons, and so a lot of other major and minor and independent companies go big with promotions and organized events, including parties. (It seems that Gen Con gets the lion's share of indie scene events, but that's all subjective on my part; no stats to back it up!)<br/><br/>Dragon*Con is much broader in scope than just gaming, though its gaming is Very Big (like, most of the basement of a major hotel plus half a floor or another hotel, typically). I would say, if you want more pick-up or free-play options, it's the one to attend. Plus, there's much more cosplay, parties, movies, concerts, etc--Dragon*Con in more of a "geek interests" con than just "gaming" con. Also, Cruxshadows. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Take all of the above with a grain of salt, though--everyone's experiences differ and that affects perceptions. Your best bet would be (a) do a social poll of your acquaintances in the States and find out where they are going, then (b) carefully review all information on the web sites, to be sure you're going to have stuff to do with them at your chosen con other than play pick-up games with each other. Not that that's a waste of a con experience... but you can do that any time, without all the con expenses. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414118/#Comment_414118" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-15T07:58:51+00:00" title="May 15, 2013  7:58AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My two cents are:<br/>Origins is the scrappy smaller convention that is expanding and proving itself.  Lots of fun, but little polish.<br/><br/>GenCon has long since "made it" and is more heavily retail oriented.  You can more easily get lost in all there is to do at GenCon, whether you like that kind of thing is up to you.<br/><br/>If you want to connect with people who are there to game, and might also want to buy what you are selling, I would go to Origins.<br/><br/>If you want to connect with people who are there to purchase the latest White Wolf supplement, the newest Dominion expansion, and might be interested in buying your stuff too if they have money left over, or time to hit the dealer's room after the "games they came there to play," go to GenCon.<br/><br/>Take that as you will.

Of course as a small press prepare to be ignored by the vast majority of attendees. Booths are cheaper at Origins but the costs are similar (cons are expensive). Both are old established cons where all kinds of games are played. Historically Gen Con was the RPG con and Origins the Board Game con. That is still somewhat true. Indie RPG stuff happens at both but there are more Indie game company dealer booths at Gen Con. Some of the big companies have skipped Origins in recent years so financially they are more tenuous.<br/><br/>I go to Origins to play and run games. My brother lives in Columbus so it's a cheap trip and I get to see family. I like Columbus. If I ever left Indiana I'd probably move there. The convention center is big and well kept up. There are great food options at the North Market a block from the convention center. Ohioans are friendly and the down town is not crawling with pan handlers. Nice place. <br/><br/>I go to Gen Con to sell so I'm tied to my booth much of the time, when it was in Milwaukee I attended Gen Con the way I attend Origins now. I live pretty close to Indy but due to booth work we are getting a down town hotel this year, an expensive proposition. Indy is an okay city but there is the local joke that is it India-no-place or Nap Town. Outside of the Con you might not find a lot to do, but the Con is freaking huge. There is way too much to see and do. You have to plan what you want and do it. This means missing a lot. The dealers area is huge and has a lot of stuff that you will not see anywhere else - especially from small companies. It also has a lot of non-game stuff (utility kilts, swords, and stuffed dragons toys at my booth (they pay the rent!) The food options in Indy are more than Columbus. The food court is meh but is open till 9 or so. There are lots of restaurants cheap and expensive. In the past there were a lot of pan handlers down town but I understand the police are pushing them out this summer, so they might not be a problem. They never gave me any issues in the past, they follow the rules (make your pitch and don't pursue of the person says no or walks on). <br/><br/>Personally I picked Gen con over Origins for many years. It is the bigger show but it depends on what you are after. PAX East and Prime sound way cool to but are just too far away to make it. I've always heard good things about Dragon Con to and Atlanta is a wonderful city. <br/><br/>I think you can't go wrong no matter which one you pick.<br/><br/>Chris Engle/Hamster Press                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414121/#Comment_414121" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-15T10:13:25+00:00" title="May 15, 2013 10:13AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2013 10:15AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Origins is a very pleasant, laid back play-focused convention. It is in a beautiful town with much to recommend it. If you have to choose between Origins and Gen Con and are there to play and enjoy life, choose Origins.<br/><br/>Gen Con is a generally unpleasant sales convention. It is in an ugly town with little to recommend it. There's a ton of stuff to do, see and buy and it can be overwhelming. If you want to meet everyone and buy everything, Choose Gen Con.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend Dragon Con, which has outgrown its available space to an alarming degree and is in no way focused on gaming.<br/><br/>Also consider an east coast convention like Dreamation, which is more accessible from Europe and offers high quality gaming.<br/><br/>As a publisher consider partnering with a company or group of people buying a booth at any or all of these shows, like IPR. I think unless you have a lot of interest and awareness already from the gaming public, buying your own space at any of these shows will be a waste of money.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael_Hopcroft" title="Michael_Hopcroft"><img alt="Michael_Hopcroft" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael_Hopcroft">Michael_Hopcroft</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414127/#Comment_414127" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-15T12:45:47+00:00" title="May 15, 2013 12:45PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't been to either of those shows in a decade.

I'm beginning to form a picture of the differences between two events. I think in terms of sheer numbers GenCon seems to have it, but Origins is more play-orientated. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">@MatrixGamer</a> I see why you've plumped for GenCon, it's a marketing decision based on the sales focus, but given the apparent WotC/Hasbro/TSR slant (not surprising gven its location), I don't think it would work for me, as for the forseeable future I'm likely to be producing quirky, off-the-wall games with innovative but at times bizarre-seeming mechanics- hence why I like this forum particularly- and I don't think the overwhelmingness would appeal to me, so probably Origins would be a better bet.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I knew a little bit about Origins before becoming a roleplayer because I was on Boardgamegeek for a few years and got to know (online) a guy from CABS (the Columbus Area Boardgame Society), and formed a vague plan of maybe rocking up there one day. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">@Jason_Morningstar</a> I take your point about trying an East Coast con- PAX East has been on my radar for a while now thanks to various posts on this forum.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Michael_Hopcroft">@Michael_Hopcroft</a> The con scene in the UK is constrained by the fact that not only do the transport links not encourage criss-cross travel, they are also hideously expensive. After a period of wrangling among various parties, GenCon imploded in 2008, and was replaced by a con called UK Games Expo, which is largely a commercial venture and, as I've mentioned before, doesn't smile on small press indie gaming but is nevertheless a enjoyable con. Its focus is in fact more on boardgames than RPGs. The other major national games con is Dragonmeet, which takes place in West London at the beginning of December, and is operated by the guys behind Cubicle 7. Despite the website being legendarily slow to get updated, Dragonmeet is very well organised and very popular, and accepting of all kinds of games- I got a full table for Where The Heart Is last year- as well as having talks, seminars and a thriving trade hall. Because the numbers are much lower than either Origins or GenCon- I'm not sure exactly how many but it's less than 2'000- the relaxation factor is pretty high. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a> Yes, we have those sorts of cons here in the UK, in fact the vast preponderance of con gaming, especially small press indie- we have a lot of home-grown talent as I'm sure you're aware- takes place at these kinds of cons. Numbers vary from 50-300 so they're all pretty relaxed <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414145/#Comment_414145" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-15T21:39:57+00:00" title="May 15, 2013  9:39PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2013 9:40PM by Andy.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Jason said time one hundred. <br/><br/>Every event I scheduled through Origins as a GM got messed up save one; no one in their Help Desk actually could do anything to help, at all, with anything, ever. But the city is great: Great vibe, great food, the con is laid back, and it's just flat-out a fun time. Unless your events are fucking trashed because of inept planners/organizers. Still, small burn, and pound for pound it beats a hot, small, smelly city.<br/><br/><b>Dreamation</b> and <b>Dexcon</b> (same con, just one in Winter, one in Summer and coming up soon!) are absolute marvels. The town is wonderful, the con is extremely laid back, open, and super gaming-focused. Everyone is enthusiastic, motivated, and friendly. I kinda swore off cons for a while, but I was like, "screw it, let me give Dexcon a shot". Amazing. Totally got me back into being interested in the convention experience. I can't recommend Dexcon/Dreamation highly enough.<br/><br/>Due to work issues, there's only a 30% chance or so I'll make it to DexCon this year, but I'm already planning on Dreamation next year as a Must. <b>It's worth flying over the Atlantic to attend</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414146/#Comment_414146" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-15T22:31:39+00:00" title="May 15, 2013 10:31PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Origins used to be the littlest big convention or the biggest little one, very friendly, full of plenty of stuff to do. GenCon was and is big and loud and wonderful. Some years, we'd do both. Some years, we'd pick one.<br/><br/>But I have noticed Origins shrinking, and the staff, ah... boasting about how the dealers' room is full, while shrinking the size and increasing the empty space, which is a bit disingenuous. Then, there was the date change, which meant, last year, a lot of GMs who run stuff couldn't go because their kids were in school.<br/><br/>This had the secondary effect of keeping Looney Labs away. Too many of the staff had school or kids in school. As Looney Labs is a big part of why my partner loves Origins, and as we are insane in the number of conventions we do, we gave it a miss last year and will do so again this year. Next year, I don't know. We won't do 2014 GenCon because it conflicts with the London WorldCon. So, we might do Origins. On the other hand, that's the year it's our turn to run the Floating East Coast Filking Convention, which is rather close to DexCon in time. So, we may be overcommitted.<br/><br/>I don't know if my issues with a shrinking Origins are yours. It's still got plenty of cool people and good stuff to do. I go to game and shop.<br/><br/>GenCon has better shopping overall, but Origins may be better on specific things. Origins is better on onsite food options. I do both as a gamer, not a vendor or publisher. For me, there are two ways to do GenCon:<br/><br/>1.  Get into lots of specific events.<br/>2.

Just thought of another consideration - the date. Gen Con is in early August in Indianapolis. While July is the hottest month of the year, August comes in a close second. On good days the temperature will be in the 80's but it can easily go into the 90's of even 100. The humidity will be between 90% to 100% (probably more the latter). Outside of air conditioning you will wilt. There tend to be afternoon rain showers that come out of the blue. Weird showers where it rains hard with full sunlight at the same time. Downtown Indy is a heat island so... it can be uncomfortable. Origins is now in early June - much nicer weather!<br/><br/>This weather doesn't bother me but I'm from here and my family have been here over two hundred years (so the one's who couldn't handle it died). Coming straight from the UK to this could be hard.<br/><br/>That being said Gen Con is still a great show, and Indy for all it's faults is not a bad city. I just think people should know what to expect if they come.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414162/#Comment_414162" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-16T06:38:04+00:00" title="May 16, 2013  6:38AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've gone to both the past two years, actually. <br/><br/><b>Origins</b> local to me so I'm totally biased about it: I live in Columbus. Buuuuuuut, I've been going to this convention for like, approximately 15 years now. I used to drive from Philly (about 8 hours) to attend larps here when I was younger. People used to come from all over actually. It used to be bigger than it is. But, despite the fact that it's not so big anymore, it's the more fun RPG and larp gaming experience of the two, in my opinion. The indie scene has grown significantly in the past few years, although it was always there. Columbus is an indie town too, so I think it's got a good influence on that feel. The community has been consistent over the years, and there's always interesting guests and the art show is good, and the local midwest vibe permeates. It's definitely been unorganized in the past (there's been some drama in the organization, so the rumors go), although this year promises to be better (pre registration went smoothly and without a hitch for the first time in three years), and working with the organizers has been a pleasure so far. I'm hopeful it's on an upswing. There's free time to costume, hang out, try new games, get dinners and drinks and such. Columbus is a nice city to walk around for a bit.<br/><br/><b>Gencon</b> is much bigger, more industry driven, has far more people at it. There is far too much to do here and you'll never get it all done, so just roll with the flow and schedule as much as you can and hardly eat or sleep. More people come from across the states (and globe) for this convention. The halls are so crowded during the day you can hardly maneuver through the cosplay photos and people carrying big bags of games. They have concerts (klingon opera, video game orchestra in the past), their venues are cooler (one hotel is an old train!), and it takes place in like, four hotels and a convention center instead of just a convention center. It can be kinda stressful though, it's way more high energy, and people tend to be there to network and sell stuff. If you're looking to make connections and sell your wares, Gencon might be better for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414171/#Comment_414171" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-16T08:42:30+00:00" title="May 16, 2013  8:42AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2013 8:50AM by catty_big.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa Padol said:<blockquote>We won't do 2014 GenCon because it conflicts with the London WorldCon.

I haven't done Origins myself, but everything I've heard indicates that it's a much less sales-intensive convention. To my understanding this does not somehow translate into "so that's where a small press publisher should be" - at least not if you've got sales goals to meet. Gencon is where customers go expecting to make purchases, which makes all the difference in finding people willing to try quirky new things.<br/><br/>(I've got quite some experience with small conventions at this point. My general observation is that WotC not having a booth at a convention does not magically cause customers to flock to your booth; it just means that it's not a sales convention, and people likely did not come with commerce in mind in the first place. A commercial convention is much more expensive for you than a smaller convention, but the sales are also a magnitude higher.)<br/><br/>As for Gencon being somehow narrow-minded and only accepting of big-name games, I have to say that this is not my experience in any significant way. The alpha customers of the American gaming scene go there, so if that's your target audience, then what can you do? You could avoid meeting your target audience, I guess, by not going to the same convention with them. Somehow I don't think that this would help sales any. You already made the decision of not being the most appealing game in the convention by not being the newest edition of D&amp;D, but this does not mean that it's a good idea to go to a smaller or less sales-oriented convention.<br/><br/>In general a booth at these big conventions is too much of an investment to be profitable for an indie publisher, unless you're very exceptional. It is more feasible to get together with half a dozen other like-minded publishers to share the costs and the booth: this way you'll have more product catalogue to present, and more workers to run the booth. This is what the Forge booth did over the last decade, mostly pretty successfully.<br/><br/>As for what one might expect to sell at Gencon: in my experience a solid indie working from a joint booth with a bunch of other people might expect to sell a couple dozen copies of their game. If it's a particularly appealing game (the right genre, appealing pitch, the product looks solid, the booth crew is energetic, etc.), then 50-100 copies is not unrealistic. If it looks amateurish, has a dull topic and the salesperson is passive, then it's entirely possible to come out of Gencon joint booth with 5 sales or less. For multiple titles, you might figure that each additional title after the first one adds e.g. 20% to your sales total - that's a guess, but the number won't be very big, regardless, as the limiting factor in convention sales is your ability to initiate sales interactions and close sales, not whether the customer has only one choice or five as to what to buy. If I had to guesstimate the sales for an indie booth (that is, a booth selling works with no brand appeal, only the sales force and novelty on their side) at a 4-day large convention like Gencon or Spiel Essen, I'd assume 20*[1+0.1*the number of products] sales per person involved in the booth, to a maximum of 20 per square meter of booth size.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414182/#Comment_414182" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-16T12:37:46+00:00" title="May 16, 2013 12:37PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yea, what Eero and Chris and others have said about selling. Booths are expensive at Gencon, indie people usually group up. I think it depends on your games, their audience, how established they are, and if a big company is making them. Usually I hear people talking about D&amp;D, Warhammer, Miniatures games and board games at Gencon. There's some indie releases there every year too. I don't really have experience selling, just have witnessed what tactics other indie people have utilized at these conventions. <br/><br/>The big indie booth at Origins tends to be IPR. Then there's smaller booths and a new designer alley that are for first timers (I think they had this at Gencon too?). I'm not sure how their sales are in comparison to Gencon, or have a really good feel for sales differences between the two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414184/#Comment_414184" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-16T13:57:35+00:00" title="May 16, 2013  1:57PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't you miss the days of the Forge Booth.

Some great people go, there are fun games available and there's great food in Columbus.<br/><br/>If you want to run a booth and sell games, Origins is horrible. Seriously. We only started to enjoy Origins when we gave up trying to man a booth and sell games there. We started just running lots of games instead and letting a company like IPR take a cut in exchange for selling it for us. <br/><br/>I'd lay you even money that as a new small press publisher, you stand a much better chance of selling enough games to recoup your expenses at Dreamation than you would at Origins. Plus you'll meet a bunch of nice folks. Even though it's small, Dreamation is a pretty good place to start.<br/><br/>Gen Con is like drinking from a fire hose. There's just more of everything. The food options suck, the town smells and it's hard work. But you can sell a lot of games there if you have a recognized name or you've managed to generate some buzz about your game ahead of time. That said, don't expect to make a profit there. It's really, really expensive for a booth and hotel/travel for your staff (you need to bring enough people to man your booth and give them breaks). You can mitigate some of that expense by going in on a booth with other companies, but even then it's rare to do much better than break even. It can be good marketing if you care about that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Pax East can be a good, middle-of-the-road choice between these options. It's already big and it's getting bigger. In my experience, people at Pax East come to get demos of games. The vast majority are there for video games; however, many are interested in trying fun things, whether they're digital or not. As long as you don't mind occasionally explaining what a pen-and-paper RPG is, you're likely to get a lot of people who are willing to give your game a go.

Seriously. We only started to enjoy Origins when we gave up trying to man a booth and sell games there. We started just running lots of games instead and letting a company like IPR take a cut in exchange for selling it for us. </blockquote>\nI think this is the answer as far as Origins is concerned: play games with folks- as I\u2019ve said earlier this is ultimately the best way to sell games- and have someone else (IPR or similar) man a booth in exchange for a cut.<br/>\n<blockquote>Gen Con is \u2026  really, really expensive for a booth and hotel/travel for your staff (you need to bring enough people to man your booth and give them breaks). You can mitigate some of that expense by going in on a booth with other companies, but even then it's rare to do much better than break even. <b>It can be good marketing if you care about that sort of thing.</b></blockquote>[My bolding]<br/><br/>This is the point: you might not make much money in sales, but simply having a presence at a con with that many peeps is kind of equivalent to advertising. And, at an event where you don\u2019t make your booth cost, who\u2019s to say that your mere presence there- talking to folks, networking and hopefully making a good impression- won\u2019t yield follow-up sales?<br/><br/>Regarding the food options: while I'm at a con trying to shift product my mind is focused laser-like on that so alimentary considerations are not high on the list, but, in general, if I went to Origins, from what folks have been saying here, it sounds like I'd enjoy being there more than at GenCon. <br/><br/>However, I see I\u2019ve been guilty of grabbing at the obvious candidates and not considering the smaller up and coming cons like PAX and Dreamation- it might be worth starting at one of those and moving up/across to GenCon/Origins later on when I\u2019m a bit more established.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414241/#Comment_414241" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-17T09:02:28+00:00" title="May 17, 2013  9:02AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad I don't smell it!<br/><br/>I wonder if it has anything to do with the river and canal?
