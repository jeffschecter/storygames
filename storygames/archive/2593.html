The text itself is in good shape.  It's been reviewed by two Poles for errors of fact and grammar - BWHQ's Radek Drozdalski has been extra-helpful and corrected all my swear words.  The final book will be perfect bound, 6x9, and I'm guessing about 125 pages.  <br/><br/>Eight of the 10 interior art pieces are done and I couldn't be happier with Jeff Bent's work.  <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/grey_ranks/art/GunfightFinal_web.jpg" rel="nofollow">Here's a particularly gonzo piece</a> - that's Janek; he's 15.  One thing I'm very excited about is that the interior art is sequential, following the extended <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/grey_ranks/shemya/gr_5.6_examples.pdf" rel="nofollow">examples of play</a> in the book and telling the story of a Grey Ranks crew visually.  The "gunfight" piece takes place on 1 August, 1944, as the example crew gets in a firefight in Szucha Alley, outside Gestapo headquarters.  <br/><br/>The mechanics are solid now after loads of playtesting, and I'm doing a <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23427.0" rel="nofollow">final hardcore test</a> before giving it to the Mad Irishman to lay out at the end of the month.  So I'm guessing that I'll have books for sale by Camp Nerdly, first of May.  I have to say I've never been more excited or proud of a project.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59524/#Comment_59524" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T06:34:45+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  6:34AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>First, great news and congrats!<br/><br/>Secondly, can you explain to me (or point me to elsewhere) the playtest process you have gone through so far?

First of all my first draft was a Game-Chef-esque local contest entry in the fall of 2005, and that version was a train wreck.  It's been iterative and I've returned to the drawing board a couple of times.  Recently I went back and looked at early drafts and realized I've retained almost nothing.  I talk about the process a bit <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23410.0" rel="nofollow">in this thread</a>, too, which I'll repeat for convenience:<br/><br/>Here are my playtesting approaches, in descending order of quantity:<br/><br/>I have a little brain trust I bounce ideas off, and much "testing" goes on by proposing and challenging design goals and assumptions via email and face to face.<br/><br/>I've had a number of mechanical playtests, that looks like this:<br/><br/>1.  Me sitting at a desk running the game's numbers, start to finish or maybe just to test a particular portion over and over and over again. <br/>2.  Me and a couple of friends doing the same thing, until things utterly break.<br/><br/>I've run the game as a one-shot (using various points of attack) for friends and fellow travelers:<br/><br/>1.  In my living room or at an apartment con with pals.<br/>2.  At conventions for interested strangers.<br/><br/>I've solicited semi-blind tests (I'm available to clarify and answer questions before the actual session), with widely distributed play groups - thanks, guys!<br/><br/>I'm running the game absolutely straight, as intended, for my weekly game group as well, now that everything is as tight as it's realistically going to be.  We're playing our second session tomorrow night, and half my local crew has playtested various earlier iterations as well.  Grey Ranks has been in development for so long (relatively speaking) that I've gotten some pressure to just get it done, and I'm sensitive to the "better is the enemy of done" argument.  Perfection isn't a design goal, but well-tested, functional play definitely is.  Happily, I'm seeing the game deliver.  Unless the final playtest implodes or something, I think it's in good shape.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59543/#Comment_59543" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T07:08:05+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  7:08AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, Thanks for that rundown.  I read your posts over on the forge, but I was really asking about numbers: How many sessions, how many full games etc etc.  I appreciate if you don't want to discuss that kind of thing in public though.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I'm trying to write a game that's fun to play.  I'm aiming for a "playtest until you don't think there need to be any changes between tests" result, but I mean ideally there would be two or three other groups doing the same.<br/><br/>At the risk of de-railing your thread, I'm interested in another point: Getting a game ready for publishing is actually two completely different jobs: Creating a game and then writing a book which tells the reader how to play that game and make it fun.  I know there are at least three of four games I've bought which I've been assured are excellent games, but which I have not been able to fathom from the books alone.  How do you make sure that the text is working as well as the game?  Blind proofreaders is the only thing I can think of, but I can't think of a way to make sure that the reader understood the text correctly unless they play the game and report that back...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59562/#Comment_59562" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T08:13:26+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  8:13AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah, Jason!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59563/#Comment_59563" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T08:20:30+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  8:20AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blindtesting helps with the "comprehensibility" problem - anything you get a question about is almost certainly poorly written.  I also run my manuscript past two people - one an extremely detail-oriented math nerd and the other a loosey-goosey English major, neither of whom are gamers.  That's a development step I forgot to include.  If they can both make sense of it, that's reassuring.  I don't agree with your dichotomy - at least my work process has design and explanation tied together.  I can't really test something until I can also explain it on paper, but that's just me.  <br/><br/>Thinking back I think the breakdown is:<br/><br/>4 semi-blind tests of varying length, from one to three sessions<br/>10 single-session and convention games<br/><br/>Accounting for short sessions, call it 70 hours of face-to-face testing?  That's a rough estimate, anyway.  Plus mechanical tests and brainstorming sessions I cannot count - many additional hours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59567/#Comment_59567" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T08:29:01+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  8:29AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad to hear the game is entering its home stretch.

Are the Germans just like a backdrop to all of this?  Are the players going to control German NPCs for each other?  Given your recent post in another thread about Germans using Polish as human shields, how strong is the focus in the game on depicting those kinds of events?

Who those child soldiers interact with, and how that occurs, is up to the players, with systemic input.  You generate situation elements for each chapter (a technique yanked from In A Wicked Age), and many of the choices involve either groups of Germans or named individuals.  For example:<br/><br/><i>Leutnant Karl Thiel, thoughtful officer ashamed and proud of his duty</i>, which is a choice from grid position B-4 that a player could choose to offer.  Who is Lt. Thiel?  How will he appear in the game?  Entirely up to the group.  He could be sympathetic or a vicious beast.  <br/><br/>In the most recent playtest, one player was on A-4 during chapter three and chose <i>Amalia Fissler, an ambitious physician's wife and ardent Nazi</i>.  The players framed a mission that involved killing her husband, and there was a fantastic scene where this gung-ho Polish teenager vaulted their garden wall and came face-to-face with Frau Fissler, who was this charming, intelligent woman.  Frau Fissler was played by another player, when asked by the player of the guy framing the scene.  All we knew going into it was that she was an ardent Nazi, and it was enough to spur a very dramatic and cool scene.  <br/><br/>There are some situation elements that invoke Germans and leave no room for ambiguity; some are plucked from history and involve atrocities.

I certainly address the Soviet "liberation" of Warsaw, which took place in January 1945 (the game ends on 3 October, with the Polish Home Army capitulation to the Germans).  There are some situation elements related to making contact with the Red army, and their progress in eastern Poland gets mentioned throughout the game ("They're in Lwow!  They're in Radom!  They're ... sitting on their asses a kilometer away.")  The Soviets basically sat around on the east bank of the Vistula and let the Germans crush the best and brightest in Poland, then rode in and arrested any Home Army soldiers (of any age) who weren't dead or in a German POW cage.  Actually, they arrested the ones in German POW cages, too.<br/><br/>Also!

Their mission:  locate and free their old scoutmaster.  They find out he's being held in the field house of the Wola football stadium and sneak over.  The field is covered in corpses.  One of the players frames a mission scene for another guy - the field house is packed with Polish prisoners, and German guards are forcing them out, one at a time, and making them run for the exit on the opposite side - 100 meters.  On the roof, there are Germans having a party with deck chairs and sniper rifles.  And the crew is watching through field glasses, and the next Pole is shoved out the door - and of course it is the scoutmaster.  <br/><br/>So the guy in the mission scene (Segedy here at S-G) has a dilemma.  He can toss a big die at the mission to help it succeed, or he can toss a little die and basically make it fail while looking awesome himself.  But if he uses that big die, he has to narrate a personal failure.  He's the crew sniper - he's got his dad's old rifle, the symbol of everything he cares about.  There are too many Germans on the roof for him to take them all out.  So he draws down on the scoutmaster, the guy who <i>taught </i>him how to shoot,  and puts a round through his knee.  No running for him, he lives to be rescued, and the Germans are all over the crew - success and disaster all rolled into one.  It was a cool moment.  Awful but cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60504/#Comment_60504" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-11T17:48:38+00:00" title="March 11, 2007  5:48PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Awesome</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60509/#Comment_60509" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-11T19:26:58+00:00" title="March 11, 2007  7:26PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/grey.spiral" title="grey.spiral"><img alt="grey.spiral" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i148.photobucket.com/albums/s2/greySpiral/boogiepop012hushie1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/grey.spiral">grey.spiral</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60516/#Comment_60516" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-11T22:30:28+00:00" title="March 11, 2007 10:30PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have anything to add other than the fact that I am really looking forward to this.

It was probably in one of those 1970s-era encyclopedias I seemed to spend so much time reading.  It was a shot of a young man flinging a rock at a tank, perhaps in Palestine or Hungary.  But even at that age I was struck by the futility of the gesture and did not yet understand what would bring someone to risk their life in that way.  Thank you for creating a game that might help teach that understanding to others.

The real core of the game are the lists of situation elements, so re-authoring those to reflect a different time and place would be the major change necessary, provided you have a tightly constrained time and place where child soldiers fight and risk death.  The alternate setting that is obvious to me is Berlin, 1945, but I have no interest in playing that.  You could probably work up Liberia/Sierre Leone or Sudan/Somalia.  <br/><br/>Regarding your concern about replayability, the tight constraints end up being helpful in repeated play.
