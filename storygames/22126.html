I want to kick around some ideas in this thread. I will probably also X-post on RPG.net since the author may jump in.<br/><br/>I may have time to organize a second game soon, but I don't want to full-on GM a second campaign. (I'm running 5E on Thursdays.) Godbound is one of the favorite games I've learned about in recent years. Getting to actually play a PC in it again would be fabulous.<br/><br/>Doing the work of teaching the game, even with some weird GM-less structure on top, wouldn't be a problem. And designing the GM-less structure should also be fine for me, as it's the sort of challenge I really enjoy. I just don't want to put the game on the table and not get to experience the unique joys of <i>playing</i> it you know?<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm going to write a few more posts in this thread right now, laying out various obstacles and / or possible solutions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485299/#Comment_485299" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-05T03:17:43+00:00" title="June  5, 2019  3:17AM">3:17AM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, one idea would be to completely break character monogamy, and then do rotating GM stuff. Get 5 people together, collectively create 6-8 gods (enough that you feel like you have a real pantheon), and each person takes turns GMing. Based on what scenario they're presenting, the other 4 players each grab a character and explore it. Then, when the immediate scenario is finished, they go back to base, the GM changes, and the players grab new characters.<br/><br/>You could have each player have ownership over a particular part of the setting, so it's clear when each person needs to GM, or perhaps ownership over a particular conflict type.<br/><br/>Since the faction turn is pretty out-of-character anyway, all the gods could participate in the faction turns, even if they weren't played in the most recent adventure, and in fact those gods who don't participate in an adventure could gain some other small benefit, like an extra point of Dominion (god-mana, basically) for the month.<br/><br/>So, that's idea <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. For now, I think I'm mainly going to focus on possible solutions, and leave the trouble-shooting for later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485300/#Comment_485300" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-05T03:26:45+00:00" title="June  5, 2019  3:26AM">3:26AM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so, that's one possibility. Now, what if we wanted to go truly GM-less here? One nice thing is that monsters' tactics are sort of automated anyway by the system. (And they sort of need to be in order to avoid TPKs: if monsters just attack - attack - attack and never do anything interesting, they have a good chance of splatting the characters.)<br/><br/>The trickier bit is how we decide what obstacles stand in the way of the current goal the pantheon is pursuing. I think I need to do a bit of research into something like the Mythic GM Emulator. I'd also like some suggestions for good GMless games to review to be reminded of some of the best ways of handling these issues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485302/#Comment_485302" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-05T03:45:18+00:00" title="June  5, 2019  3:45AM">3:45AM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, here's a third idea. This one's a bit out there, and based on <i>Polaris</i> of all things, but I want to just throw it out there and consider it.<br/><br/>You have "pantheon scenes" where the whole pantheon, which is equal in number to the number of players, is at their base, hanging out. Those are mostly freeform roleplaying, and also Dominion and Influence spending.<br/><br/>Then you have "quest mode." For some sort of diegetic reason, not all the gods can leave on a quest at the same time. Let's say Athena and Brigid go on a quest together, while in-fiction, Cronus, Demeter, and Eros stay at base to keep things from falling apart.<br/><br/>Players C, D, and E do the following:<br/><br/>C plays the forces of chaos and destruction in the world. All that opposes the Godbound, and is on roughly their scale in terms of power.<br/><br/>D plays the environment, including all lesser monsters and beasts, the weather, and the terrain. This job includes the GM role of describing what's in a room.<br/><br/>E plays mortal NPCs, those who are not Worthy Foes to the pantheon, and who might become any of the following:<br/>-Casualties of their mighty struggles<br/>-Loyal followers of their cults<br/>-Allies and friends aided by the Godbound<br/>-Adherents of the pantheon's enemies<br/><br/>*shrug* Who knows, could work? I'm gonna sit on this for awhile.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485309/#Comment_485309" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-05T06:43:43+00:00" title="June  5, 2019  6:43AM">6:43AM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I have my <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/introducing-late-night-fighting/" rel="nofollow">monster script thing</a> if that helps\u2026?</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485320/#Comment_485320" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-05T09:34:03+00:00" title="June  5, 2019  9:34AM">9:34AM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not open the 3rd option to more freedom ?
