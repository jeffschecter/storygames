A lot. And it's a bit frustrating because I haven't found one that really fits the bill for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm looking for a system that's not tied to a genre or setting. One which offers a bit of narrative-style play (i.e. players control the outcomes of positive results) and fun gamist stuff (i.e. dice pool management). One where character's are driven and defined by characteristics, equipment, goals, etc. which are represented by descriptions which are rated with some sort of value (i.e. "Seeks revenge for father's murder" gets 5 dice). <br/>\n<br/>\nI also want a bit of a competitive nature to play, with the GM actually making an effort to defeat players, but where the challenges and the results of a failure are managed by the rules/negotiations to keep it fair and to support interesting turns of the plot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also looking for some traditional aspects, such as support for character advancement and long term play, and fairly traiditional world-building which is controlled by the GM. I want to reduce GM handwaviness and have a sensible framework for the result of actions. I want completely low prep, but it's not about shared narrative .... player-controlled narrative should be primarily limited to the results of their character's actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I want it to scale effectively from just 1 player and 1 GM, so this means no systems which are dependent upon resource sharing, shared player narrative, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome games I've looked at:<br/>\n<br/>\nFudge 2.0: Close. Aspects are cool. There doesn't seem to be enough in the way of interesting choices in static and dynamic tests. I prefer the idea of a gamist overlay that drives the narrative based on tough choices of pool management, resource management, or something of that sort.<br/>\n<br/>\nRiddle of Steel: Love the SA's, combat system is great but too crunchy. I'd like more momentum.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeast Hunters: Very cool. Good option for 1 player and 1 GM. Has a bit of a competitive vibe. But, a bit too tied to the setting without lots of revisions when I want to jump genres, and I get hung up on the social/physical/mental aspects during character creation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeroQuest: I haven't seen this game, but from what I've read the bidding system in extended contests is kind of cool. Overall. though, it seems like it's pretty strongly tied to the setting, and I'm too impatient to wait for the eventual generic version they are working on. <br/>\n<br/>\nShadow of Yesterday: Certainly has some nice bits. As stated by the author, though, primarily designed for groups of 3-6, and doesn't offer some of the bits and bobbles I'm looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Pool: Core mechanic is pretty cool. Maybe a good starting point, but not quite deep enough to my mind for extended play.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps what I need to do is sit down and invent the game I want to play, but honestly with all of the brain-straining and play-testing and such ... I'd just rather play. I feel like all of the bits I suggested are nothing new, and perhaps there's a game I haven't considred or have discarded at a glance but that might deserve a second look.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BiggerBoat" title="BiggerBoat"><img alt="BiggerBoat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BiggerBoat">BiggerBoat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143077/#Comment_143077" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T11:34:50+00:00" title="May  8, 2008 11:34AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2008 11:36AM by BiggerBoat.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All of this is pretty nebulous, so I thought the best way to proceed is to offer a fictional sample of play which represents maybe something that appeals to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: "You stride into the chamber and see Duke Raythburn sitting on his throne. He takes a sip from an ornate goblet and looks at you with disdain. He says: 'My cousin's little bastard child has come home, eh?'.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: [In Character] "The past is catching up with you, Raythburn."<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: "Two men come out of the shadows and flank the throne, protectively, each clad in mail armor and holding maces and shields at the ready. They look ready to defend the Duke. So ... what's your goal for this challenge?"<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "I want to skewer the Duke like a pig. This ends here."<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: "Okay. A failure on this challenge will mean that you're captured by the Duke. I've got 5 challenge points left, so we'll go ahead and make this the final challenge before the refresh. I'll spend them all and you'll need 5 successes to complete the challenge. The duke and his men will get 3 dice for each success, so 15 dice in my pool to start."<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "I draw my sword, activating 4 dice for my swordsmanship, and I silently call upon the sprit of my father to grant me strength. That will give me another 5 dice for my vow of vengeance. Plus, I'll use what's left of my fate pool--3 dice."<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: "Okay, that'll give you 12 dice total for the challenge. As you draw your sword the duke's men both charge you. They mean to bash you over the head. I'm spending 4 dice."<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "I'll move fast and slice at the legs of the first guard who reaches me, hoping to at least trip him up to let me focus on the second. 3 dice.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Both the DM and the player roll the d10's bid out of their pool. They are looking for matched sets or 0's, either of which indicates a positive result. ]<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "I got two positives."<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: "I only got one, which means you won that round. I also rolled a 1. [GM hands over the dice which rolled up as a 1 to the player, who adds that dice to his pool. Any 1's go directly into the opposition's pool. Spending more dice, being aggresive, can reward you in the short term but it can also act against you].<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: [won the round so gets to narrate the result]. "Okay, so I dash forward towards the center of the room. I duck as the first one swipe's at me with his mace. I spin and cut at him across the back of his knee--right at the unprotected seam of his armor. He yelps and goes down."<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: "Okay, you have initative so I'll declare first. The remaining guard is going to try to bash at you with his shield to take you off-balance. He'll follow up with a swing of his mace. 3 dice.<br/>\n<br/>\n.....<br/>\n<br/>\n[Fast forward a couple of exchanges. The Duke, a master swordsman, has managed to best the player character. The player has no more dice in his pool, and the Duke has him at swordpoint.]<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: "Surrender?"<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "No. I'm going to escalate."<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: "All right, but that will mean the new condition for failure is an injury. Something permanent and scarring. And you'll still be captured." [Each time a player chooses to escalate, the conditions for failure worsen.]<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "I'll take that chance."<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: "Okay. Your starting pool was 12 so you'll get 6 back. I'll take half of that, so 3 more dice me. I have initiative. What's your intent?"<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all without much thought and I'm not propsing a wonky D10 pool system, but you hopefully see where I'm coming from. Some nice, character-driven drama, challenge-based, some sort of pool management or maybe bidding mechanic, and a competitive vibe which gives the GM the freedom to define the consequences and actually go after the player characters with gusto.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the long posts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonP" title="JasonP"><img alt="JasonP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wishray.com/jp/the_penguin.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonP">JasonP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143080/#Comment_143080" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T11:47:08+00:00" title="May  8, 2008 11:47AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IMHO, Heroquest is just what you want.

There is a new game in development by <a href="http://www.wordplaygames.co.uk/index.html" rel="nofollow">Wordplay Games</a> in UK called - not by coincidence - Wordplay which might be what you are looking for. Here is the author's pitch:\n<blockquote>Wordplay is a simple to play D6 dice pool generic roleplaying game currently in development and playtest including at several British conventions. Wordplay features the following:<br/><br/>1. Free flowing character creation using descriptive phrases and words called 'traits' which are then split between Body Mind and Soul categories.<br/>2. A fun dice building mechanic. Describe what your character is doing and make use of as many advantages as possible to build your hand of dice.<br/>3. Roll your dice and get as many successes as possible - highest wins. Only the dice that land on the table count!<br/>4. Create goals for your characters and drive them forward to succeed.<br/>5. Pre-designed 'themes' - ready made settings to inspire you to create and play straight away<br/><br/>Wordplay focuses on how descriptions of characters affect play at your gaming table. Instead of numerous mechanistic modifiers the game presents narrative opportunities which are translated into dice for your characters. It's light, open and encourages story telling and vivid descriptions around the table.<br/><br/>The text for the game is planned to be completed by close 2008 for a 2009 release. Inspiration has come from such disparate gaming sources as 'HeroQuest', 'Burning Wheel', 'The D6 System' and 'The Conspiracy of Shadows'. A new roleplaying game coming in 2009.</blockquote>\nCurrently the game is being discussed at <a href="http://www.gamingtavern.eu/tav/viewforum.php?f=48&amp;sid=81fb7409fffc11b5379859b3d7039df7" rel="nofollow">The Tavern</a> forums and the author keeps a <a href="http://wordplay.ukrpgblogs.net/" rel="nofollow">development blog</a>.<br/><br/>It is the third game of this kind which to catch my attention this year :-P, the other two being the new Heroquest revised rules and Other Worlds, which also might fit the bill for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143094/#Comment_143094" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T12:11:34+00:00" title="May  8, 2008 12:11PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played Wordplay.

The only "work" you have to put into it is creating the content of the homeland keywords and such... but I'd posit that doing so is loads of fun. Leastways it always has been for me.

I did a Star Wars one shot and have an ongoing Exalted game. Of course, a lot of my development was helped out by Mike Holmes' ample resources of advice in various HQ discussions, and a lot of re-reading fiddly parts of the game (especially the magic system) before I got comfortable with it.  The book is deceptively tied to the setting.  All the core rules are completely setting independant. But all the keywords (the foundation of a character) and the way magic is learned and developed in play, are tied to the system.  But think of them as extended examples (like "You can do magic like this, this, or this or make up your own system").<br/><br/>Although at this point, I'd suggest waiting for Other Worlds (a new system inspired a lot by Mike Holmes' style of HQ, which makes sense since he's one of the designers) and the new generic HeroQuest redesigned by Robin Laws (the original designer of HQ) making it more user friendly and flexible, and working out some of the kinks and questionable rules.<br/><br/>But BiggerBoat, Spirit of the Century (Fate 3) sounds like it does what you wanted Fate 2 to do, and matches your examples, mostly.  There's also Dogs in the Vineyard, which sounds a lot like your example exchange, since you bring in dice based on traits you bring in (with some base stats depending on if you start with a gunfight or arguing or whatever, and when you switch modes in the conflict). However, that's pretty tied into the theme of the setting - it doesn't have to be western, but it works best if you are figures of authority laying down judgement in an attempt to solve problems. And Poison'd which is even closer especially to the final exchange, but is even more tied to its pirate setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BiggerBoat" title="BiggerBoat"><img alt="BiggerBoat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BiggerBoat">BiggerBoat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143113/#Comment_143113" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T13:01:28+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  1:01PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2008 1:02PM by BiggerBoat.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>Why did you stop at Fate 2.0?

Perhaps I'll write the author and see if he's interested in any additional playtesters.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>If you can wait only a leeetle bit longer, there will be Other Worlds. Which might accomplish what you need quite admirably.<br/><br/>That said, the only "difficulty" in using HQ for your needs is that you have to just have the right perspective when looking at what the rulebook provides. That is, just don't read all of it. Try starting with this:<a href="http://www.glorantha.com/support/GameAids.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.glorantha.com/support/GameAids.pdf</a><br/></blockquote>\nThanks for the link to the summary. I had missed that. I'll give it a look.<br/><br/>I'll search around and see what I can learn about "Other Worlds" as well. Thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143125/#Comment_143125" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T14:27:13+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  2:27PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2008 2:29PM by renatoram.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some examples of the non-obvious implications of the Fate v3 rules, particularly in combat:<br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=315071" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=315071</a><br/><br/>In particular read 'sabbatregent' posts about his Lord of the Rings game and Fred's about his Dictionary of Mu Fate game.<br/><br/>What's even more interesting is that SotC rules allow you to do the very same cool stuff in whatever scenario of conflict (not just phisical violent combat): Fate v3 characters can be fantastically interesting and powerful when using knowledge and/or social skills (...even in phisical combats).<br/><br/>I don't remember it all of it is described there, but the interactions of Aspect invocations, tagging, declarations, compels, zones and borders makes for a very "variated" system, but all based on the same 1 or 2 mechanics. If you register on the FateRPG yahoo group you can find some good rules summary that take exactly one page and detail pretty much all the interactions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/First%20Age" title="First Age"><img alt="First Age" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/First%20Age">First Age</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143134/#Comment_143134" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T15:20:52+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  3:20PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2008 3:22PM by First Age.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BiggerBoat wrote:<br/><br/><i>"That looks interesting, thanks.

It plays very similarly to HeroQuest, but uses '<i>Building your hand of dice</i>' - a dice building mechanic and a simple D6 dice pool success counting system for in game 'Challenges'.<br/><br/>The game text is to be released in October as a PDF under the most generous, shareable, give away licence known to man. A POD book and PDF with art and five additional Themes will appear for real money in Spring 09. From June to September there will be monthly drops of the text for people who wish to take a look and play with it. I'll be sure to send you the June release of the text direct to your mailbox. If anyone else is interested then just let me know.<br/><br/>I could really do with sexing up the website, as I have a great artist working on the book, and some wonderful people writing the Themes. I'll get on that, as I want things to be ready for the October (<a href="http://rpgfurnace.com" rel="nofollow">Furnace</a>) release of the PDF.<br/><br/>Best                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143136/#Comment_143136" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T15:24:42+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  3:24PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Greg Stolze's <i>Reign</i> may hit what you want too - it is built on its own setting, but it's not strongly tied to it (you might need to rework some of the magic schools and so forth).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143147/#Comment_143147" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T16:01:00+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  4:01PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your actual play writeup reminds me of a session of Evolved Grottoes and Gorgons, a fantasy game I've been running with the Disciple 12 system (a wonky d12-based dice pool system).<br/><br/>Here's the Disciple 12 System Technique Document:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.dread-rpg.com/DreadSTD.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dread-rpg.com/DreadSTD.pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143234/#Comment_143234" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T01:19:01+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  1:19AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://open.crngames.com/src/donjon.html" rel="nofollow">Donjon</a> does a lot of what you're looking for, is super cool, and is also free!
