If you have, we\u2019d like to hear about your experiences.<br/><br/>To use the jargon of our (non)profession, we\u2019re looking for actual play reports.<br/><br/>But we\u2019re not looking for transcripts of play or attempts to objectively describe how the mechanics functioned in your group.<br/><br/>No, we\u2019re looking for expressionistic actual play reports. We want to know how it felt to play the game. We want to know what you were imagining as you played, how you saw the reality that you created through play. We want to know if you were offended, or amused, or bored. And we don\u2019t care whether you loved the game, or hated it.<br/><br/>And we want to share your experiences on our site.<br/><br/>So record a video, or an audio clip. Or write something, quickly, on whatever you have at hand. Write it on a receipt from the liquor store, or your welfare check, or a handkerchief stained with tuberculous blood. Write it narrative style, or stream of consciousness, or as an angry vulgarity filled rant.<br/><br/>And then send it to us. Send it to us, and we will post it, regardless of whether it reflects positively or negatively on us. Also, we\u2019ll put a link to your blog or gaming site or whatever else you\u2019d like in the post. (But, please, play the game first. We are looking for responses to actual play, not reviews of the text.)<br/><br/>Oh, and since I know we have a (small) international audience: feel free to use your native language. If Rudy and I can\u2019t read Italian or Polish or Lojban, that\u2019s our problem, not yours.<br/></blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.miserytourism.com/want-to-talk-about-it/" rel="nofollow">miserytourism.com/want-to-talk-about-it/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
