                    So I've been talking about love and sex and all that jazz in RPGs for a bit now, and then there was the thread about how playing with your friends or playing with people you game with effects what we do, and then the gaming census thread, and so now I'm wondering...<br/><br/>Have any of you ever had members of a gaming group hook up or break up during a game? Over the course of all the games a set group played? <br/><br/>If so, did it affect the game in any way? <br/><br/>Also, for those of you that are married or in long term, how has it affected your gaming? Do you game more now? Less? Do you play one-on-one games with your partner? Why or why not? <br/><br/>Do you ever find it hard to maintain "balance" between your SO and the rest of the group? Does your group ever complain about it (either with you or others)? <br/><br/>Once I start getting some answers, I'll start focusing in on thins. For now I mostly want general thoughts and anecdotes about the subject, to see what sorts of experiences folks have had.                </div>

                            Okay, to answer my own questions in a general way: <br/><br/>I started playing with my current extended group about 5 years ago, just as I was in the process of moving to Toronto. My context of meeting them was always as "Mo's friends" who gradually became my friends. Gaming started up more or less in tandem with the closeness of the relationships -- as I got closer we'd start to game, and as we gamed we'd get closer. So the groups were always used to me and Mo in the game together. <br/><br/>Of the rest of the group we always had coupled pairs as a big part of the group. The four other people we play with the most often were dating when I met them, and all are married now. Another player was single, hooked up with a girl, and got married a few years after that. For the folks who were already in relationships nothing much changed, as all members were gamers. The guy that got married, however, started having trouble juggling his gaming and his other personal time, as his wife often objected to the going off for 16 hours a weekend to do something without her just after they were married. Now days we hang out with him and the wife (both close friends) and play boardgames constantly, but we haven't played a game longer than a oneshot in months, and I don't know when we'll do so again. That relationship change certainly killed that part of the previous dynamic. <br/><br/>Between the couples in our games its a pretty common problem for whoever is GM to be harder on their partner than they are on anyone else. I know I've done this as recently as Bitches in the Vineyard, where I was much harder on Mo than the others (shamefully so, sometimes). Other GMs in the group (mostly the boys, GMing for their wives, who tend to be impassioned and character socket players, as opposed to the boys story and setting sockets) have either admitted to the same problem, or have had it admitted for them by the group because its so blatantly obvious. Since we started doing more formal social contracts we've been able to nip this one a little bit, because there just tends to be less unspoken subtext. <br/><br/>Mo and I do play one on one games together, pretty regularly. The rest of our group, to my knowledge, doesn't. Several of the other couples have tried, but stopped because it either felt silly or because it didn't meet one of their payouts -- or because they found they just couldn't game together without other people to mitigate them. This is despite the fact that we've occasionally had one-on-one sessions across couples (me GMing for one other player, most of the time) without the oddity. I have to wonder, however, if some of that has to do with my "Most Honored and Magical GM" status. (Silly status.) <br/><br/>Now, all of that is these days. Before 5 years ago, in University and online gaming, the situation was different. Much different. But I'm going to hold that for a post tomorrow, I think.                        </div>

Dave (my partner) and I have been together for nearly seven years, and I just started gaming less than a year ago.  At first, to be honest, I think it took a little adjustment on Dave's part -- for a while I was having marathon gaming sessions that went into the wee hours of the morning once or twice a week, and it occasionally seemed to throw him off a bit.  I'm used to him running off to do similar nerdly activities, though, so we pretty quickly ironed out the few issues that cropped up.  Dave now joins in games on a fairly regular basis; he's part of my monthly gaming group, and he also played in my Mountain Witch game that I GMed in December/January.<br/><br/>I have occasionally had some worries that he was gaming simply to please me, but he very much enjoys himself, for all he professes not to enjoy the mechanics of the games all that much (he's apparently even more of a hippie gamer than I am...).  When I GMed The Mountain Witch, I was probably more concerned about whether he was "getting it" and having fun than I was concerned about the other players, because they were all much more seasoned gamers.  I didn't worry too much about being perceived as favoring him or being too hard on him, since it's such a player driven game anyway.<br/><br/>On another note, I have to admit that I've sometimes worried a little bit about being a woman gaming with mostly men.  I've always had a lot of guy friends, and thus to me in most respects it's not a big deal, but I'm now at a point in my life when a lot of my guy friends are in long-term relationships or are getting married, and it's sometimes made me scrutinize my interactions with them out of worry that I might inadvertantly provoke jealousy.  I tend to pay a bit more attention to this than usual in roleplaying contexts, because of the potential for emotional stuff bleeding over a bit.  I don't think it's entirely coincidental that one of my friends and I became much closer when our characters became closer, so it's probably not surprising that when our characters started flirting we both kind of pulled back a bit and made sure that everyone (including our respective SO's) was ok with it.  He and I had no intention of becoming romantically involved in real life, but we sort of realized that saying "oh, it's just a game" didn't remove all of the potential complications.                        </div>

                            Kirsten, <br/><br/>Fascinating. So, I'm taking it he wasn't into gaming when you got into it. Had he ever gamed before? What was the first time you gamed together like? <br/><br/>Everyone else, <br/><br/>That's the other thing I didn't get towards -- does the sexual/romantic relationship between characters in game ever bleed over to the players? Do people <i>worry</i> that it will? <br/><br/><br/>For my part, I know there is bleed over when Mo and I play one on one games -- especially as she's an impassioned player and its just the two of us. Ironically it only happens in some games, but the characters that are prone to it seem especially prone to it. <br/><br/>Outside of just us, it's been a long time since I've had bleedover in games, or even had anyone be worried about bleedover in games. I think the first time I GMed for some of the current group of players they were a little surprised by the fact that gaming with me was sexy and/or romantic. Many of them were used to that in LARP, but not in tabletop, and really didn't think that dorky looking and geeky talking me could play NPCs that were the sex -- so the fact that I could, and did, caused some initial weirdness. We never did anything in particular to get past it either, it just went away in time. Which probably has to do with the phase in our lives we were in, all being committed and all (mostly) of the committed parties being in the game.                        </div>

                            Brand, I have a good deal of experience with these issues, but I think it's probably not a good idea for me to say much about most of it out of respect for the people involved. Suffice it to say that when you're GMing both your girlfriends and another person you enjoy teasing in the same group, it can be very difficult to figure out what's a gaming issue and what's an interpersonal issue.<br/><br/>More currently, I'm dealing with a bit of a dilemma on this front that ties into the time bind I talked about in the other thread. Kathy (my partner) and I really like to play in the same games. It's much, much more difficult for us to find opportunities to do this than it is for us to game separately. However, we've found that gaming separately in practice means that at any given time, one of us is probably in a game and the other isn't. This creates jealousy. Plus, valuable free time is spent away from family.                        </div>

A long while ago, one of the guys we game with was a player in a game with a woman who was having some trouble in her marriage. Partially due to that (I think partially out of spite, and partially to just to find fun time outside the stress of her relationship) she ran the game in marathon sessions long into the night. There was another player in the game and nothing even remotely untoward ever happened, but the game became one of the biggest weapons in the divorce that ensued. Infidelity was accused, terrible things were said, and my friend's wife even had to come to his defense. <br/><br/>Needless to say, it had huge impacts on his willingness to game with her, and with her ex husband. I know that even years later the ripples of the outburst were still felt in the local LARP.                        </div>

                            Mark, <br/><br/>Yea, Mo had an Exalted game that had started before I moved to Toronto that she used to play without me. Twice a month, every month, for four years. I didn't have a huge amount of jealousy, even though I didn't usually game in the time she was gone, but there was an oddity to the situation. Several times other people in the group even commented about it, as they were all the core group, but we just couldn't fit me into the game as it already had too many players. <br/><br/>I honestly think that there was always more fear about me being jealous than there was actual jealousy, which gets into the real problem of relationships around game: it isn't often even about what people actually feel so much as it is about what people fear other people might be feeling or people think they should be feeling but aren't.

I think he'd done a little D&amp;D in highschool, and he's always hung around people who gamed, so he can make alignment jokes with the best of them, but he's never gamed consistently.  He and I actually recently had a very funny interaction -- I'm gearing up for a <i>Dark Ages Vampire</i> game that my friend Tim is GMing, and Dave kept asking me if I was playing a Cappadocian.  I was all like, "Aw, you've been paying attention!" and he was like, "Well, actually, I just remember the guys in college talking about their Vampire characters, and the only clan name I remembered was Cappadocian."<br/><br/>The first time we gamed together was with someone else GMing.  It was really kind of... fascinating, because I'm not used to seeing him playact or do more creative things.  I mean, he's a creative person, but when he did theater he was a tech guy, never an actor.  He builds things.  So even now it's a source of fascination for me to watch him inhabit a character, and he consistently surprises me.   It's been a cool thing for me.                        </div>

Oh yeah, that is SO true.  I mean, almost all of my worries about potentially provoking jealousy have (at least as far as I KNOW) been unfounded.  Of course, my one or two miscalculations have had a long shelf life. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            I've seen it happen quite a bit with most pairs of significant others in my different groups. Although my S.O. and I are definitely among the worst! We also really get into character (which isn't always healthy in certain situations) and our games tend to be really, really vicious (we do play plenty of Burning Wheel, Dogs, and Mountain Witch after all!!!). <br/><br/>You bring up an amazing point which I didn't even consider. This tension among significant others never happens between pairs making up a player and a GM, only between players and players. Almost all of us take turns GMing so there have been making games where I have observed this. If the GM or player is being a bastard but their significant other is playing a different role, tension almost never rises up! Weird. I don't know why. Pretty interesting!                        </div>

                            I've witnessed this (SO as GM treating romantic relationship player differently) happen all the time in high school and college. I've mostly seen it happen when one of the people in the equation was only playing because their SO was. Which in itself can be a recipe for disaster! I've also seen this happen a lot with shitty GMs. Who were often shitty because of their inability to deal with social situations (listen, be honest, adapt, manage people, lead). I've also seen this be more of a problem with relationships that were on shaky ground, temporary, or in its early stages. I've seen most of these issues diminished with married couples. The more socially awkward someone is, the worse this problem seems to be. I've seen one guy spend 75% of the game only GM for his SO and ignore everyone else. We don't let him GM anymore!!!                        </div>

                            I married who I did in part because my partner is a brilliant gamer <em>with as much interest in gaming</em> as I have.  (The former is the icing, the latter is the essential cake.)  From experience, I would not at this point even <span style="text-decoration: underline;">consider</span> dating a non-gamer.  My language and free time is too wrapped up in the hobby to be an enjoyable partner to anyone who was not involved in the scene.  (I've tried the "converting" once or twice and got a little tired of being called a "dork" no matter how much endearment was intended.)   Similarly, I would not consider dating someone who wasn't familiar with computers, who didn't consider television optional, or wasn't an honest polyamorous type, but that's probably too much information. [laughing]<br/><br/>I am tougher GMing my husband because I expect more out of him.  I also fret a lot more because I am thinking the whole time, "He's seen through my whole idea!  I'm so transparent to him, he'll figure out all the puzzles!  He won't appreciate it because it'll be so abecedarian to him." And I can't keep secrets from him because, "He's the only one who will appreciate this little throwaway line I added into this completely optional flavour text, so I might as well tell him now."   He says he's the same way about me.<br/><br/>I am willing to game without my husband, but I think I enjoy the experience more with him.  I do one-on-one games with him, and games with my family, and I think there's a lot of "shorthand" which means we have better gaming because we don't have to do so much defining, and beat the learning curve.  I can say something like, "She's got Rran's null," and my husband knows exactly to what I'm referring.   <br/><br/>I will let him bend rules sometimes, but I like to think I would do the same for anyone who asked and had the same convincing reasoning.  He has more access to me outside the game, so he does have an advantage there, but it's not like I won't talk about my games ad nauseum.  (You can't do it all the time, but you can talk about it all the time.)  No one has complained in my hearing about me being unfair (either positive or negative) to him, but my (now ex-)girlfriend did once ask me to make the button, "It's good being the GM's girlfriend," because I _did_ do some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_service" rel="nofollow">fan service</a> for her in a game once.   <br/><br/>With that in mind, I ruined one gaming group by sleeping with the GM. [sighs]  Bad choice on my part; the game was much better than the sex, and the campaign didn't hold together after that.   I often crush hard on my gaming friends because of the implied intimacy of the gaming gestalt. As the game goes along I am able to distinguish between that and the trust metric, but it takes a little time once the gestalt has been established.                        </div>

                            My main gaming group is comprised of two couples and three single gentlemen. I'm in one of those couples. The group is fairly mismatched as friends/acquaintances, but even moreso as players. The two people who are usually butting heads are the other couple. As players, they're almost the complete opposite. It can be aggravating. If they weren't a couple, it wouldn't surprise me if one of them would've stopped playing by now. My wife and I don't really treat each other in any special way as players. Neither of us has ever GMed though.<br/><br/>I was in a couple one shots with another group whose GM bent over backwards to please his largely disinterested wife. He made her an overpowered character and deferred to her wishes. It was pretty irritating and pathetic.                        </div>

                            See, I'm with Meera.  One of the large aspects of my marriage is our shared interest in gaming.  I simply <em>do not understand</em> how you people can date and/or marry non-gamers.  You know how the joke is supposed to be how gamers will make in-jokes about gaming?  Yeah, my wife and I just make references and don't even notice that we're doing it anymore.  I wouldn't be able to communicate with a non-gamer spouse.<br/><br/>That said, when we both play and somebody else GMs, we are always, without fail, antagonistic to each other.  We have <em>tried</em> to do the cutesy romantic characters thing, and it just so does not work.  This is a player-agenda thing; when gaming, I want to <em>push</em>, and she wants to <em>explore</em>, which means that most of the time I'm looking to subvert the content that she wants to get comfortable in.  She wants to play a Paladin of the Holy Order of Goodness, and she wants to really inhabit the Goodness and get to <em>be</em> a Paladin of Goodness.  Meanwhile, I'm skulking about the back-end of the Temple of Goodness looking for the dirty secrets of the priests and the economic support structure that keeps the church afloat.  Two great tastes that do not go great together.<br/><br/>I actually think we're relatively fair-minded when we GM for each other.  If anything, I neglect her in favor of the other players because I trust her to get where I'm going with less prompting (it also helps that she has more access to me and we chat about the game throughout the rest of the week).  I do, however, know when she's ready to take the spotlight, and so I give it to her on cue better than I'm able to with the other players -- I just don't read them as well as I do my wife.<br/><br/>I have had gaming groups dissolve because of jealous SOs, but... that was in the bad dysfunctional gaming days, and in the specific instance I'm thinking of, it wouldn't have mattered if we were playing Parcheesi.  The girl in question just wanted her boy's undivided attention 24/7.  They got married; we never heard from them again.                        </div>

                            Joshua and Meera,<br/><br/>Well, my wife plays games from time to time but she definitely isn't a "gamer" per se.  Also, as I've gotten older gaming has become less this huge, central portion of my life and more just one of many things that I do.  Family is central to my life.  Church is central to my life.  Gaming, reading, playing the trumpet, and other things are just stuff I like to do with any free time I have.  I happen to like gaming more than most of the other stuff.  Anyway, that's how I could date and marry someone who doesn't share an interest in gaming with me.  After all, she loves dancing and well... I'm only interested as far as it leads to getting laid, to tell the truth.<br/><br/>I've run into people playing favorites with SO's during games but that generally isn't a huge issue.  What I've run into more is players making in-game romances and relationships mirror the real world relationships.  While this isn't a huge problem it can be kind of irritating.  It's irritating because the real world relationships preclude certain in-game relationships ever even enjoying the possibility of happening.  As long as we're playing D&amp;D and such... not a big deal.  Those relationships don't really keep me from killing monsters and getting treasure.  However, if we are playing DitV or TSoY or BW, then having in-game relationships truncated can be a bummer.                        </div>

                            Yes.  Hook ups and break ups often affect the game.  They often add  more drama to the group, result in losing one or more players, and sometimes can become annoying as one person will start parroting another's ideas even when they disagree just for the sake of supporting their current paramour.<br/><br/>That said, I *love* playing with folk in stable relationships when they maintain their own independent ideas.  Not only do they tend to be on consistently on time and generally more stable than other players, but they tend to be more comfortable with exploring sexuality and inter-character relationships in game.  That's fun stuff.                        </div>

                            I've only ever dated gamers (and very few at that).  My husband and I met at the gaming table, 13 years ago.  Our getting romantically involved definitely changed the dynamic at the gaming table, but since at the time he was in the process of moving out of the area, the impact was short-lived.  We simply re-formed other groups when I joined him in his new town a few months later.  Since then, we have often found our gaming groups including one or more other couples, and I suspect that gaming couples tend to unconsciously congregate.  We also have a higher than average proportion of female gamers, and it's not rare that my husband in the only man at the table or at least in the minority.  We now game exclusively with friends for our long-running campaigns and have many non-gaming activities together, though we also join the weekly one-shot games at the local gaming club.<br/><br/>We are very involved in local gaming activities, club events, game day events, conventions, etc.  Both of us have standing permission to game separately but we hardly ever do except at conventions, and even that very rarely, because it's not as much fun without each other.  We make a fearsome team!  ^_^  It's particularly fun to get a chance to both be players together because so often one of us is the GM.<br/><br/>We have been lucky -- we have not had gaming couple breakups at the table since we've been together, although we have both separately been in groups where this happened.  We have lost players due to their relationships with non-gamers, but if you don't pressure them they generally come back after a while.  We have one such case in my campaign now, we've gamed with him for eight years but there was an interruption of a few years when he first got married.  <br/><br/>As for GMs being tougher on their SO than on anyone else, that was initially very true with us.  Nowadays there is still this tendency, but we discuss it openly and give each other feedback to avoid overdoing it.  On the other hand, we have occasionally gamed with couples with the opposite problem.  One in particular was notorious for the GM's wife (let's call her Martie) getting <b>all</b> the good stuff.  We gamed with them for over four years because Martie was in fact a charming person, but we and every other player in the group privately rolled our eyes and referred to the games as "The Martie and Friends Show."  This in fact drove my husband and I to be even tougher on each other for a while.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anemone</cite>This in fact drove my husband and I to be even tougher on each other for a while.</blockquote>
I suspect this is in part what fuels the tendency for GMs to be harder on players who they're romantically involved with -- no one wants to be seen as favoring their partner, and so they tend to come down harder to compensate.  I get a sense, too, that sometimes greater intimacy and knowledge of a person means that you have a better sense of what they can or can't take, so it's easier to come down hard without worrying that you're pushing beyond the players' limits.<br/><br/>I think our Mountain Witch game ended up being fairly balanced, but I know that during our second session, I put more pressure on Dave than I did on some of the other characters, because he hadn't seemed as involved during the first session, and I wanted to force (I mean, encourage...) him to interact more with the other players.  I did the same thing for a couple of the other players, though; mostly, I wanted to make sure that with such a big group (six players) everyone had enough spotlight time.  But I know that I was in some ways more highly attuned to Dave, because it was easier for me to intuitively tell how engaged he was.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.W.Richeson</cite>That said, I *love* playing with folk in stable relationships when they maintain their own independent ideas.  Not only do they tend to be on consistently on time and generally more stable than other players, but they tend to be more comfortable with exploring sexuality and inter-character relationships in game.  That's fun stuff.</blockquote>
I have very much found this to be the case. However, I was talking with some others about issues like this elsenet recently, and they've said they found the opposite. In their wild and swinging college days they had lots of sex and romance in game, but now that they play with couples as a couple they have much, much less. <br/><br/>So I guess it really has more to do with the kind of couple you're talking about than their couple status.                        </div>

                            The three different longer-term groups I had in table top gaming were all exclusively male and never contained more than one homosexual or bisexual member, so there were no hookups or breakups inside of the groups.  The status of players with people outside the game did influence their behavior, but I guess that's another topic.<br/><br/>Online, of course, it's a whole different game (hah).  People hook up all the time, and break up as well.  Characters are often much more closely tied to the players than in table top groups.  I know several players who almost exclusively play with other people that they have a mutual attraction with.  Games fall apart pretty quickly when the OOC "relationships" break up.<br/><br/>I do play with my wife, quite frequently.  We play over chat because that's what she likes best.  Chat play is also closer to collaborative writing than table top play, and since we're both writers, we enjoy that aspect of it.  We play one-on-one a lot, but we also play group games with others.  The one-on-one games allow us to focus on each other (what with the medium being slow and all), we don't have to hold anything back (we're on the same page with Lines+Veils, and they're pretty far out), and we tend to like the same sort of dramatic setups that thrive on the tension between the characters.<br/><br/>When we play in a group, the only thing that's a bit "out of balance" is that our characters, unless we make them absolutely incompatible or non-sexual, will invariably be attracted to one another, and if left to their own devices, usually end up with very strong feelings for each other that no other player's character could ever compete with.  I've found that it's really fruitless to try and prevent that, and instead we're now using this force of nature as dramatic fuel by making sure we set up our characters in ways that they can't ever happily be together.                        </div>
