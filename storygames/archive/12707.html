If I were Vincent Baker, or Luke Crane, I'd be printing super-deluxe $100 signed and numbered editions of my games for the really hardcore fans. Make that content available before the broad release. Sell playtest positions and chances to game with you at Cons for real, serious money. I bet Luke could easily get $100 a head for a 4-6 hour Burning Wheel scenario he prepped exclusively for that event.<br><br>If your work can be stolen, sell the one thing that can't be duplicated: YOU. I wasn't being hyperbolic when I invoked Neil Gaiman in the other thread. I really think he's right about the life of creatives coming full circle from mass distribution back around to personal contact; using the work to leverage peoples' desire to meet you, and not just to consume the work. The Penny Arcade guys have been masters of this as well, along with a few smart and savvy game creators: Monte Cooke, Margaret Weiss &amp; Tracy Hickman, etc.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285677/#Comment_285677" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T22:56:31+00:00" title="August 11, 2010 10:56PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2010 10:57PM by PeterBB.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sell awesome tangible goods. This can be books (I would love to own a copy of Mouse Guard, even though I've never actually played the game), but it doesn't have to be. Ganakagok's tarot deck strikes me as a great example of this. Even just ordinary merch like t-shirts or dice bags would probably work; I would totally buy an Apocalypse World t-shirt. (One way to make something awesome is to make it exclusive. Jim's autographed books definitely fit this model.)<br/><br/>Use Kickstarter or similar. <br/><br/>Sell some other sort of exclusivity. This could be so many things. The Early Dark people have lots of great ideas, check out the packages for the various donation levels: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/anthroposgames/early-dark-tabletop-role-playing-game?pos=1&amp;ref=search" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter Page</a><br/><br/>Switch to some sort of subscription model. If I had written Fiasco, I would probably have reversed the format they currently use. They sell the main rules and give monthly playsets out for free. Why not do it the other way around? Alternatively, Halfjack over at Blue Collar Space has been talking about a different sort of subscription model <a href="http://www.vsca.ca/halfjack/?p=633" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.vsca.ca/halfjack/?p=645" rel="nofollow">here</a>. (If you think ongoing subscriptions are no good, you can always do the Guild Wars thing and sell a one-time package that gets a subscription forever/for a certain amount of time)<br/><br/>Use a shareware model. Offer the PDF for free, and have the first page be a request that the reader buy a hardcopy or send you some cash if they start playing regularly. (Some games, like Hell 4 Leather and Society of Dreamers, do this implicitly. A heck of a lot more do it accidentally, due to filesharing. Why not make it explicit?)<br/><br/>I'm sure I'm missing a lot of ideas, but those seem like promising first starts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285678/#Comment_285678" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T23:36:55+00:00" title="August 11, 2010 11:36PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another angle is institutionalized: set up artist vacancies in state and private foundations with wages and normal benefits, paid for by the usual public cultural funding. Or have those institutions, by the way of expert boards, evaluate individual artists and contract them for individual pieces of work. Collect money for this the same way it's collected now, only more of it. For example, because personal copying of culture products is legal in Finland, we already pay an extra tax on any digital storage mediums that can be used to store these copies, something like 1-5 percent of the price of the MP3 player or blank CD or whatever. Hike that cost up while you legalize piracy, then use the money to collectively support the creative scene. It's a socialist solution with socialist weaknesses, but it'll do its bit.<br/><br/>I should note that some arts already work like the above, at least here in Finland. Ballet comes to mind: if you want to be a ballet dancer in Finland and get paid for it, it's essentially the national opera or bust for you. The opera is heavily supported with public money, so the artist in this case has to pretty much get accepted by a public institution to become an official, state-sanctioned ballet dancer if they want money for what they do. The system certainly draws its critics, but it's not an obvious catastrophe from day one or anything like that. Notably the ballet dancers do not seem to think that they're entitled to any more wide-spread financial opportunities from society.<br/><br/>In fact, now that I think of it, I'll be properly institutionalized (ha) myself for the coming months as I work with an arts grant in place. It's not my full-time state, but the better sort of society artist can even now get a near-total coverage of his work by applying for long-term working grants, becoming fully supported by the public. The institutions already exist to pick up the slack, or part of it, when the publishing industry turns belly up. I won't for a moment believe that the society will want to maintain the same overall level of output caused by the lucrativeness of the culture industry today, but it'll pay for something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285699/#Comment_285699" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T06:26:15+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  6:26AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2010 6:26AM by mease19.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that I love about indie games is that you're consuming one person's expert vision when you consume their product.  With other games, you're getting a product produced by a committee.  I like the idea that I could meet or email the designer.  As stated above, that's got to be the draw.  Give the .pdf's away for free.  Want a hard-copy? - buy the book.  Really like the .pdf? - pay $5 more to get an autographed/personalized copy.  The key, make it easy.  I almost never have the oportunity to go to conventions, but I still love having autographed copies of my favorite games, keep a couple extra around and/or sign a couple extra to leave at your warehouse.  Heck, one option is to just wait a couple years and do a small "anniversary" edition but do it with flare - shirts, signed/numbered copies - create your own revival (and get cool product out there for the people that missed the original release).<br/><br/>Also, as stated above, a blending with board games produces an conceptual written product and a physical product.  Include cards (e.g. freemarket) or dice (e.g. Fudge dice) into your game.  Create mechanically necessary maps (e.g. <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/412954/android" rel="nofollow">Android</a> uses arcs and a map to determine the time frame for moving between locations, this could work well in a defined planetary system) or tiles.  <br/><br/>You can also find ways to help player's pimp their games by offering short runs of custom items that add to the game play.  I'd love d6's with the symbol from Dogs in the Vineyard just like the Call of Cthulhu players' elder sign dice.  A game like Diaspora could have custom fate chips that were actually blank poker chips printed to look like planets.  Its the little things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285707/#Comment_285707" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T06:52:25+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  6:52AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To compile a list of approaches, here's what we have so far:\n<ul>\n<li>Sell spin-off product that can't be digitalized</li>\n<li>Inspire small donations by on-going production and subtle pressure, like webcomics do</li>\n<li>Sell prestige associated with your fame and respect</li>\n<li>Get payments in advance and publish into digital distribution</li>\n<li>Sell subscriptions that compete with free distribution with the convenience of constant updates all in one place</li>\n<li>Get a patron, public or private, distributed or unitary</li>\n</ul>\nIs that all we got?

Not perhaps Metallica, but I'm sort of imagining an author with snotty fans who pay out because they're better than those free-riding pirate scum and want to prove it; perhaps such an author could cultivate this attitude in his audience by subtly enforcing this sort of tendency until it blossoms into a general mind-set. Moral pressure as a market strategy, in other words. I'd say that this is a very significant factor in most culture markets as they try to convince people to not go pirate today, in fact, but I don't know how it'll fare in the future; I could imagine how it would still remain viable even after free distribution was legalized, especially if you worked to have the attitude pertain only to you and your work: sure it's OK to take stuff for free in general, but <em>this</em> author is relying on you to pay him, so don't be an asshole.

One market example is WorldWorksGames.  When they first started releasing sets, you found torrents of them everywhere.  They went on their forums and explained how their business worked and that if people were spending their cash on a product and then sharing it with others, there would be fewer products to buy.  I'm sure if you look hard enough you can find their newer stuff, but last I looked I couldn't.  So, I think it can work to appeal to your paying customer's pride to keep the product from being shared.<br/><br/>Another thought is to personalize each copy somehow.

They seem to have been through the control-everything phase that print publishers are going through now.<br/><br/>So a couple of examples of things I've done and why I did them.<br/><br/>I wound up buying PDF copies of Polaris and In A Wicked Age after buying the print copies separately.  I am pretty sure I could have found them on file sharing networks somewhere, but purely on a selfish, practical level, buying them meant I clicked here, typed a few things there, and they were on the way.  The fact that the money went to designers I want to see more work from, well, that's pretty selfish too, when you think about it.<br/><br/>For a Ribbon Drive playlist, I wanted an English-language version of Jacques Brel's "Amsterdam."  I certainly have access to file-sharing networks, but I started with iTunes.  Bang, less than 2 minutes later, I'm listening to a sample of David Bowie's cover and Ute Lemper's cover.  99 cents for each of them.  This is why I use iTunes instead of file sharing networks. <br/><br/>Back in 2002 or so when the Call of Cthulhu 20th Anniversary Edition came out, I already owned two copies of the rules.  But I gladly shelled out extra for the 20th Anniversary Edition.  Likewise with the Deluxe Edition of GURPS 4th - I paid $125 for those books, when I was volunteering as a MIB and could have gotten the standard edition those books for free for running two GURPS demo sessions at conventions.

Hasn't it always been the goal of many people doing art to be able to make a living off that art? Being "indie" has never been about NOT making a living off of art. It's about making art outside of established systems and industries, and <i>possibly </i>making money up to and including a living.<br/><br/>Myself, If I never had to go back to work again and could feed and shelter myself and my family based only on doing ART, games or otherwise, I'd say yes in a heartbeat and never look back.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>it seems like the main thing ages back at TF was exploring how to make and distribute games and possibly make a little side hobby money on them, not support the designer and their family on the income.<br/></blockquote>\nMy understanding is that it was the Forge's <i>assessment</i> that very, very few people were able to make a living in the RPG scene (and even at that, overall companies tend to lose money and go out of business quite a lot). All the efforts of the Forge in promoting indie publishing has been toward making publishing for yourself <i>more viable</i>. That includes, but is not limited to, making money from it.<br/><br/>Now, very few indie publishers are making a living from their games--perhaps not ANY; I'm not sure on that score. Vincent Baker of all people says his games are a very lucrative side business, but not his living. Maybe Luke Crane and the Evil Hat guys are making a living? I dunno.<br/><br/>But I'll tell you what, *I* would sure as hell LIKE to.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Without selling the hell out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Myself, I'm inclined to pursue that goal by raising the Personal Connection bar as high as I possibly can, through methods already mentioned here and any others I can think of. My version of un-digitizable product is experimenting with handmade book designs that speak of craft and artistry which have no electronic substitute. My version of leveraging fame and prestige is playing in person with as many people as possible. I like to tell people that a purchase of my booklet comes with a free game with me, at their earliest convenience.<br/><br/>This all arises from my personal feelings ABOUT the game, and about games in general. When I released my ashcan of the Dreaming Crucible, I found that I was far more interested in A) playing with people, or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> HEARING about play after the fact, than I was in selling the book and never hearing a peep about it again. I realized that the play of the game was the real thing, and the book just a step toward that. In one sense, if I could, I would never sell a physical book, and pass the game on purely through play. I would spread an <i>experience</i>.<br/><br/>However, I can't do that because A) I don't know how to leverage that into feeding my family, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> I don't know how to convey the game such that people could play it without me, absent a book.<br/><br/>Both of those things could possibly be achievable, however. I aim to keep pursuing both.<br/><br/>In the meantime, my focus is on making the book itself a thing of beauty in its own right, which justifies its existence even if you DO learn to play without referring to it. And that art object is immune to piracy short of knocking me down and grabbing it out of my hands. And the experience, the personal connection we can share through the game...well, you can't pirate that at all.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286200/#Comment_286200" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T14:08:14+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  2:08PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Offer services with your product.

This gives me an easy way to spend more money on a game I like: sure, I have a print copy on the way, but a screen-friendly landscape PDF is just the thing for dull moments at work.  <br/><br/>And on a completely unrelated note, I think the real problem is relative obscurity, and I wish I knew how to fix that cheaply.  I ran <i>Apocalypse World</i> for the current incarnation of my college gaming group yesterday (which failed to disintegrate, and in fact thrived, when I moved away 10 years ago).  Three of the players as much as said "This game is <i>awesome</i> and I've never heard of it!  Where did you find it?"  (Maybe that's three sales.  Here's hoping.)   Or <i>Ribbon Drive:</i> a coworker who can see my shared iTunes library asked me why there was a folder of playlists labeled Ribbon Drive, and I told him and explained, and he lit right up and said, "That sounds amazing - can I play next time?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/avram" title="avram"><img alt="avram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/n64KGLTEFAF9C.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/avram">avram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287057/#Comment_287057" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-17T23:25:59+00:00" title="August 17, 2010 11:25PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I've been thinking for a while now that there are two kinds of books that people are going to want to own for most of the coming century: (1) electronic documents, and (2) beautiful physical objects.

If the devices to read electronic documents get a lot better, and more importantly, a LOT cheaper, this could happen.  Maybe within the next ten years, even.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that'll be a good thing, mind you.  Yes, it'll save on paper and shipping costs and even on physical space, but building the ubiquitous, cheap, good e-readers and their batteries will have its own associated costs, too.  And it'll torpedo the used book market, which will be sad because used bookstores are often great locally-owned independent businesses, and those are important to a strong local economy.  Also, they'll need to come up with some solution for libraries, since I doubt the "please be honest and delete the book when you're past the due date" solution will still be acceptable to the publishers when people checking out an electronic document becomes more common than people checking out a printed text.  And right now I'd only lose all of my books in the event of a major disaster (fire, flood, tornado, etc.) or a really weird burglary; my library will get a lot more vulnerable when it's electronic.<br/><br/>So, lots of hurdles between today and the electronic-document future.  It'll be interesting to see how it all shakes out, that's for sure.  In the meantime, there are still plenty of reasons for companies to keep printing ordinary-quality books on paper, and plenty of people who'll buy them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287068/#Comment_287068" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T03:06:55+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  3:06AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2010 3:28AM by TylerT.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            avram<br/>\n<br/>\ndepends on what you mean by game designer, do you mean someone at a publisher who's job title is "game designer" or someone who self publishes and is in reality a "small business owner" (i am NOT making a value judgement with that distinction) because i'm sure that number is very different. also don't forget all the people who make the stuff that shows up in target and wal-mart table games are fairly wide spread when you look outside the hobby area.<br/>\n<br/>\nas for how many there are? who knows, especially with video games coming in the last 30 years. game design is a growing field.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aik" title="Aik"><img alt="Aik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aik">Aik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287081/#Comment_287081" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T04:31:21+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  4:31AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Go to The Pirate Bay/Demonoid and upload your game.
