I am stuck on one of the questions and was wondering what could be added (what am I missing) and a system for how it could be made important to the game.  Many of these questions will actually have a little more mechanical weight but I will have to approach those ideas later.<br/><br/>My goal is I'd like the missing one (#6 in this case) to be the most rocking question in the list.  Help me out with this please.<br/><br/>Here is the World Burning section of the rules thus far...\n<blockquote><br/>1. What is the primary mode of travel for most people? <br/>2. Is there a predominant race in the character's surroundings? <br/>3. What sort of religion do the people follow? <br/>4. What is the primary conflict for the PC's people? <br/>5. What is the most dangerous thing wizards have to deal with? <br/>6. No question here yet\u2026? <br/>7. What do people use to scribe? <br/>8. What are the people's favorite pastime? <br/>9. What is it that all wizards need to cast arcane spells? <br/>10. What alignment choices are unavailable to PCs<br/><br/>Then in the GM's own tome begin to write down each question.  Leave at least a page for each question since these topics will be expounded upon by the group later.<br/><br/>1. What is the primary mode of travel for most people?<br/><br/>By establishing the primary mode of travel the players define two things.  First the the group will know how long it will take to get from one point on the may to another (to be defined later).  Since time is one of the resources in the game that information is useful.  It will allow the players to seek alternate modes of travel in order to fulfill certain time sensitive considerations.  By understanding mode of travel it informs the group about the terrain and climate.  Using boats more than anything else says that the environment is probably islands or centered on a large body of water like the Mediterranean Sea.  Horses hints that the climate may be temperate to tropical as covered or protected travel is not as necessary.  None of these ideas are set in stone yet, however, the players can begin to discuss their implications to the world.  Consider that it is tempting to say teleportation is the way everyone gets around.  Although interesting consider that the PCs villains will be bound (or freed) by the same considerations.<br/><br/>2. Is there a predominant race in the character's surroundings?<br/><br/>This will help the group determine what race the main characters and NPCs will be.  Although players can choose races out of the normal keep in mind that it may incur some penalties to social interactions.  Again, depending on the player's preconceptions or ideas about certain races this decision may inspire the look and feel of their immediate starting point.<br/><br/>3. What sort of religion do the people follow?<br/><br/>Boy is this a big one.  Religion and it's absence really says a lot about a fantasy game.  There is a little work involved in this one in deciding on Domains, powers and favored weapons of the various spiritual predilections.  We have to consider how arcane magic is perceived in a religious world or how the various possible planar being think about wizards especially as they become more and more powerful.  Right now this only needs to be a few sentences and ideas and can get further developed through play.  More will be considered if any of the characters are clerics.<br/><br/>4. What is the primary conflict for the PC's people?<br/><br/>We're looking at broad stroke right now.  There should be some overarching trouble stewing for the denizens of your new world.  Is it imperialism?  Slavery?  Religious persecution?  Racial strife?  Outright war?  Not only will a few sentences about this topic color the sorts of conflicts the party will face it will also help to hint at the role Wizards may have in society.<br/><br/><i>Continued on the next thread...</i><br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110298/#Comment_110298" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T09:17:28+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  9:17AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2007 9:18AM by eruditus.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><i>Continued from last thread...</i><br/>5. What is the most dangerous thing wizards have to deal with?<br/><br/>Now we get down to a common theme that the players have to work within.  Is magic outlawed?  Do wizard's have to be registered?  Are they governed by a paranoid substrata of their own kind?  Do many wizards go mad?  Again this will create a push for a good part of the campaign.<br/><br/>Designer's Note:  I already have a good idea of how I might suggest we proceed with this.  I think magic is building up and feeding some sort of coming storm.  In preparing for 4th Edition I'd like there to be some massive magical catastrophe that the characters may have had a hand in but could not actively stop it \u2013 more prepare for it or slow it's arrival.  In this way when the characters cast spell they add to the power of the storm.  When it gets to a certain point there is a reality shift and the players will create new characters from the ground up as similar or as different as they see fit.  Of course, not only is there a paradigm shift (dictated by us having a new rule set to learn) but it could cause other interesting problems for the players.  It's something that is still a bit of a work in progress.  More on this as we move forward.<br/><br/><b>6. I was unhappy with the 6th question so I need to retool it.</b><br/><br/>7. What do people use to scribe?<br/><br/>Writing is going to be a big deal in the game.  How ideas are passed along and spells are kept, what the paper is made out of and what sorts of inks are used add details to the game that should be near and dear to the hearts of these powerful scholars.<br/><br/>8. What are the people's favorite pastime?<br/><br/>A lot of games so focus on jobs and responsibilities that we sometimes miss the most definitive aspect of culture \u2013 recreation.  How the character's relax and get their energy back will determine where they spend their hours when they are not studying or crawling around some cavernous hole and how much time they will spend in recreational endeavors.<br/><br/>9. What is it that all wizards need to cast arcane spells?<br/><br/>This is a great way to make the game yours.  Each gaming group will be a little different.  Do wizards have to cut themselves or sacrifice small animals?  Do they utilize gems and baubles to focus their energies or does every wizard have a staff that they create as part of the initiation through the ranks?<br/><br/>10. What alignment choices are unavailable to PCs (see the alignment section for more info on Alignment)<br/><br/>Alignment consists of Morality and Ethics. There are three Moralities - Good, Neutral and Evil. There are three Ethics - Lawful, Neutral and Chaotic.  Once everyone understands what relevance each alignment has in the game everyone should collectively agree on one morality or ethic to remove.  Then come up with a social reason why members of that morality or ethic become NPCs, removed from play as PCs.  It should be due to some sort of alienation with society around them or incompatibility with how the players see Wizard's behaving.  Quite frankly, if the players cannot agree on this one point the group should seriously consider if they should be playing together.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110307/#Comment_110307" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T09:34:44+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  9:34AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?p=4730258#post4730258" rel="nofollow">Questions Based Setting Creation</a><br/><br/>And I'll be back when I have a moment to tinker with your questions.

Let me rework these.<br/><br/>Oddly enough the scribe one is crazy important to me.  it really adds so much flavor to the game since the tools of the trade will be something that informs nearly every scene.<br/><br/>Maybe I can take the questions I have and just turn them up a notch.<br/><br/>1.

But I completely love the idea of other players taking this and running with it all sinister-like.<br/><br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110386/#Comment_110386" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T12:10:36+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 12:10PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't call it World "Burning" unless you're Luke Crane, author of <i>Burning Wheel</i> and <i>Burning Empires</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110419/#Comment_110419" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T13:20:45+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  1:20PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don,<br/><br/>How's about:<br/><br/>Describe an average non-adventuring day in the life of a wizard...<br/><br/>Just to get an idea of what everyone thinks the day-to-day is like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110430/#Comment_110430" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T14:08:02+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  2:08PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite><br/>3.

No comment on how last night went?<br/><br/>In a nutshell: The evening was an exercise in the art of compromise.  It was painful at times, especially when our die-hard D&amp;Der didn't understand the point of the questions, but overall I think it went pretty well.  <br/><br/>The goblins and dwarves were in a war over control of land.  Goblins were the losers and are likely extinct.  We have a pantheon of gods some aloof and others meddlesome, a demigod who is imprisoned in moutains for bringing magic to the people.  There are magical storms that sweep the land and seem to be growing worse each year.  Enchantment is banned and Wizards shy strongly away from being Lawful.  <br/><br/>We have some fun stuff to work with. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110700/#Comment_110700" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T11:57:04+00:00" title="November 30, 2007 11:57AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joanna,<br/><br/>Thank you.

I have a Mountain Witch game to run for a bunch of non-gamers tonight so I won't get a chance tonight to elaborate.<br/><br/>What Joanna said. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I promise that tomorrow you can all look forward to my AP of teh experience (thanks to you guys it was very positive for both my players and my soul), my Kingdom of Nothing APs and my blog getting updated with the current ruleset including some minor changes from last night.<br/><br/>I VERY MUCH appreciate the interest and enthusiasm!!<br/><br/>So lets talk about two points here:<br/><br/>Although I want to cover specifics the compromise that Joanna is speaking of was often 1/2 the players meeting the challenege and coming up with pure awesome and one or two folks bringing it down a notch into what I can only assume was a safe zone.<br/><br/>My opinion on the source of this is that the core D&amp;Ders are really more about simulating the fantasy reality and had their heads firmly in "reality."  As such there was a lot of talk of "would the people in this world really act like that?" and my answer was "that's what we're deciding right here."  I am actually happy with much of the comprimise because I feel that it's not only bringing the traditional gamers up a notch but it brings things down to a level where we're closer to accomplishing one of the big tasks of this "still being D&amp;D."<br/><br/>Briefly (because I am a sucker for enthusiasm):<br/>1. What was the cause of the last race war and how was your family involved?<br/>A land war between Dwarves and goblins.  Somewhere out there is the last goblin <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>2. Why don't divine and arcane spell casters trust one another?<br/>Gods need worship to a certain degree and thus wizards are bucking the system by gaining power without them.  <br/><br/>3. What is the primary conflict for the PC's people? <br/>There is a climate change that is becoming more and more evident over the past 100 years after wipig out the goblins (who were the nature animists...go figure).  Famine and hardship is just around the bend.<br/><br/>4. What is the most dangerous thing wizards have to deal with? <br/>Eddys and flows of magically unstable areas make some schools function better and others become weakend all to lead up to a big magica storm.<br/><br/>5. Name an arcane school of magic and why is it banned?<br/>Enchantment.  People are most afraid of wizards controlling them.  There were some bad folk that tried to rule the roost back in the day and it left a bad taste in the mouth.<br/><br/>6. What about the scribing process make normal folk avoid matters of the arcane arts?<br/>There is a work ethic involved.  The populace looks down on scribing and letters in general and values hard work and manual labor.  Magic is a social cop out.<br/><br/>7. The common people rioted and looted razing one of the influencial cities. Who remembers when it happened and what would they say caused it?<br/>The angel trapped in a mountain cause the riots by bringing magic back to the people after the last magic storm hit.  The gods didn't like this and the angel has been vilified for it.<br/><br/>8. What price do all arcane spell casters pay to cast spells?<br/>They are not very socially ept.  They have a Charisma cap of 10.  Cloistered living and dedication to the arcane makes them pretty anti-social.  That dictates to me that Enchanter's magic is charisma based and they are charisma power-houses!!!<br/><br/>9. Pick an alignment that wizards avoid at all costs and why.<br/>Lawful.  With the society bent and the idea that wizards should not dabble in politics (part of our lines and veils was that we don't have too heavy a political bent to the game).  See my description to better understand their ideas there.  Wizards are more interested in preserving balance or person rights and infringements.<br/><br/>10. Each player name a historical/mythical figure whose stories most influenced your character and what they did.<br/>I will cover this later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110848/#Comment_110848" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T16:41:27+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  4:41PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really dig this... so much so in fact that I might cobble it a little into the ol' heartbreaker.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111120/#Comment_111120" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T09:49:36+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  9:49AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I updated my blog and the Wizard's campaign information including a rundown of the session.
