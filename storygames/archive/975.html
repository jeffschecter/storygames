                            There's the potential for a big disconnect on this in The Roach, where you may actually end up rolling dice for both sides in a conflict.  That's a fringe case, but it is absolutely true that player and character will not be in agreement in every conflict.  <br/><br/>I think it is an interesting example because there's a fierce "step on up" vibe that's all about the player, who is narrating and framing scenes to benefit themselves, but often constrained in weird ways by the cards, which are all about the character.                        </div>

                            Uh ... are there <b>any</b> conflict resolution (as opposed to task resolution) systems that focus on the fictional intent of the character, rather than the real intent of the player?  I'm not thinking of any right now.<br/>
<br/>
Capes, Dogs, PTA, BtI, Polaris, WGP ... all of those are player intent.<br/>

Is TSOY character intent once you go to BDTP?<br/>

                            Ok, so at Dexcon I got a chance to play in Shawn's CUPS (Soon to be "One night") game.  It was pretty awesome, but more importantly, it illustrates this point pretty clearly.<br><br>In the system, the stakes are broken down into three possibilities,  the good outcome, the not so good outcome, and the not so good outcome.  So, given that, my character ends up in a situation where Titania (who's unrequited love for my character was one of the major threads) offers to rescue him from the pursuing Jabberwock.  We talked it out, and the outcomes were as follows:<br>Good: Declines, and manages to use Titania as a distraction for the beast, and escapes by diving back into the hedge maze.  Titania adds a Scorned descriptor.<br>Not so good: Accept, and am indebted to Titania.<br/>Bad: Accept, and as a price, Titiania makes me sacrifice my cold iron sword for one made of glass which will mark me as working with fairy's to mortals, and be recognizable as Titania's to other fairies, including Oberon.<br/><br/>You would not believe how much I swore when I won that roll.  I woul dhave been totally jazzed with the Bad, but the dice betrayed me.  THis became a recurring theme over the course of the game, as I could not lose a throw, no matter how hard I tried, so I missed numerous potential complication.<br/><br/>We discussed this problem in the post mortem, specifically the possibility of making the win into the thing the _player_ wants most, but despite my frustrations, I strongly disagreed for a simple reason.  What is good and bad for my character is a far simpler rubric to use than sorting them by the outcome _I_ want.  It turns what might be an overly complex weighing of factors into a simple list, bing bang boom, good to go.  There is to omuch risk in stakes-setting games of time being spent in the metagame portion of play as is, so anything that makes the decision process go more smoothly is a welcome addition for me.<br/><br/>Now, shawn's tweaked the system in other ways, so my outcomes are less likely now, and I think it's a big improvement, but at the time, it really crystalized the practicality of using the character to frame these things.  It also illustrated the importance of making sure that winning is as interesting as losing, which is counter-counterintuitive, but critical.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Indeed.  Tony, how could it be any different?  Your character is a creation of you, and you alone.  Your self is a product of not only your own consciousness, but your subconscious, whatever multipersonal unconscious elements that may or may not exist, and biological processes that even today are only thinly understood.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite>Indeed.  Tony, how could it be any different?  Your character is a creation of you, and you alone.  Your self is a product of not only your own consciousness, but your subconscious, whatever multipersonal unconscious elements that may or may not exist, and biological processes that even today are only thinly understood.<br><br>The idea that I might know myself better than I know a character I made... that's just crazy talk.</br></br></blockquote>
Not at all.  Do you mean that you've never been surprised by a direction that you've taken a character?  Not the direction that the character has gone in because of the shape of the narrative or whatever - but a decision that you've made for your character which you never would have expected when you originally conceived of them?  <br/><br/>Now that I find odd.<br/><br/>My longest-running character (Vampire) is a dead Chicagoland mobster who was in torpor for seventy years and is totally disconnected from the present as a result.  He started out as your average tough-guy character, but was mostly bluster surrounding this interior of confusion and misapprehension about the world he's woken up in.  Somewhere in the narrative, he wound up falling in love with one of the other characters - a young man who was embraced at a seminary college in the 50s.  <br/><br/>It was totally unexpected by me (as a player) that this would happen.  But it made perfect sense with who my character, Anthony, was and the sort of relationship that developed between them.<br/><br/>And your character is never your own - it is always a compromise position between your own pure expression and the ruleset that you're working with - and that's just for starters.  Even the lightest, hippiest game requires compromise from you to create a character that fits inside the rules.                        </div>

                            This is a phenomenon frequently commented-upon by authors. It's entirely true. I had a minor character in my novel who I was thinking of as kind of a villain or at least unsympathetic, but at the end he turned out really likeable, a bluff, merry chap completely different from the sinister revolutionary leader I'd been picturing. <i>And it happens by itself.</i><br/><br/>If I was Jungian I could go on about elements of the collective unconscious having their own independent existence, but I'm not, so I won't. <br/><br/>People - even imaginary people - have their own internal logic that we understand intuitively, even when it surprises us at a conscious level. There's an idea around that having a "theory of mind" - a mental picture of how other people think and feel and respond - is part of being well-adapted social beings and was a significant evolutionary step (hints of it are seen in apes). Sociopaths are missing bits of it; autistics are missing different bits. <br/><br/>When your character seems to take on an independent existence, this is because your theory of mind is operating well.                        </div>

                            My playtest Chthonian game had some very explicit player vs. character stuff. Nothing with mechanics, but very much in the rules.<br/>Check out page 4 at <a href="http://www.harlekin-maus.com/chthonian/chthonian_playtest_1_2.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.harlekin-maus.com/chthonian/chthonian_playtest_1_2.pdf</a> </div>

                            Oh sure!  Characters get away from me sometimes, both in writing and in roleplaying.<br/><br/>But I think and say and do strange things that I don't understand <i>all the freakin' time.</i> </div>
