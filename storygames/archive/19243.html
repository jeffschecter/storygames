It does a lot of great stuff.  But I have found it <b>slow as HELL</b>.  In a scene involving 3 PC's and maybe 2-3 NPC's, it's not uncommon for a combat scene to last 2 hours.  This may not be slow for folks accustomed to D&amp;D 3.5 or 4e, but for my gang of mostly OSR-types, the conflicts start out fun and then after about an hour become just more of the same.<br/><br/>Part of this is the nature of MHR's mechanics.  In order to do anything, you form a die pool - hopefully narrating how this stuff comes into play.  If you're doing anything tricky with your dice, that requires a step of calculation and possible additional description.  Then you do some more calculation once you roll: which dice came up with 1's showing, which dice to I want to use for my total, which die do I want to use for my effect.  Again, you might want to do some tricky stuff with your dice once you've rolled them, which requires some extra thought.<br/><br/>And that's just half of resolution: once you take an action, the opponent gets to react, which entails all the same steps.  (In fact, depending on what super power you're using, <i>multiple</i> characters might have to roll reactions.)<br/><br/>Some things I've thought about:<br/>* Keep scenes small.  Oh god, keep them small.  This is kind of a drag given that super hero stuff is about wild and crazy set-pieces, but if it keeps play moving that's fine - we can do a big crazy set-piece every once in a while.<br/><br/>* Figure out what happens if you bump down the "stress tracks" to max out at d10 instead of d12, possibly for all characters, possibly for some characters only.  Part of the slowness of <i>Marvel Heroic</i> is that it takes a long while to wear someone down.  If you've got small-sized dice in your power set, you may need to hit an enemy 4-5 times to really knock them out if you're not sharp about spending your "plot points," which means making maybe 8-10 attacks.  Reducing the number of hits needed, at least for "second-tier" characters, might improve matters.  Maybe.<br/><br/>* Figure out what happens if you only need a single d12 "doom die" to end a scene, or if you can do it with 3d10 "Doom Dice" or something.  <i>Marvel Heroic</i> has this rule where the GM can end a scene early by spending some of his special resources; the trouble is, these resources take a while to accumulate.  <br/><br/>* Figure out how to resolve stalemated scenes.  Sometimes I have the necessary 2d12 "doom dice" to resolve a scene early, but neither side has an obvious advantage.  Ugh!  So now we have to play out another round or two just to figure out who wins the tie-breaker.<br/><br/><b>Does anyone else thing that Marvel Heroic runs slow, and if so, what have you done to speed it up?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428732/#Comment_428732" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T16:59:04+00:00" title="February 24, 2014  4:59PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2 hours?

'Um, I don't have a cool quip.' I say." and grabs the dice and rolls 'em.  A turn takes maybe a minute per player. Maybe two if they're using a SFX they normally don't use? Sometimes I interrupt with a cool mechanical idea. But in any event it never lasts more than 2-3 minutes or so. Since I don't have to interrupt myself, NPCs take virtually no time. WIth 5 players and 5 opposition pools (this includes some big villains and some pools of minions) that means I get around 20 minutes per go-round for the biggest hootin ist hollerin ist crossover issue throwdown that we ran in our game. Normally people get knocked out or things get simpler on the 2nd or 3rd go-round. I can't remember a time when we went a full hour, and I had five players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428740/#Comment_428740" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T23:15:16+00:00" title="February 24, 2014 11:15PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm honestly perplexed why this is taking so long.  2 hours for 3 PCs and 2-3 NPCs?!

Previously I was finding that I was calling for dice every time someone said "I hit him". That was leading to an incredibly stop-start vibe to the fights. Now I encourage people to describe whole exchanges and revel in using their super-powers. Once things hit a bit of a crisis-point, I ask for dice pools.<br/><br/>I also felt like I needed to improve the way I taught the game. So I wrote a semi-hack of MHRP called '<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3362532/Introduction%20to%20Superheroism%20%28a%20Marvel%20Heroic%20RPG%20hack%29.pdf" rel="nofollow">Introduction to Superheroism</a>' to step me and the groups I play with through it.<br/><br/>One rules-hack I do use is that if a character wants to help, they just hand over a die for the help they're giving.

Add two of them together, the expected outcome is 9. For the top two of 3d8 the expected outcome only rises to 11 or so. For the top two of 4d8 the expected outcome only rises to 12.

This enables the GM to win a reaction easily, and then spend d6 doom to turn her successful reaction into a counter-attack.  <br/><br/>(IME the game really works by using these counter-attack options, and also by spending plot points to add extra dice to your total to step up your effect die.)<br/><br/>One trouble with keeping the Doom Pool loaded with d6's is that it's very hard to breed d12's.  You kind of have to breed the doom pool up first, and then gather a bunch of d6's later.  (Alternately, maybe keeping the Doom Pool low makes the game run faster, I don't know.  My approach has been to keep the doom pool small and high-value so I can get to 2d12, and then grow it as needed.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428884/#Comment_428884" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T08:19:19+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  8:19AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2014 8:20AM by JDCorley.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But you get a plot point when you roll a 1, which is the most powerful thing in the game.

Furthermore, with a very small pool, not only will you fail in your action, but the GM can then hammer you on the reaction, basically getting a free turn.  I'm not saying that a small pool is bad play - it's certainly dramatic and maybe speeds things up - but I can certainly understand a player's desire to roll 4-6 dice if they can justify it.  I suspect that's the mechanical justification for SFX like Multipower and Versatile, as well as being able to split your Specialities down into smaller dice.<br/><br/>As to the merits of earning plot points, I agree that getting 1+ plot points on a roll is probably better than succeeding.  But arguably the best thing you can do with a plot point is keep another die to add to your total, or keep another effect die, and both of those presuppose a pool of at least 4 dice and ideally more when you really gotta throw down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan" title="lin_fusan"><img alt="lin_fusan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan">lin_fusan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428893/#Comment_428893" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T10:41:24+00:00" title="February 27, 2014 10:41AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Doom Pool also has an interesting narrative effect: when it gets large, or when some d12s appear, my players start feeling that things have become dire, and they get excited as they whittle it down.

Trying to (over)explain dice going into Doom is really not that useful or interesting (at least, not more useful or interesting than the description and dice pools the players put together for their action). The tension of adding dice to Doom is enough, you don't need to talk it to death and distract from the actions of the PCs, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Spending OUT of Doom, though, that's worth talking about. As lin_fusan and JDCorley point out, it's exciting when Doom gets whittled down, and knowing that the GM just had to pull a d8 out of there so that Baron Von Badguy could avoid taking physical stress from that attack feels good. Don't pass up an opportunity to say what the villains just did (and what you paid out of Doom to make happen).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428905/#Comment_428905" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T14:52:47+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  2:52PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One thing that I think I should do, but keep forgetting because the game is slow enough (for me) already, is to narrate what the heck causes the doom pool to grow.

If you're already going too slow, you don't really lose something by not doing this. But you SHOULD have a transparent doom pool and loudly/maliciously announce when you're using it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429834/#Comment_429834" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T12:14:35+00:00" title="March 24, 2014 12:14PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could it be that maybe you are just playing fights until the bad guy gets taken out?
