I've never had a strong sense of "being there". <br/><br/>I do get pretty strong images when I'm very engaged: when I'm GMing, or playing a full-on storygame. In other words, if there's a constant need to be on my toes and be ready to perform, I immerse pretty well. This isn't true, however, in most trad games, so as a player in them my mental imagery is weak. Unsurprisingly, when playing in trad games I've often been bored.<br/><br/>I therefore ask questions thus: What can I do to improve this? Are there techniques I can learn?<br/><br/>If you immerse a lot in slow-paced games: How do you do it? What do you do in your head?<br/><br/>In the next post, I'll explain what I've tried so far, then the floor is open.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395728/#Comment_395728" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T12:18:42+00:00" title="November  1, 2012 12:18PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently a player in a couple of games (a face-to-face Pathfinder one and a DungeonWorld one over Roll20 VTT). In the last few sessions of those I've making an effort at _visualisation_ - I've been consciously building a picture in my head. I think to myself <i>"What could my character see from here?"</i>. I deliberately fill in details - <i>"Can I see the sky from here?"</i>. I ask the GM for more as I realise there are gaps -  <i>"what is the ground made of here, anyway?"</i>.<br/><br/>Results from the first three sessions are good - I've seen more impressive pictures than I've ever seen instinctively. More than that - I've managed the sound of the salt river grinding nearby, damp wind in my face, the feel of weathered tiles under my hand. I've never had that in RPGs before. So far, this has been pretty rewarding - almost magical at times.<br/><br/>When my character is out of the spotlight (e.g. sitting on the roof of a ruined tower, waiting for the party to catch up) I just immerse and experience the scene.<br/><br/>Combat is harder. I've tried using a kind of flow-freeze-flow visualisation, as if the animation runs for a few seconds (e.g. one turn by one character) then slows to a pause again. Sometimes other players are starting the next move while I'm still imagining e.g. reeling from the last impact.  <br/><br/>I've been going first-person with this... mostly. I've accidentally framed a few "shots" from third-person (seeing my character). I suspect that first-person will give me better results overall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395747/#Comment_395747" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T14:01:45+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  2:01PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2012 2:03PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The techniques you've picked sound like they're working!  Kudos.<br/><br/>Two techniques I sometimes use to get relevant info quickly are to assume out-loud and to ask for exceptions.  <br/><br/>If the GM says "Alley" and nothing more, I might ask, "Like a creepy, shady, dark alley?  Or just a mundane gap between buildings?"  If the GM's attention is elsewhere, they can just say "the former" and I still get something for my imagination to work with.  <br/><br/>If there's an opportunity for a follow-up question, I'll often ask, "Anything unusual about it?"  This is not just a factual question but also a creative prompt the GM can run with.  Many GMs will want to take the bait and add a neat detail.  (Note: this does <i>not</i> work when the GM thinks you're fishing for tactical advantages.  They'll likely just say "nope".  So it depends on the expectations in your game.)<br/><br/>Beyond that, a general strategy I've adopted is to ask for takeaway info, not measurements.  "How many feet tall is the house?" tends to be less useful than "Are these houses short enough to jump up to?  Is this one taller or shorter than the rest?" and also less evocative (for me -- I know others disagree).<br/><br/>Also, if visual detail floats your boat, lead by example.  When your character does something, portray it as vividly as you can.  This can be with description, or with acting-it-out, or in-between.  I rely heavily on facial expressions, for example.<br/><br/>Maintaining immersion through Pathfinder combat is tough.  I hear you on freeze/flow.  I just do my best to fill my head with in-fiction thoughts during the freeze.  Ask myself silent in-character questions about how bad this is, what I should do next, why this fight is happening, etc.  When the other players are doing interesting stuff, this becomes less necessary; in those cases, I just listen to them and imagine their actions through my character's eyes, maybe even yelling out an in-character reaction ("Nice hit!").  Yeah, it's temporally nonsensical, but it's better than nothing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395751/#Comment_395751" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T14:15:54+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  2:15PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

This is tabletop forum, but going beyond tabletop can  be a way to acquire new skills.<br/><br/>For me, I learned "you are there" immersion much from playing in text, by post, forum and chat.  If you good at getting an immersive you-are-there experiences from books, this might be a useful way to approach it.<br/><br/>It is slower, much slower, but text also allows you to shut out your other senses, and really give room to describing and explore sensations, both physical and mental. During a tabletop rpg you get loads of important information from your senses. Tone of voice, gestures, look, body language etc from multiple persons. And this impressions can be conflicting with the "you-are-there" experience. Looking and listing attentively to a big dude with a deep voice can make it hard to really feel that he is a tiny taking kitten.<br/><br/>In text, you sensory input abut the games reality is limited to words on a screen, and that can make it easier focusing on an internal reality.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Another way text can be used after play is to after the game recreate gaming scenes in more detail. A way to focus in on what was only a vague impression during the gaming session to an extremely high definition memory. Write down your character experiences during a scene, focus in on it, try to really bring it alive.<br/><br/>if you done that some of the vividness you brought forth then can make it easier to feeling of really being there during the next session.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Finally seeing is believing. Get a lot of pictures, of characters, places and NPCs. Having a clear picture of how things look can make it easier to bring it alive in your head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396598/#Comment_396598" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T11:01:05+00:00" title="November  6, 2012 11:01AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Elin, I'll maybe have a go with those.

I did a ten-session Starblazer Adventures run about three years back. The books hadn't been printed at that point, so we only had the PDF from the preorder, and I didn't have a way to make it available at the table. I didn't bring any pictures of my own to establish e.g. what a starship looks like, and I had several complaints from the players that their mental images were vague throughout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400480/#Comment_400480" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T11:27:41+00:00" title="December 11, 2012 11:27AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A brief update - I'm still working on this.
