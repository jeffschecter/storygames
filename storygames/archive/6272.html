If not then please strike it with my apologies Andy! </b><br/><br/>My geek side is suffering.  We gamers rally hard to welcome everyone.  We rally to make sure we are all having fun.  We rally to make gaiming more welcoming to non-gamers.  But not for me anymore.  I think we are too focused on catching new gamers that we are beginning to forget our current friends and current gamers.  <br/><br/>In the gaming community I have noticed that we say on a pretty constant basis via boards and emails:<br/><br/>"We should always invite everyone to our games!!"  (and yet I don't get an invite to theirs and then get nailed if I want to host a game at my house for only a select few.)<br/><br/>"We need to be more open minded to other's ideas!!"  (and yet I get told that what I've suggested is 'not cool' and/or 'stupid' and then I am ignored.)  Not to say I can't be uncool or stupid.  Far from it.  When I see someone else mention THE SAME EXACT THING, they get no retaliation for their thoughts and words.  And then further discussion takes place about the topic until all are happy and hugging again.  But not me.  I sit staring at my screen like a confused puppy wondering if I've read what I see correctly.  <br/><br/>(There are plenty more examples but those are the two that stick out to me the most.)<br/><br/>I've asked this question once before too... should I just become a gamer wife?  I know that my being female, a gamer, and someone's wife have caused issues in games before because of the simple jealousy of it all.  (e.g. why won't my wife play?!  Eric what did you do that got Lisa gaming?)  And thus my continued arrival at the table becomes uncomfortable for others.  I leave the table and I hear tales of how great things are.  For the record, I've always been a gamer and I have the scars to prove it.    I am relegated to playing only at my table, Mark's table and Andy's table as those are the only places I feel welcome anymore.  And you have no idea how much that makes me happy guys!  Seriously.  <br/><br/>Or... now seriously think about this one... is it that you've just remembered that I'm a witch?  Now this one funny enough I can actually understand.  I've had lots of people not invite me into their homes/lives anymore after years of knowing me. Somehow they find out about my religous beliefs (or figure it out as I've never hidden it!) and I'm out of their lives.  <br/><br/>But I thought we gamers were above all that petty bullshit.  Am I wrong?  <br/><br/>I've talked to Eric about this and he's noticed this trend as well but can offer me no advice as he's not sure what's going on either.  Has anyone else noticed this?<br/><br/>Or is it me and I just have less gamer friends than I thought I did?  Do I expect too much from my fellow gamers?  I look upon all of my fellow gamers as intellecutals and interesting people to talk with about all sorts of things (not just gaming).<br/><br/>What's happened?  Is it something I said?  Is it something I did?  Is there something on my face? <br/><br/>So come on guys let me have it.  Let me know what the hell is going on.  If I've offended, let me know! I'm a witch but I'm not psychic!  I'm a big girl and I can take it.  I just want to know what the hell is happening in my corner of the gaming world.  I miss it and want to be part of it again. <br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>Lisa P                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan" title="urbanpagan"><img alt="urbanpagan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v225/urbanpagan/Other%20Schtuff/urbanpaganavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan">urbanpagan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138965/#Comment_138965" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T07:24:33+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  7:24AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot to mention that the only reason I've not played at my own table lately is just because of my classes.<br/><br/>Lisa P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138967/#Comment_138967" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T07:31:31+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  7:31AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well all I can say is that I don't know you <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I don't know that you are a witch, a woman, a wife or any other sort of word beginning with a 'w'. All I know is that you are a gamer, because otherwise you would not have posted here. I also don't believe I have ever seen you post on a thread I have posted on (though I am usually proven wrong when I say things like that).<br/><br/>If you had, though, I'd have had nothing to go on but what you said, which is the nice thing about the Internet. If you post on forums with other people who don't know you then the same must be true, so much as as you might feel the people responding might be bothered by real-life facts about you (and they shouldn't, but people are) then it wouldn't be true.<br/><br/>On the other hand if you are talking about real-life interactions, or emails / forum posts by people you do know in real life, then sadly bias can come into play, and surely will. I post on various forums and I know of at least one where various people will not respond to things I post, or will respond with derision, just of who I am. As it happens I am not a wife, woman or witch, but people can always find reasons to dislike you (by you here I mean anyone), sadly enough. So if that's the case, I sympathise.<br/><br/>All of life, annoyingly, is something of a personality contest, no matter how much well meaning people might like to avoid it being so, and unless you are one of life's winners that sort of social thing can easily get in the way of gaming, just as it can work, home life, or just about anything else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan" title="urbanpagan"><img alt="urbanpagan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v225/urbanpagan/Other%20Schtuff/urbanpaganavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan">urbanpagan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138971/#Comment_138971" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T07:50:27+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  7:50AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you.

Even gamers in communities as good as this one will have their biases or mental blocks.<br/><br/>I'm sorry I can't really speak to your specifics though, since I'm not familiar with them.  I personally don't agree with the "We should always invite everyone to our games!!" concept, at least not as a universal generalization.  There are plenty of people I wouldn't want to game with.  However, I personally wouldn't exclude someone just because they're pagan or female or married (as I've played plenty with all of these types).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139023/#Comment_139023" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T10:16:15+00:00" title="April 10, 2008 10:16AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Quintin Stone</cite>I personally don't agree with the "We should always invite everyone to our games!!" concept, at least not as a universal generalization.</blockquote>\nI have to agree.  I don't know that I've ever actually even heard anyone say something like that, but it's possible that they have and I instinctively scoffed at it so hard that it actually <i>disappeared from my reality.</i>  Because, personally, I'm not into gaming to be part of a worldwide gamer community, or to expand the hobby, or whatever; I game because it's a fun thing I can do with my friends.  I'm in it for personal enjoyment and enriching my connections with the people I'm close to; I don't game with random people off the street for the same reasons I don't invite random people over to celebrate my birthday.<br/><br/>Obviously, this isn't a universal sentiment, and I guess that's probably a good thing, for people who do care about growing the hobby...certainly there are people posting here who are <i>much</i> less insular than I am.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, maybe Lisa is living in an area where people are more like me?  Or maybe <i>she's</i> like me, and just doesn't realize it yet?  Because I would be so uncomfortable sitting down to play with people I didn't know well that I'm sure I would feel unwelcome and put-upon by the entire ordeal, even if they were making an honest effort to include me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139032/#Comment_139032" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T10:32:49+00:00" title="April 10, 2008 10:32AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa: I, like others, do not know you. I have in my past played with witches, women and wives (not all in the same person, necessarily) and have had good and bad experiences, same as any other gamer. <br/><br/>Should you become a "gamer wife"? No, unless that is what you already are or see yourself as. <br/><br/>Are you familiar with the Geek Social Fallacies? <a href="http://www.plausiblydeniable.com/opinion/gsf.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.plausiblydeniable.com/opinion/gsf.html</a><br/><br/>That site, though I see it as flawed, opened my eyes to many of the things we as "gamer geeks" do wrong. Many gamers, to include me to this very day, see ourselves as a society of misfits and outcasts. We may possibly be able to make it in the everyday world, but we only feel comfortable around "our own kind". I feel more in common with a hardcore D&amp;Der than my fellow soldiers, which is kind of crazy. I don't like D&amp;D all that much, while every single soldier has certain common experiences, but there you have it. <br/><br/>So I see where you're coming from. There's this perception in the wider world of gaming that we're more accepting of "gamers" because the world rejects and marginalizes us, but the reality is that we're all just people, with our own prejudices and short-comings. Commonly, though not universally, those short-comings include poor ability to interact socially, which is not left at the door when gamers get together. If we can't interact well with "normal" people, we're not any better equipped to interact with our fellow gamers. <br/><br/>Anyhow.. I feel your pain. While male and Christian, I find that I don't fit in with many of my gamer friends because I'm (excuse the generalizations) too "indie" for my traditional friends, and too traditional for my indie friends. Oh, and I'm not incredibly socially apt either, which always adds to the fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan" title="urbanpagan"><img alt="urbanpagan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v225/urbanpagan/Other%20Schtuff/urbanpaganavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan">urbanpagan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139039/#Comment_139039" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T10:49:13+00:00" title="April 10, 2008 10:49AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Anyway, maybe Lisa is living in an area where people are more like me?

You deserve better, and life is shorter than you think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139045/#Comment_139045" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T10:57:41+00:00" title="April 10, 2008 10:57AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2008 11:01AM by Jarrod.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>I don't game with random people off the street for the same reasons I don't invite random people over to celebrate my birthday.</blockquote>This right here clarifies, in a single sentence, my stance on most gaming experiences and why I'm hesitant to hit up conventions.

Social groups consist of people who are kind and generous with their time and heart, and people who are closed up assholes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately just because these people are sitting around doing something you think is fun, and you all have the common bond of liking role-playing games, they still don't have to like you. They still don't have to welcome you. And their reasons could be anything from being uncomfortable with your religious beliefs to not liking your taste in shoes.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if their behavior isn't something you'd put with from any other social group, cut 'em loose, and invite people to play with you who don't treat you like crap.

But she does cook some mean vegetarian dishes. And I cook a lot of pretty decent vegetarian food too.<br/><br/>If anyone ever asked her "Melissa, how did you get Joe cooking like that?" I'd be furious. I'd be down right choked, and feel like my independence and autonomy and self-direction had been robbed by someone I considered a friend. Thinking about your dilemma was the first time I'd ever considered this fact.<br/><br/>My immediate response to a question like "How can I get my wife gaming" would be "the same way she'll get you [knitting/cross-country skiing/volunteering at a shelter/watching her favourite show/whatever her hobby is]". Because I'm sure in their minds its a legitimate question. Tom loves something, and sharing it with Jill would give Jill a deeper understanding of Tom as well as introduce her to something she might love too. That impulse is happy and healthy and normal. But when you start using language that denies people's independence and self-direction, and when you start talking about that sharing as if it were indoctrination, then it starts to get offensive and weird very quickly. But it's important to understand that the base impulse of sharing is a good one, and that what needs to change is the mindset/approach. So something like "the same way she'll get you jogging with her friends in the morning" might give that necessary paradigm jolt that lets them see how weird their approach is, without disrespecting that impulse to share their love.<br/><br/>My two cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan" title="urbanpagan"><img alt="urbanpagan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v225/urbanpagan/Other%20Schtuff/urbanpaganavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan">urbanpagan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139095/#Comment_139095" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T13:17:55+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  1:17PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joepub,<br/><br/>Exactly!

My reaction is always one of happy to talk about it.  Sadly though I think my answer isn't what they wanted to hear. I've been gaming since I was 4. Yeah.  4.  Mom was my DM and I've played the Little Keep on the Borderlands so many times I could probably draw you the map of the Keep from memory.    <br/><br/>But I digress, I always tell the person asking to word it just like that.  Tell your loved one that you very much enjoy gaming and you'd like them to join you because it would be nice to have them there.  If they say they don't want to ask why, then listen to their answer.  Really listen.  Is s/he scared of public speaking?  Are they afraid they will look bad in front of your friends?  Or do they really just not want to?  Analyze yourself too.  Have they ever asked you to join them in anything?  For example, a guy I met at GenCon 2 years ago emails me still to this day because his wife wants him to go snorkeling with her.  He won't.  Flat out won't.  And he won't tell her why yet he's told me.  And he's incredibly upset that she's not interested in gaming with him.  She's told him why though... she dislikes the people he games with.  One of them really creeps her out... like heebie jeenies for her when he's in the room, level.  The other is that she dislikes the game(s) he's playing.  I reminded him that at least she told him why she's not interested.  He should do the same for her and then realize she's not gonna game with him right now.  Move on. <br/><br/>It's not the question that is the problem.  For me it's sometimes the fact that Eric is asked and I'm sitting RIGHT THERE when they ask.  He turns to me and smiles and says "I don't know, ask Lisa" (or something along those lines).  I think it's the fact that I -am- a gamer and a wife.  My being at the table reminds them of the 'troubles' they are having 'getting' their wife gaming and well... that leads to problems of it's own.  At least that is my interpretation of the situation.  I could be wrong.  I have been given email addys of various wives in an attempt to 'convince them' to game.  When I fail to do so or say I won't talk to her about it that they need to, that's usually when that unwelcome vibe starts.  Side note, I won't talk to her for you because that's just damn rude.  I learned that one the hard way too.  Picture it... a woman she barely knows but can speak in a strange language he understand "2d6 damage!  WOOT!" comes into <span style="text-decoration: underline;">her</span> home and says to her "you need to join us."  Yeah.. it's a strange position to be put into where you wouldn't be defensive and standoffish over it. <br/><br/>You know, I thank you all for this introspection of myself.  I've really started to review myself today and that's a good thing.  You're right... fuck em.  They don't want to invite me to their house anymore... then I'll move on.  My life and self-worth is not dependent upon being invited to their table.  I was just kinda curious as to why it was that I wasn't invited anymore.  You know... I wanted to be sure I hadn't offended anyone.  <br/><br/>Lisa P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139103/#Comment_139103" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T14:12:10+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  2:12PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa,<br/><br/>Here is the script I would use when getting the "how do I get X to Y" question:<br/><br/>Gamer #1: How do I get my girlfriend to game?<br/>Myself: Well... you can't "get" anyone to do anything.

It respects the person's desire for sharing, it introduces new viewpoints into the situation, and it clears up that sexist, ownership-centered idiocy that the questioner probably didn't even realize was ingrained in his thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139112/#Comment_139112" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T14:46:07+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  2:46PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2008 2:47PM by Ry.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: urbanpagan</cite>You know, I thank you all for this introspection of myself.

Also the "We should be open to new idea" then shuting you down suggests to me there's some person in power who, while acting as if everyones equal, is maintaining a firm grip on the alpha position. From your post you seem strong willed, which, whether you want to or not, makes you a threat to such a position.<br/><br/>I don't know this. It'd take extended accounts to try and confirm it. It's just something to consider. Once you get a spine, it's hard to be just one more person in the crowd. On a comforting note, probably many people at these tables regret your abscence, but at the same time are too used to being whisked along by the authority to do anything about it.

Jill doesn't post to any of the gaming sites (she hangs out on a different part of the Internet. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ); she asked me to post her comments for her.  (Doing so makes me a little uncomfortable, since the thread is partly about wives not being mere extensions of their husbands.  I don't want it to seem as if I am marginalizing her by posting on her behalf.)  <br/><br/>Jill says that she has never been asked to 'help get someone else's wife to game'.  Not once, in twenty-some-odd years of gaming.  She says that she figures that the gamers-in-relationships she knows mostly fall into two groups:  The ones who's significant others already game with them, and the ones who game to <i>get away</i> from their significant others for a while.  I game with the same crowd, and I have to say that that seems to be the case...  <br/><br/>She also said that if someone <i>did</i> ask, she wouldn't take offense at the request -- but <i>would</i> take offense at the assumption that I was the one who got her into gaming.  She's been a gamer since grade school, and is emphatically <i>not</i> one of those female gamers who only game so that they can hang out with their boyfriends/husbands.<br/><br/>Among our gaming associates, split across three gaming groups, there are four other married couples, two of the wives game with their husbands, two don't -- and those two aren't interested at all.  Of the two other wives who do game, one is serious about it, the other is just playing in order to hang out with her husband.  There are also a few single males and two single females whom we game with regularly.  Maybe with that mix, the question just doesn't come up.<br/><br/>As far as her religious and spiritual beliefs go, all our friends know that she is a pagan -- but several of the people we game with are atheists who consider <i>all</i> religions to be something of a waste of time.  No one gives Jill or the other pagans any crap about their beliefs, no one gives the semi-devout Catholic, the two Jewish gamers, or the lone Lutheran any crap, either.  The atheist mindset is definitely in the majority, though, so religion doesn't come up as a topic, much, either.<br/><br/>To the OP;  Jill and I both hope that you find a more-accepting group of gamers, or can get your current group to be more accepting of you.  Our circle of gaming friends can be pretty dysfunctional at times -- but at least they aren't dysfunctional in that way.<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139218/#Comment_139218" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T06:48:51+00:00" title="April 11, 2008  6:48AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Lisa,<br/>\n<br/>\nI DO know you (unlike most of the posters above). <br/>\n<br/>\nYou're very cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlways play with friends.

Still, we threw down with some German Board Game (Traders of Genoa, which I am now convinced is a Good Game), then light meal (Pantera Bread) and coffee at It's A Grind : In the Comfy Chairs.<br/><br/>It was a fun night, and something that we (local folks) needed: In brief, most local gaming outside of regular weekly gaming had been canceled or pushed back *months* because it seems that everyone's work schedules were out of control the last few months, and then there was that local flu epidemic which canceled the other half of scheduled events.<br/><br/>All in all, a fun, restful night. Next time we throw down like that, I think I'm going to bust out Feng Shui or Dread and call it an action movie night.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140175/#Comment_140175" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T07:00:50+00:00" title="April 17, 2008  7:00AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2008 7:01AM by Rafael.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Next time we throw down like that, I think I'm going to bust out Feng Shui or Dread and call it an action movie night.</blockquote>\nSounds like a good time!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140189/#Comment_140189" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T08:04:10+00:00" title="April 17, 2008  8:04AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys, come on, let's be honest with Lisa.<br/><br/>There is something on your face.
