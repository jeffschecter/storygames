Their presens is marked with a <del>strike</del> only to be clear where the document changed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Let\u2019s talk about the black curtain here.<br/>There are a few reasons why a GM might hide information.<br/><br/>Let\u2019s say they have a prepared map of a dungeon and its contents. Part of the mode of play is exploration. Exploration is enhanced by the players not knowing the map of the dungeon and where the items are, which items are there. It\u2019s also enhanced by not giving the stats for the monsters they meet. Let\u2019s call this mode \u201cMode X\u201d. \u201cMode X\u201d means that the location and its contents are defined ahead of time but kept secret to the players.<br/><br/>Most players enter a dungeon crawl knowing that parts of this information will initially be secret.<br/><br/>Now, \u201cthe black curtain\u201d <del>and \u201cillusionism\u201d</del> has sometimes been defined as GMs disguising things as if they were prepared according to one mode, for example as \u201cMode X\u201d, but in reality there are other factors leading to how those things operate.<br/>Examples include:<br/>\u2022 \u201cI really want the party to meet this nice ogre so the ogre will be to the left if they go left, but right if they go right. This dorky snail will be in the other direction if they later decide to go down there too.\u201d<br/>\u2022 \u201cMan, the PCs are so powerful, I want them to feel challenged so I\u2019m just going to let the players [OOC] believe that monster HP matter but instead end the fight when I, the GM, feel it\u2019s dramatically appropriate to give them a hero moment.\u201d<br/>\u2022 \u201cOuch, I, the GM, rolled another crit and the player will die. Unless... yes! I can say that the monster missed!\u201d<br/>\u2022 And many others.<br/><br/>Examples don\u2019t include when the prep calls for filling in details like if it says \u201cRubbish heap with nothing of value\u201d, and the players look closely at each piece and the GM has to make things up on the spot like \u201cOK, a melon rind, an orange peel, some dirty leather patches, some leaves...\u201d<br/>The reason I exclude that example, is that I am particularly speaking of the situation where the GM is disguising which mode of play is active.<br/><br/>Now, there can absolutely be a \u201cCopperfield situation\u201d where the players are onboard with the GM using a mixture of these techniques and another mode, for example \u201cMode X\u201d, and they do not want to know the proportions of that mix. I have met at least one player who strongly felt this way, and, as Eero pointed out, this is common in northern Europe. I don\u2019t feel this way and I do not like to <del>participate</del> partake in this mode of play. But that\u2019s just me.<br/><br/>But there is also another pertinent reason why players don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and that\u2019s because \u201cMode X\u201d inherently has secrets. Players may be onboard with respecting the secrets of \u201cMode X\u201d but not onboard with the secrets of the black curtain and the social contract is very hard to navigate here.<br/><br/>The GM might honestly believe \u2014 because of the vagaries of social contract \u2014 that the players are in a \u201cCopperfield situation\u201d, while in reality they might up and leave if they found out that they were not playing in \u201cMode X\u201d. This is probably the most common.<br/><br/>If the whole group is genuinely in a \u201cCopperfield situation\u201d then <em>I don\u2019t see the problem</em>.<br/><br/>But I <em>have</em> met GMs online who are in a \u201cThree Card Monte situation\u201d. They know that the expectation of \u201cMode X\u201d is what brings the players to the table, and they know that the game would forever be ruined if it was revealed that black curtain techniques were in action, but they do it anyway because they believe that the <del>illusion</del> impression of \u201cMode X\u201d that they can present through the curtain is better (more heroic, more dramatic, more better (ETA: more like a story \u2014 but not necessarily a prewritten story, just \u201carcier\u201d)) than the real thing.<br/><br/>(ETA: I\u2019ve also met GMs online, though not on S-G, who think that everyone who is <em>not</em> doing this are bad GMs.)<br/><br/>So, four situations:<br/>A. Genuine \u201cCopperfield situation\u201d<br/>B. GMs mistakenly believe it\u2019s \u201cCopperfield situation\u201d through misunderstandings about the social contract and CA<br/>C. \u201cThree Card Monte situation\u201d.<br/>X. Genuine \u201cMode X\u201d without black curtain techniques.<br/><br/>With all respect and honesty, I have encountered all four situations and it should be obvious that my ire is intended towards B and C.<br/>I also don\u2019t intend to accuse someone who is in one of the four modes to be in another of the four modes.<br/><br/>Now, a wrench in the gear for me personally is that I am very interested in the \u201cMode X\u201d CA and mode of play. The existance of modes A, B and C, however, has made \u201cMode X\u201d problematic. I\u2019ve taken to throwing away my GM screen, showing pages from the module, being open about stat blocks, writing things out in long hand (instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenomelin" rel="nofollow">short hand</a>) so I can show my prep to the players, among other things. This is obviously a chore.<br/><br/>\u201cMode X\u201d techniques that were genuinely useful have been compromised since they can easily be used for black curtain techniques.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436967/#Comment_436967" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T02:36:28+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  2:36AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't get why you, and other people, trying to talk about a game style that you don't like.

As in, it leverages something that can be benign or good, but which is used in a problematic way? I can get behind that.<br/><br/>I feel like, in a lot of traditional gaming culture, there's a "loss of innocence" if you find out your GM's been making stuff up behind the screen just to make the story go along well. A lot of GMs are good at hiding it, but once you've found out, you get the sinking feeling it might be happening everywhere.<br/><br/>Which naturally gets in the way of <b>trust</b>, which is the true enabler of Mode X. You can only really enjoy Mode X when you believe that the GM is being honest with you and challenging you fairly--in that respect, it's like playing a Computer RPG where there's secrets to discover and things to find out.  Which is where we get to the Three Card Monte--which doesn't work with players who already know the Monte.<br/><br/>I think it's in some part a question of properly fulfilling expectations. When you go to play a game expecting Mode X, you're going to feel betrayed in some part when you find out there's been a black curtain in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437004/#Comment_437004" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T06:55:09+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  6:55AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The phrase \u201cblack curtain\u201d came from over at the Forge.

Remember that I defined \u201cMode X\u201d as keeping the stuff secret (but honest).<br/><br/>\u2022 I\u2019ve taken to revealing monster HP and AC. This has benefits of speeding up play dramatically (since players can do more of the math) at the cost of immersion and scariness and uncertainty, and it also warps the tactics. I\u2019ve really enjoyed moments of hidden monster HP, AC and Speed as a player: we don\u2019t know how dangerous the thing is and whether we should run away or stay and fight!<br/><br/>\u2022 I\u2019ve taken to revealing things in the module to players who ask. I\u2019d rather do this after the campaign or after the session, but... I need to build trust!<br/><br/>\u2022 I\u2019ve taken to rolling the NPC/monster \u201csneaking rolls\u201d openly. So the players know that someone or something is sneaking or hiding.<br/><br/>\u2022 And of course, the gimme, that I roll all dice openly.<br/><br/>None of these things have really broken the game, but... they\u2019ve made the game less \u201cMode X\u201d!<br/><br/>They\u2019ve had the benefit of erasing a little of my authority as DM and making it more like it\u2019s us, as a group, engaging with the module.<br/><br/>I need to build trust and I need social armor because we\u2019re playing with character death.

Combat becomes a way of engaging the enemy.<br/><br/>Though also: I like the notion of using systems in a game that allow players to do recon on a monster before they engage them. It'd be cool to see them hiding by a monster's lair until they can observe enough to make a Knowledge: Nature check to learn some of its defenses, or trying to buy time for the party's Sage to get a quick moment and make an assessment in the heat of battle to figure out the creature's current hitpoints.<br/><br/>It'd also be neat if, say, some classes had the ability to do a battle assessment of certain foes. Maybe a Knight who's fighting the warriors of a baron is able to draw on their knowledge of war to figure out their defenses and HP. Maybe a Wizard who's trying to push back against an eldritch abomination is able to draw on their esoteric learning to figure out what its special abilities are.<br/><br/>...this is drifting really far afield. I guess the point I'm trying to make is, yeah, there's a lot of fun stuff you can play with when it comes to secret information. So maybe another thing that makes Mode X work is the expectation that you can leverage the system in order to discover this information.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437051/#Comment_437051" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T09:23:20+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  9:23AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, you\u2019re really selling Mode X, CG!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437055/#Comment_437055" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T09:42:51+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  9:42AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always reveal monster defenses once they've been hit <i>exactly</i>.

In fact, I have no problems with most of the things I've seen portrayed here negatively. I would go so far as to say that many of the things being talked about lately form the basis of our roleplaying experience, and that we love and require them to have our kind of fun.<br/><br/>The only difference/caveat seems to be that we all know about them all, buy into them fully from the start, and use them with a level of skill, dedication and experience that doesn't seem common.<br/><br/>So with that being said:<br/><br/>For us the DM is the great and powerful Wizard of Oz. He is the main plot screenwriter, director, producer, and editor of our little show. When we sit at a DMs table a BIG part of the excitement is that we have NO CLUE what the DM will reveal to us, or how, or what it will mean, or how it will end up. We strive for immersion and simulation, and that means we should only 'know' what our characters 'know', or at least act that way. <br/><br/>This leads us to two sub-points:<br/><br/>1. Please don't mistake this all for suggesting that players have no agency, or don't create their own stories. They do. They're on the creative team that gets to inject many/most of the subplots as well as green-lighting overall genre and tropes, and they're in charge of creating and scripting their characters completely. They offer suggestions and input before and between games, and the DM usually listens and incorporates...but does so within and against the greater story that he is weaving. What's more, he does so without revealing many (if any) details to the characters regarding who/when/how/why. So at best they only have an inkling of an eventual what. <br/><br/>Players are also free to 'go off script', but do so knowing that the further they go afield the less likely they are to discover deep and rich play (since the DM cannot have devoted prep time to things they couldn't have known about). In my experience most only stray sparingly, and with specific intent, before coming back to experience what was prepared for them.<br/><br/>2. In order to 'know what our characters know' we often have to learn much more than that, and then actively choose to filter our awareness of some of the knowledge. The best example I can give is monster information. In D&amp;D it was long thought by many that the Monster Manuals were for the DM, and they were crafted with that in mind (focus on stat blocks for instance). Eventually we started seeing deeper treatments of the major creatures with releases of entire books dedicated to them (Draconomicon for instance). These were written much like an academic introduction to the creatures themselves, not focused on their game mechanics. Suddenly players became the focus of these works and by studying them players could really immerse themselves in what their characters would know about a certain race. If you live with constant threat of Orc invasion you're GOING to know things about Orcs. About their culture, physiology, psychology, religion, etc.<br/><br/>Similarly a veteran warrior will know how hard you have to swing to get through chain vs leather, or dragon hide vs ogre hide, and so on. In this way it's reasonable for the players to know what base AC certain things provide, or certain creatures have, or how much damage a halberd does vs a dart. Nothing is lost by the players having this information. Just remember that it's only the starting point of information.<br/><br/>Now, in learning about these creatures you'll likely get more info than you really should have (such as the stat block). It will all depend on your character how much you should know, and then up to the player to incorporate only the viable information into their roleplaying. We also all know that the DM, being an all-powerful creator and destroyer of worlds and realities, can alter any written word to fit his needs in telling a specific story. Therefore while we know what we know, and often know what we shouldn't know, we have no way to know if what we think we know is actually what is. That is perhaps the best, most exciting part for us in that it creates an very accurate reality because while most of us think we know things about the real world our perceptions are frequently (I'd wager usually) wrong.<br/><br/>So yes, as a player you'll know that an orc in leathers will have around a 7 AC. As a character you'll know instead that orcs are generally unskilled in crafting and wear rudimentary armors, relying instead on numbers and strength to win the battle, making them fairly easy to strike in combat with only limited training or experience. However, only the DM will know that this particular orc was born with the grace and speed of bruce lee and obtained these +3 leathers when a retired guard captain turned hermit died of old age in his mountain cabin giving him a final AC of 0. <br/><br/>Unless, of course, your character is the son of the new guard captain, and recognizes the leather armor. Or unless you're a dedicated warrior monk who has studied physiology and can recognize exceptional body mechanics. Therein lies the power of roleplaying and story over mechanics and DM fiat/rule 0/black curtain.<br/><br/>This doesn't hold only for monsters mind you, but geography, history, and so forth. <br/><br/>This second point is where most of the depth of our play originates from. We strive for players who are informed enough about all world aspects to successfully immerse themselves into whatever the DM designs, without having any clue what it all means or where it will lead. Details, immersion and simulation coupled with dedicated ignorance and obfuscation is the formula for our success. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>In the game the DM works diligently to remove or hide as much mechanical awareness as possible to keep the focus on the storytelling and roleplaying. The players don't really want to know, though they'll often seem to be trying to figure it out, as is human nature. Therefore you won't hear much talk about about stats during a fight, other than what's necessary. For instance the players will announce 'that would hit an AC 4', to which the DM will announce rather or not it was a hit (and vice versa when the opponents attack the players). Of course, this serves the dual purpose of allowing the DM to dynamically adjust scripted events to account for variances experienced during gameplay. While it's not common to see too much of it, it's sometimes essential (and expected by the players at our tables).<br/><br/>The DM may also employ subjective mapping/scripting such as you describe wherein the contents or events are experienced based on elements other than physical location or chronology. This too is known, and expected, in order to most effectively tell the story the players are experiencing. <br/><br/>However, if the group instead wanted a strictly 'play it as scripted' adventure (mode x) we would all abide. It would simply come with the stipulation that any reductions in the experience (or potential TPWs) be accepted as inherent within that playstyle. It is, for us, a transition from a more story-oriented game to a more gamist or strictly simulationist game...which is fine, so long as its known going in. I'd say 1 out of 8 or 10 of our games employ this style; except when we run something like AD&amp;D 3rd edition, which is inherently geared towards this.<br/><br/>So in other words, everyone who plays at our tables not only expects the curtain usually, they actively work to keep it in place in order to facilitate the style of play they enjoy. Knowing its there not only heightens excitement, it encourages focus on depth and breadth of roleplay and story to overcome mechanical fluctuation. When we change to a pure 'mode x' style we simply trust in the strength of our social contract, and the honor of our players. In 30+ years we've seldom be disappointed in doing so. Of course, we're blessed to be playing with many of the same people over that entire time, and we only play with true friends and family who we also think are good people. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437109/#Comment_437109" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T16:31:14+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  4:31PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2014 4:31PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Players are also free to 'go off script', but do so knowing that the further they go afield the less likely they are to discover deep and rich play (since the DM cannot have devoted prep time to things they couldn't have known about).</blockquote>Great post, Phoenix.

In fact some games are entirely based on that style. However, since our preferred style is founded on details and preparation it falls short for us more often than not. It works great for the subplots or minor diversions, but simply can't have the kind of depth and nuance 20 hours of careful prep can provide.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437119/#Comment_437119" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T17:45:09+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  5:45PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2014 5:45PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, true.

You took the time and care to write a long post. Thank you for that.<br/>Unfortunately, it seems to me that I was unclear in my earlier posts.\n<blockquote>When we sit at a DMs table a BIG part of the excitement is that we have NO CLUE what the DM will reveal to us, or how, or what it will mean, or how it will end up.</blockquote>\nThis is shared by all four of the modes, A, B, C and X.<br/><br/>The bulk of your post, from the start and uptil the three asterisks, are about these benefits, shared between all four of the modes.<br/>And that\u2019s fine, I see that as very welcome and helpful to the thread.<br/><br/>However, what I have found myself doing lately is to sacrifice these benefits in order to not be suspected of playing in mode B or C, which are modes that I personally currently want to avoid. I.e. erasing the \u201cMode X\u201d:ness of the game in favor of more overtly stated numbers and elements \u2014 in other words, not playing in any of the four modes even though \u201cMode X\u201d has a lot of benefits. That dilemma is what prompted this thread.\n<blockquote>However, if the group instead wanted a strictly 'play it as scripted' adventure (mode x) we would all abide.</blockquote>\nTo clarify, \u201cMode X\u201d does not mean pre-scripted events or plot. It means prepared locations and contents. Encounter tables and other randomness is allowed by \u201cMode X\u201d, but the GM changing, say, a monster\u2019s hit points is not \u201cMode X\u201d, it\u2019s one of the other modes.\n<blockquote>So in other words, everyone who plays at our tables not only expects the curtain usually, they actively work to keep it in place in order to facilitate the style of play they enjoy.</blockquote>\nIn this sentence I quoted from phoenix182, I guess the curtain is defined as the secrecy shared by all four of the modes, rather than the techniques shared by the first three modes.<br/>I\u2019m not sure which of the two definitons is most in line with common usage, or which one I want to keep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437214/#Comment_437214" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T00:24:54+00:00" title="August 14, 2014 12:24AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Always define something for what it is, not what it's not.</blockquote>\nThis is good advice.<br/><br/>However, I feel that sometimes contrast or a lack can be the best way to explain what something is.

The point is only to discuss the modes in relation to <em>games that, from the perspective of the players, look like \u201cMode X\u201d</em>.<br/><br/>Modes A, B, and C all add this:<br/>\u2022 The DM sometimes depart from the prep or from the rules in order to create a better experience for the players. Such as occasionally secretly changing the result of a die roll, or using the \u201cWhichever door the player\u2019s open first, there\u2019s the giant bee, and behind the second door they open is the potion of frobnication\u201d trick.<br/><br/>Mode A adds this:<br/>\u2022 The DM and the players both know <em>and like</em> that this is going on and the player\u2019s explicitly <em>don\u2019t want to know</em> exactly when and how often it happens, they\u2019ve given blanket permission for use of the techniques.<br/><br/>Mode B adds this instead:<br/>\u2022 The DM honestly and sincerely believe that they are playing in Mode A, but the player\u2019s believe that they are playing in \u201cMode X\u201d.<br/><br/>Mode C adds this instead:<br/>\u2022 The DM believes that the players want \u201cMode X\u201d and would rebel against the techniques used, but continues because the DM feels that the play experience, the impression of \u201cMode X\u201d that the DM can provide, is more satisfying to the players on a number of levels, and the DM feels like they can successfully keep the secret that the table is really in \u201cMode C\u201d and not in \u201cMode X\u201d.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Again, rather than criticising modes A, B and C (heaven knows my opinion on modes B and C have already been made quite clear), I see benefits of mode X and want to explore it.<br/><br/>I\u2019m know to have the problem \u201cperfect is the enemy of good\u201d. I find a technique or way of playing and I become zealously enamoured with it to the point of not being able to implement it in practice.<br/>\u201cPerfect is the enemy of good\u201d is why I couldn\u2019t get started with ACKS (one of the best OSR games but I should\u2019ve just started with Mentzer Basic, worked myself up to Mentzer Expert, and then to ACKS) \u2014 it was too much to truly grok in one go.

He can really dress up advice in game mechanics. <b>Feng Shui</b> got rules like "The player can change the character between sessions if the character feels wrong" or "If a player talks about the stats or powers of the monster, the monster got +5 on all stats". Gaming advice, set in rules.<br/><br/>It warms my heart to see that someone got Matin\xe9. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>Rickard and CarpeGuitarrem seem to have interpreted what I meant by \u201cMode X\u201d correctly.</blockquote>\nNice. I wasn't sure if the perspective I laid out were correct. What I think is most interesting is that a die roll is considered to be part of the setting.

What I'm thinking of is something like this.<br/><br/>So the players go into an area that you've already designated as "place where dragons like to chill out". Like, you marked it off on the map or whatever, but you never really prepped much data on it. For the sake of the thought experiment, let's say that there's no tables that explicitly address the presence of dragons in an area. (Perhaps this is a sort of thing that should be in such a game system--a generic table of sorts.)<br/><br/>So do you introduce a dragon into things, because it follows from the established fiction (this is where dragons chill out)? Or do you not, because  it's unfair to spring something when the rules didn't cover it?<br/><br/>If that explains it? Like, when it comes to purely fiction-grounded matters, the GM-as-arbiter becomes more important. The GM looks at the world as known, and then has to appropriately apply the mechanics.<br/><br/>So I guess in a broader sense...what I'm talking about is rules that don't precisely state when they're applied. Rather, the GM looks for what the players are doing in the world/story, and makes a judgement call on when to apply rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437274/#Comment_437274" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T12:36:35+00:00" title="August 14, 2014 12:36PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It\u2019s a grey area for sure.

More things are in the booklet than on the index cards. Showing things from it, which I do constantly in just the way you describe, always risks them glancing at stuff that hasn\u2019t come up yet.<br/>\u2022 The players are <em>very</em> new and the time allowed for our session have been short. I don\u2019t want to overwhelm them. I show them things often to build trust but I don\u2019t show them everything. Sometimes they\u2019ve asked to see something (which is a habit that\u2019s perfectly suited for my goal) and then I\u2019ve shown them.<br/>\u2022 My native language isn\u2019t English, but some of the players only speak English and we play in English. The current booklet is in English, so that\u2019s covered. However, I also have to write the index cards in English. I\u2019ve made a few mistakes here and there, many cards have the first few words in my native tongue and then switch to English. This is the smallest problem because there are some other bilingual players at the table that can verify it independently. I\u2019ve also been considering some older non\u2013English-language modules to run later and the same solution can apply.<br/>\u2022 I know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenomelin" rel="nofollow">a form of shorthand</a> that they don\u2019t know. Which means I have to write out everything in longhand which is annoying. It\u2019s not all bad \u2014 I write shorthand a lot faster but I <em>read</em> longhand a lot faster, and both quick reading and quick writing are important in this context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437285/#Comment_437285" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T13:15:26+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  1:15PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here\u2019s another future potential snag:<br/>\u2022 I have geomorph tiles that I\u2019ve been wanting to use in prep: decide on a layout, write up the layout on one \u201cmeta card\u201d, and then clip the tiles to index cards writing the stocking on the card itself (as well as to which tiles the exits lead so I don\u2019t have to look at the meta card all the time).
