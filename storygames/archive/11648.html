Seeing his pictures and hearing his descriptions of the museum's slavery exhibit gave me a gaming brainstorm; why not have a trip to the museum followed by lunch ordinner and a game of Steal Away Jordan? Either myself or my boyfriend Matt (deliverator on these boards) will take up the GMing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs anyone else a) interested in this idea and b) free sometime during this weekend? Matt and I can be somewhat flexible in our timing, though we're restricted by whatever the public transit schedules from greater DC look like. If not this weekend, are there any other interested people who'd like to propose a different day?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this were gonna happen, I'd also need someone who lives closer to/knows more about Baltimore to either suggest a coffee shop/restaurant/other public venue to game in, or volunteer their house. Much as I'd like to drag everyone back to my place in DC, that's probably not the most efficient plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nLemme know if you want in!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnna                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260183/#Comment_260183" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T07:48:16+00:00" title="March  5, 2010  7:48AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing Steal Away Jordan in public makes me very nervous. I would hope that people would "get" what we were doing, and that it was a healthy (and non-racist) thing, but I'm not sure that I could explain it before I got hit in the face.<br/><br/>My house is a good 30 minutes away from Baltimore by subway, with at least one transfer, I think. Can't be this weekend, but another weekend could be feasible. If there's a downtown museum involved, I would love to drive down and join you, and then I could give you a ride to my house and then back to the subway when things were over.<br/><br/>Gotta check with the wife, of course. There's a chance she doesn't want anyone to see our house in its current state, with hunks of sheetrock ripped from the ceiling where the ice water leaked in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260205/#Comment_260205" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T09:31:39+00:00" title="March  5, 2010  9:31AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Color me cautiously interested, myself.  I have to buy a new car (joy) before I'll risk driving into Baltimore again, but that should happen soon.  Maybe as early as the next month or so.  Not great timing for <i>this</i>, unfortunately.<br/><br/>Anyway, there's a possibility we could get some gaming in at Lenny's Deli on Lombard Street.  It's a nice, laid back place and the pastrami is freakin' awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shoggoth" title="Shoggoth"><img alt="Shoggoth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shoggoth">Shoggoth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260521/#Comment_260521" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-06T22:17:31+00:00" title="March  6, 2010 10:17PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have time this weekend, but I'd be interested in hitting the museum and playing Steal Away Jordan.  I've heard a good bit about the game, but never played it, so assuming that's OK I'd be interested sometime in the next couple of weeks.<br/><br/>I live in Catonsville, and I'd be happy to pick anyone up from a train station (BWI is very close to me) and drive them as needed.  My house is also available as a place to game.  I'm with Adam though, not too interested in playing SAJ anyplace where what we're doing could be misinterpreted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/songsaboutrainbows" title="songsaboutrainbows"><img alt="songsaboutrainbows" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/songsaboutrainbows">songsaboutrainbows</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260614/#Comment_260614" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-07T21:07:42+00:00" title="March  7, 2010  9:07PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nothing happened this weekend due to too-short notice, but I could be up for it on the weekend of March 20-21, or maybe the weekend of April 10-11.
