I made a little hack for playing Technoir in the Mass Effect setting. I think it would work well and tell a very different tale than Commander Shepard's, which is sorta the point to me. <br/><br/>I'm gonna do up a Citadel Transmission next. Thinking of adding in some familiar personalities like Commander Bailey, Dr. Michonne, and the Asari Consort. Any requests on who else to throw in there? Or Objects/Locations/Groups?<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cth1r7h6j72p0vf/Mass%20Effect%20Noir.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/cth1r7h6j72p0vf/Mass Effect Noir.pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo" title="Edmoo"><img alt="Edmoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo">Edmoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413499/#Comment_413499" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-04T03:35:10+00:00" title="May  4, 2013  3:35AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks really cool!<br/><br/>I've never played Technoir - and I can't really find a pitch.<br/>Mechanically, what's the game like?

You have illicit tech and the talent to use it. Time to go shake the city and see what falls out. You'll get hurt, sure, but what kind of pain will you deal out?<br/>Technoir is a roleplaying game. You play protagonists like cyber-tweaked couriers, hard-nosed investigators, and drugged-out hackers making opportunities for themselves in a despairing world. Using a rules-light system with enough intricacies to spark new fires of hardboiled crime novels and cyberpunk science fiction, Technoir lets you coax, hack, fight, prowl, and shoot your way through a dark future. It features Transmissions--city guides brimming with plot nodes to inspire your high-tech adventures--that the GM uses to create tangled and compelling plot webs that expand and evolve as the players' characters engage it."<br/><br/>So yeah, it's a cyber-punk noir style game akin to Blade Runner. Not exactly what Mass Effect is all about truly, but I figured this hack would allow someone to tell a unique style of story within the ME universe. There is all sorts of illicit tech in ME and a booming cybernetics industry which is a cornerstone of cyberpunk.<br/><br/>The game itself uses three types of d6's and is really stream-lined. Very small learning curve with a heavy narrative focus. It's all about applying "Adjectives" to people and objects. That's the only way the mechanics interact with the dice. If you want to do roll dice, you need to figure out which of your nine "Verbs" (sort of like skills, ie Coax, Hack, Move, Shoot) you're using, roll that number of d6's and take the highest number as your result. There are other dice you can roll as well called "Push Dice" which give you free dice to roll and apply long-term effects to your adjectives and "Hurt Dice" which represent how badly injured, physically or psychologically, you are and can hinder your roll.<br/><br/>Gaining hurt dice and failing at rolls is the only way to advance your character, which I think is really cool and says a lot about the system. So yeah, that's TechNoir in a nutshell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/makrdp" title="makrdp"><img alt="makrdp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/makrdp">makrdp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413633/#Comment_413633" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T13:23:27+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  1:23PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've written several Transmissions (Singapore, Hong Kong, 3 for Mechnoir, etc), so here are some lessons I've learned along the way:<br/><br/>Make sure your Connections with Shark and Splice especially - and Fix and Chop to a lesser extent - tie into your playbook's strongest elements. Those three favors come into play during character creation, so they're almost guaranteed to be involved from the start. Dividing Fix and Chop favors to only cover a couple categories can spread the love around a bit.<br/><br/>Figure out your core themes! There really isn't that much descriptive text in a transmission, and you don't get to determine the order players will hit that content, so all the core things you want to communicate need to be present in multiple categories. I'm talking more about things like "pollution" or "vast, ancient civilizations" than a particular group. <br/><br/>Make your Threats and Locations open to interpretation, and loosely tied to any one Faction; you should be able to use each element independently. Threats are especially useful for providing mechanical oomph to setting restrictions. For example, if drugs are illegal in Singapore, a police enforcement squad communicates that in a clearer and more meaningful way than a sentence in your opening three paragraphs.<br/><br/>I like to use Objects as macguffins, but also for ubiquitous objects to flesh the setting out and imply environmental hazards or cultural mores. Symbols of status or access are also handy.<br/><br/>Anyhow, hope that helps.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413640/#Comment_413640" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T15:52:09+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  3:52PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2013 3:52PM by Pheylorn.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mark,<br/><br/>I really appreciate the advice.

People tend to assume a particular gender for an NPC, and I usually follow their lead. The entertaining thing is that no two groups assume the same gender assignments for a given set of names! It's a useful bit of ambiguity, methinks, though I'm not sure how relevant it is for your project. Probably a good idea for the human connections, threats, etc at least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413665/#Comment_413665" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-07T07:21:16+00:00" title="May  7, 2013  7:21AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it!
