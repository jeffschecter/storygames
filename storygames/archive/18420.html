For the time being, using the Cart buttons to build up your order - and then copy/paste and submit via email. We will get back to you if we have run out of any stock, need clarification, or to give you a final total for your destination with postage and packing.<br/><br/>While we have tested the <b>Chalk Premium</b> ARU for washability - and it passed with flying colours - we haven't got the body fabric to complete these right now. We will accept pre-orders as a basis for determining how much fabric we will need. Fulfilment will take 2 - 3 weeks on these, based on current estimates.<br/><br/>If you picked up an All Rolled Up dice bag and game roll at <b>UK Games Expo</b> we'd love to hear from you, or see your review published online. Drop us a link if you post something.<br/><br/>Paul &amp; Fil<br/><a href="http://allrolledup.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://allrolledup.co.uk</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
