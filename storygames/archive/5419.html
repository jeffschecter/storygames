Then the crew would basically run them through an adventure while the rest of the audience watched.  It ran for a number of months in a little theater in Santa Monica called Magicopolis.

I am indeed a D&amp;D-head, so my outlook is going to be shaped by that background, but I'm eager to question my own thinking and assumptions.<br/><br/>Let's start a new thread and reap a fresh harvest of flames rather than pick up those reaped by the old one. Is there a way we could contact the OP and invite him to chime in here, though?<br/><br/>I think that a good place to start is looking at the assumption that the GM is the one who contributes all the fun. Let's break that down level by level, and I'll give my own perspective hoping other folks will share theirs.<br/><br/>At the table? When I DM a D&amp;D game, I'm conscious that I do most of the talking. I reason from this that my skill (or lack thereof) is going to be the biggest determinant over whether everyone has fun. But the other players certainly have power; one asshat can ruin everyone's day, and a convention game of random gamers is almost always less fun for everyone than one for my own group of players who have both mad skillz and shared history.<br/><br/>Prepping for the game? I encourage my players to invest time in the game, but I think it's still easily a 5:1 ratio of my time to theirs spent on the game away from the table. And that's *after* I handed most of the prep work to professionals (Nick Logue and the other good folks at Paizo who put together the Savage Tide adventure path).<br/><br/>Enabling the game? As a DM my contributions here are minor; I don't host, and committing to a regular play schedule definitely takes-a-village. I do think that this is one of the more important things a pro can offer, though. We see that most clearly with Becky Thomas's Roleplay Workshop here in the States and the Israeli examples I hear about. I don't doubt that Becky is a great GM - given the hours she works, she probably has more experience at running games than anyone on the planet. But what parents pay her for is first and foremost the infrastructural value she contributes; she provides a safe place for kids (vouched for by her teaching credentials) and an organized activity (which she's made a good case for being educational). For adults, I think the ultimate customer base might be people who fondly remember playing RPGs (which is largely going to mean D&amp;D) but who don't have the existing social infrastructure necessary to get a game together. <br/><br/>My Otherworld Excursions experience with organizing games for paying customers is limited to people who want to be part of a game that's run by someone whose RPG writing work they admire. (To date, those someones have been about a dozen people, and Ken Hite, respectively). The existence of that customer demand potentially represents a myth that a great GM is going to make a great gaming experience. It no doubt also partakes of some mythical celebrity stuff, and it's certainly a myth that everyone who can do good RPG writing can also run a good game. None of those dozen people asked for their money back, but a money-back guarantee is just a way to say "Gee, I'm sorry one of your fellow customers was an asshat who spoiled everyone's fun," not a way of keeping that from happening.<br/><br/>Would having a professional player as part of a paid gaming experience increase the chances of its being fun? What would it be like to be that player? Would that pro player alone be able to create enough demand to sell the game to people, or would it take a pro GM as well?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121596/#Comment_121596" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T17:31:31+00:00" title="January 23, 2008  5:31PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Tavis, <br/><br/>A couple of things.<br/><br/>There's a related discussion, which includes Becky, over at <a href="http://www.educationalroleplaying.net/" rel="nofollow">Educational Roleplaying</a>.  Might be worth a look.<br/><br/>I think you'll get a lot of push-back around here about stuff like the burden of GM prep and the responsibility of the GM for carrying the fun.  I'm not denying your experience, but there are other ways that are pretty effective at changing those equations in positive ways.  <br/><br/>I'd like to hear more about Otherworld Excursions as well!

I found the <a href="http://www.educationalroleplaying.net/comments.php?DiscussionID=13&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">Roleplay Workshop Interview Thread</a>, which is full of goodness. Are there other professionalism-related threads you were thinking of as well?<br/><br/>Re: pushback about GM power/responsibility, I figured I'd invite that right up front. My experience is definitely that of an antediluvian troglodyte who, from time to time, sticks his head out of his cave to see what all this newfangled flint-knapping is about. If there are ways to increase player authorship that would help a RPG service biz deliver a great gaming experience to paying customers, I'd love to hear about it. But I'm too old-fashioned to come up with those ways on my own, and I'm always going to appraise them in the light of how well they'd work in my particular cave.<br/><br/>One thing I think is true is that in this case especially, we are not the audience. A reality check for any techniques for assigning more responsibility to players is "would they be readily adopted by a cross-section of gamers you've met in other contexts that are play-to-pay to some degree, like convention games or the RPGA?" One of the interesting things <a href="http://ireallymeanit.blogspot.com/2004/11/tales-of-mercenary-gamer.html" rel="nofollow">jsimpson</a> has said about his pro-GM gig is that it meant giving up a lot of the power that he was used to having as a (traditional) GM. If his players wanted to do space opera, and have uber-powered characters, that's what he had to deliver; his own ideas about what styles of play produce the best fun didn't enter into it. <br/><br/>If you're playing for your own enjoyment, you have the power to game only with a group of people who are willing and able to share the responsibility for carrying the fun. Doing it professionally might mean giving up that freedom. Can you say the customer is always right and still deliver a fun experience? Are there enough potential customers that you could turn away those who seem like asshats, and how would you screen them out? These are open questions. And there's some reason to think that if people are paying you to GM they're going to have an expectation that they can sit back and be entertained. They may well be wrong - in order to make sure that they have an experience worth paying for, you may have to empower them - but if so, you might be working against their natural inclinations.<br/><br/>Another thing I think is true is that the market of paying customers for a RPG experience is going to be a small subset of the total population of roleplayers. That subset is going to be skewed towards people who are wealthier, but I don't know if it's going to affect their tastes. In other words, chances are that they're going to want a session of "the world's most popular RPG" (as the d20 euphemism used to have it) with all the traditional DM role that implies. I think that one way the OP went wrong in hanging up his pro-GM shingle is that he was advertising a relatively non-mainstream game experience, probably based on his own ideas of fun rather than the market's.<br/><br/>The behemoth3.com site used to have a testimonial from a guy whose wife had bought them both tickets to Ken's occult architecture tour/Call of Cthulu game as an anniversary present.

I get the sense that Wizards is going after this with their Dungeons &amp; Dragons Initiative online tools, which their PR claims will do much of that stuff for you. (You'd have to get a special hash and eggs attachment for your printer, though.) They're casting the monthly cost ($10 or so) as a subscription fee; folks often view it in the light of a MMORPG monthly fee, but I think it might be appropriate to think of it as more like a lawn-mowing service - taking care of a chore that crops up on a regular basis. I think that's a wise way to go. One of the problems with commercializing RPGs as goods is that you really only need to buy them once. As soon as the basic instructions on how to roleplay are out there, gamers can &amp; will take the ball from there and make up the rest on their own. Trying to sell us more instructions (rule books, supplements, adventures, etc) is kinda uphill. 90% of that stuff won't actually see use at the table; those books that will are going to get used over and over. It makes sense that gaming companies want to find a way to get paid over and over for the products that really are useful, and as a consumer I'd rather keep paying for ongoing support of the stuff that I do use - since the alternative way for publishers to get paid over &amp; over for the same material seems to be a steady turnover of new editions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's interesting to think about a gaming valet job in the light of the discussions in the earlier thread. One argument that emerged there seemed to be that yes, traditional GMing is a bunch of work (with the caveats that it's not the only way to skin a cat, and that even in the most traditional setting fun emerges from the group not the GM), but that the work is its own reward. I think that people who are attracted to the idea of being a pro GM - and I definitely implicate myself here - want both kinds of rewards. "Look at me, I'm a magic GM! All power and responsibility are mine! All fun flows from my fingertips! Want to know just how magic I am? <i>People are paying me to do this</i>!" The gaming valet job nicely separates the person who does the relatively un-fun work but gets paid from the person who is paying someone else to enhance their own ability to do the fun parts of GMing. The limitation is that only folks who already have a lot of gaming infrastructure (a committed group of players, a place &amp; a schedule for getting together, fluency with the game system) are going to be in the market for a gaming valet, and I think such active gamers are a relatively scarce compared to people who would be willing to pay to be involved in a game precisely because they don't have that infrastructure, or because what the pro GM is offering is clearly superior to what they can get together with their own resources. Still, active gamers tend to go to RPG websites and so it's much easier to reach them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121657/#Comment_121657" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T06:53:02+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  6:53AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2008 6:53AM by JDCorley.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The amount I'd be willing to pay varies considerably with - the quality of the food, do we get to keep our character minis, and so on.  <br><br>I don't know if it's a viable option, I'm not a market analyst, I may be an unfeeling monster but I'm not dead inside!

Let's say 15 bucks of cost involved in making something decent, nothing spectacular or super high quality, more of a "here's a neat little thing we give you to remember our day with us". Advertising the service on the base, or whatnot.  Costs 'em 15 bucks, they charge us 20 apiece?<br/><br/>Good sandwich makings cost a whole lot less in bulk than retail, but let's say they have to buy retail and end up at, say, five bucks a sandwich in cost. They charge us 10.<br/><br/>Working out a ton of stat blocks and maps and such is mainly typing and calculating and printing - clerical work. Let's call that a generous (for here, for piecemeal work) fifteen bucks an hour, it typically takes me, an experienced GM, half an hour or so to work up an hour's worth of monstar-fightinz, though once I get going it goes a lot faster.  So for a 12 hour session that would take six hours, six times fifteen is 90 bucks.<br/><br/>Most dinner takeout services charge about 20-25 percent here in Tucson, hard to translate that without knowing the number of players, but let's call dinner $60 for the food and $20 for the delivery/service.<br/><br/>So for a five person game, that's:<br/><br/>$100 (minis we get to keep)<br/>$50 (lunch)<br/>$80 (dinner)<br/>$90 (GM material prep)<br/>-----------<br/>$320<br/><br/>Divided five ways, that's $65 for a giant day of gaming with everything provided. That's about the same as a con, if you count your food expenses.<br/><br/>And there's a lot of ways to cut costs and/or prices in there, as you can see.<br/><br/>And if we don't keep our minis, that's a big chunk right there.<br/><br/>Anyway, I can see how those wedding planners make their money! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121681/#Comment_121681" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T09:23:30+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  9:23AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Planner duties?

I worked in dining and catering and have some clue about food costs and whatnot through my brother who still does that stuff as a kitchen manager at a five star hotel.<br/><br/>On a related note, someone on a minis yahoo group I've joined was tossing out a similar idea regarding renting out minis armies. Any of you folks who've priced out minis costs ( even before counting labor to get them looking pretty) probably has a pretty good idea of what that stuff costs. Actually renting might make a fair bit more sense. Value added stuff like you were talking about JD even bumps costs up further.<br/><br/>And, yes, there are ways to bring down costs significantly. It pretty much works the same way that it does for independant construction contractors/handyman types in terms of bids.<br/><br/>I suspect that the B&amp;B idea I mentioned above that some french fellas are trying out makes even more sense. I know of several B&amp;Bs that have advertised Murder Mystery weekend getaways, and that isn't really anything but a LARP by another name.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121718/#Comment_121718" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T12:00:42+00:00" title="January 24, 2008 12:00PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a Vampire LARP for about five years and I definitely know how it goes!

Like I say, when we do decide to, they're craft store projects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121720/#Comment_121720" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T12:05:35+00:00" title="January 24, 2008 12:05PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could see the whole thing working better as package deals of stuff you wouldn't normally do.

Thanks for your support, and I'd love to do something for Gamer Traveler about Otherworld Excursions someday. Although I am working on getting that going again, my focus at first is going to be recurring local events and conventions rather than unique travel events.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe great thing about the travel excursions is that they're so cool on the face of them; the extra value is self-evident, which helps get around the initial reaction of "no way in hell would I ever pay for a RPG experience." The problems I had were that it was tough to reach potential customers - the low-cost publicity resources I learned to use as a publisher are all global rather than local, and since I don't live in Chicago or the Pacific Northwest, it was hard to tap into resources for finding gamers that are specific to those areas. (We did get a number of people who were traveling cross-country or from Canada to do an excursion, either as the sole goal of a vacation or as part of a trip they were planning for other reasons, but I'd guess the majority of interest we got was from people who lived within 50 miles of the site). And then the other problem was that it was hard to grow to the point where we could cover a tiny niche's worth of a country-wide population of gamers. With just a few events on our slate, once we found a customer in Chicago, we had nothing else to sell them besides Ken's tour, and we had nothing to offer all the people who wrote in to say "That's a cool idea, I live in North Dakota, what do you have near me?"<br/>\n<br/>\nScheduling is also tricky - the catch 22 is that announcing a specific date makes it easier to get people interested, 'cause it's more concrete, but makes it harder to get any one of those people to come 'cause of all the individual scheduling conflicts. Something like Google Calendar might make it easier to get everyone to agree on a date - it wasn't around in 2004-5 when I was working on this - and if you have a local recurring thing like the original poster's, scheduling is easier than a unique event where some people will have to deal with plane tickets etc. well in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the other unsolved problem, of course, is the fact that finding the greatest GM in the world isn't a guarantee of a great experience for everyone, because the fact that someone has sufficient money &amp; interest to sign up for an excursion is no guarantee that it will be fun to participate in a game that has them in it. One thing I'd thought about was having paying customers fill less than the total number of slots for players. One or two of the remaining slots would be "ringers" - people recruited by the DM, probably from their own circle of friends so that they knew &amp; trusted them, to be players in the game &amp; help drive the quality contributed by that side of the group experience. They would be, in essence, professional players. And controversy tends to ensue when that idea enters the picture (although it often gets brought up as a hostile reaction to an existing controversy re: professional GMs).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122179/#Comment_122179" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-27T10:13:02+00:00" title="January 27, 2008 10:13AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't necessarily think the idea of ringers is a bad or dishonest one if everyone knows why they are there.

On the last one (the more successful financially) I made $1360 over the course of 12 weeks playing once a week.<br/><br/>Let me say... it was a LOT of work, and I decided that the concept holds a great deal of promise but there is no way that it was worth that little.  For every hour of play I spent at least six in prep, which amounted to every night of the week pretty much.   Of course part of what was a lot of work was that I was inventing the business as I went and had no tools to help me with it.  So I had to create the tools as I went.   By the end I did feel like the next time around it would be a lot easier, but I had other aspects of the project I wanted to work on, and got caught up with that, and so since 2004 when I ran the Hamfest Spring Campaign of 2004... I haven't done it again.  I'm not so sure how easy it would be to set up again, though I have some ideas about it.<br/><br/>Yes, I know, you want to know all my trade secrets and how I did it and all that.  Ha haha... um ok.  I'll fork it up.<br/><br/>I happen to be designing a computer program to help me GM my world.  I signed up with a local game club on yahoo groups to see if I could drum up play testers.   I saw a letter flit by:  "Wanted Gamesmaster... willing to pay."   I wrote her back and arranged to GM for her kids and their friends for the grand sum of $4/hour per kid.   There were 12 kids between the ages of 9 and 12.   Yes, it was a glorified babysitting service from the parents point of view.  And a fantastic play test from my point of view.  And from the kids point of view:  An increadibly fun experience!   The campaign was outrageously fun and creative and I just adored the time I spent with the kids.  They were *Awesome Role Players* and really fun little people!   No kidding.  But some of them had ... um ... issues ... with things like staying seated... not hitting other kids ... not playing as a team member ... and such.   Howver, over time I evolved methods to deal with these issues.   In the end I was super glad I did it, but ... wowowowow... it was a LOT of work.   I'm not sure it was worth it at that price point.   At $10/hour/kid?   Hmmmm... now we're talking ... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>Along the way I took copious notes about what worked and what failed and what my solutions were, and created useful spreadsheets to help out.   I plan to post my "tools set" with my game system (the computer program) which is kinda nearing completion.   Would you believe I'm looking for ... play testers?   If anyone is in the Westchester NY area and would like to play test my system ... I'd be mightly glad to hear from you!   <br/><br/><br/>- Mark<br/><br/><br/>PS - The first gig was also a blast and involved 35 sixth graders.  Also awesome.  Also had issues.
