I like that, but recently I've been willing to explore games where players don't control 100% of their characters. What do I mean?<br/>-a player runs his character guided by some kind of script: "-you're angry at Jason/you will be a dick with everybody today/etc.". Kind of like "darkest selves" in Monsterhearts.<br/>-a roll or a conflict may change your character's motivations, feelings or personality: "now you are not so sure about studying medicine/you don't love him anymore". The examples here might be some secrets in The Shadow of Yesterday that allow you to impose keys to other characters.<br/>-a character is temporarily controlled by other character, or other characters gain temporary rights to veto things you want to say about your character.<br/>-your character fails a roll and somebody else controls you or dictates your motivations for a brief time. I'd love to play a Sansa, or in general a character very easily manipulated and controlled by other people. I'd also include here strings in MH, and how do social conflicts work in Burning Wheel, where your character might have to do something he doesn't like, due to a failed roll.<br/>-a character "fights", mechanics-wise, against some part of himself, trying to change something about his personality.<br/><br/>Why do I want more of these things in games: I really want to run stories of people learning to choose their own path, at first being easily controlled by others, slowly growing and gaining autonomy. Or a story where a character fights against himself, trying to overcome his depression (just an example).<br/><br/>Are there other examples of games where this happens, or that are designed to fully supports this? My first choice would be BW, but there might be other games I'm not aware of.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438175/#Comment_438175" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-08T19:30:03+00:00" title="September  8, 2014  7:30PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2014 7:30PM by AsIf.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>a story where a character fights against himself, trying to overcome his depression (just an example).</blockquote>This may be applicable to the above; I wrote a Burnout mechanic for PbtA games,  You can find it here: <br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=6860.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=6860.0</a><br/><br/>The mechanic is intended for "actorly" players who are okay with getting external direction on their character's internal state.

Each player creates several memory cues, which are then drawn by the focus player, who reads it aloud. The other players each ask the focus player a question, which must be answered with a "Yes, and..." that form the basis for the scene the focus player narrates. However, when the player gets to a point in the narration in which their character has to make an important decision, they ask two other players what it was they did, and must choose one of them.<br/><br/>So, there's a certain amount of player character control, but what you can do (or rather, did do in the past) is limited by the group, in a sort of wonderful way where what you choose may be something you never would have thought of yourself.<br/><br/>It's brilliant, great for a one-shot game, and I highly recommend it. The text is also presented "in character" and quite a delight to read. Having facilitated it, I want to eventually prepare a digest version of the rules to present at the game table to cut down on mechanics explanation, but regardless every time I've played has been a delight.<br/><br/>Another mention for a GMed game, although not quite as strong, is The Clay That Woke. The resolution mechanics work in a way which in addition to determining if you failed/succeeded also determine how and what other consequences might arise. You have some input into how you want to succeed, but ultimately what happens depends on a random draw. Additionally, there's a major thing that happens if a particular stat changes too much, and if you get caught up in it, it may disrupt all your character's plans.<br/><br/>I'd also highly, highly recommend The Journey. Now, I place this at the end, because it's a freeform LARP/Jeepform-style game rather than a table game. It's about a small group of people in apocalyptic times, but it's far more Cormac McCarthy's The Road than Mad Max. It's dark and brutal. Each scene is predetermined by the text. Each player receives a sheaf of papers, which details what they attempt to achieve, do, or show during each scene. The players have a lot of freedom in how they present what they do, and must react to what the other players do, but their goal is defined within the text. This game has been one of my absolute best, most powerful, and most emotionally challenging gaming experiences.<br/><br/>AsIf, I quite like your Burnout rules! I really haven't played many PbtA games, and actually just played my first AW campaign not long ago, but those rules seem like they could be easily adapted to non-PbtA games with a focus on professional characters or work environments, or even a game that deals highly with relationship stress.<br/><br/>I really enjoy games of this sort and am also looking forward to other suggestions!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438184/#Comment_438184" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T02:38:02+00:00" title="September  9, 2014  2:38AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2014 2:39AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Why do I want more of these things in games: I really want to run stories of people learning to choose their own path, at first being easily controlled by others, slowly growing and gaining autonomy.

I love the distinction between player and character, because the player often has so much more writerly authority than the character does. Players might write backgrounds for their characters that say, "My paladin has a brother who has fallen to evil and my paladin wants to win him back from villainy." The paladin doesn't get to pick that ... but the character does. So the character is often just the hub of the player's influence, with spines reaching out into the rest of the game world.<br/><br/>And the game world can act back on the character in ways the player might like but the character might loathe. Similar dynamic, in reverse.<br/><br/>For specific examples, though, losing your character to the Dark Side in the original <i>Star Wars </i>game could have this effect if the GM ever gives the character back.<br/><br/>In <i>The One Ring, </i>characters get played briefly by the Loremaster when they go through a bout of Corruption, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438220/#Comment_438220" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T13:33:42+00:00" title="September  9, 2014  1:33PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>In <i>The One Ring, </i>characters get played briefly by the Loremaster when they go through a bout of Corruption, too.</blockquote>\nAs I recall, the "bout of madness" rules in Pendragon are roughly the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438222/#Comment_438222" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T14:17:53+00:00" title="September  9, 2014  2:17PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <b>Panty Explosion</b>, your best friend narrates the successful rolls and the enemy narrates the failed ones.
