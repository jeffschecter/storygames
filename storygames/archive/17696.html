Well designed systems can guide players to produce fiction that emulates genres or caters to certain themes.  What about GMs?  They too are players but often they are given a unique ways of interfacing with the game's mechanisms.  In what ways can games systems incentivize or reward GMs for taking certain actions more or less often?

If you don't create scenes which target the characters' goals, you either don't get tokens, lose the GM role, or both.

In the game I'm working on, <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2012/08/24/getting-there-in-time-rev-0-4-0/" rel="nofollow">Getting There in Time</a>, I wanted to give the GM an incentive for some behavior that I often inadvertently let slip through the cracks when I GM which is to provide rich and evocative detail during the game (left to my own devices I usually end up with bland and featureless locations and NPCs when I create them on they fly). I realized that in the game the common case would be that the GM wants a "happy" ending to the session as much as the players do, so the "reward" for doing the behavior I want to encourage in my game is that the mechanical difficulty of the obstacle that the characters have to overcome to resolve the story is higher if the GM isn't able to get enough detail into play before the "begin endgame" condition is triggered. I'm not 100% sure it works yet since I haven't seen anyone but me try to GM the game, but I think it has potential.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400821/#Comment_400821" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T10:28:08+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 10:28AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like it could work, Dan!

As the game progresses and the players level up, the constraints and conditions on the GM loosen up. Of course, you'll need a few other procedures/mechanics to keep the GM under control and different kind of rewards for both players and GM in both the cases they win or loose, to help both turn the tables on the next scene. <br/><br/>Yet the GMs win condition should never be to anihilate the players, but perhaps something different for every scene, decided randomly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400838/#Comment_400838" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T11:40:33+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 11:40AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Descent kind of has this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400839/#Comment_400839" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T11:40:39+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 11:40AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That could make for interesting play for the right group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400841/#Comment_400841" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T11:44:58+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 11:44AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well there is Burning Empires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein" title="Nifelhein"><img alt="Nifelhein" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/888/nUG22UPKX7MJD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein">Nifelhein</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400848/#Comment_400848" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T12:38:05+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 12:38PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.

You can't really do this with individual NPCs (because you need to be prepared for the possibility that they get killed), but perhaps there is a way to do it with elements of setting. <br/><br/>I suppose Apocalypse World has this to some extent with countdown clocks for fronts, but that doesn't have the same feeling of customization as you go that you get as a player when it's time to choose a new move.

Anyway, my idea was to give the GM only the basic guidelines needed to frame simple scenes, and as the players get over the obstacles the GM put in front of them, she gets more and more possibilities unlocked for framing scenes with different moods/higher levels of difficulty. Of course, this was a bit more oriented to teaching how to GM.<br/><br/>I'd say there must be a way to allow the GM to use story points/aiki chits in the same way players do, and even in more GMing related ways. Boosting an NPC to make it last longer in what could otherwise be a way too short encounter, or to spend it to have that NPC escape could be a good option. Since these are used to allow players to protect their input to the fiction, why don't let the GM do the same? At least this should help to make it look fair in front of the players, instead of being just an injustifiable GM fiat (Well the GM should still have a really good in-fiction excuse for doing such thing)<br/><br/>It's not that GM fiat is bad per se and I know that more experienced GMs will probably feel a bit constrained, at lest in the beginning; but this is also meant to challenge the GM to do her best with less pieces, something that has the strange side effect of boosting creativity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402550/#Comment_402550" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-02T21:09:12+00:00" title="January  2, 2013  9:09PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2013 9:12PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One suggestion that I got was to rotate the GM for every session (as TBZ is structured for episodic play anyway - one session, one closed adventure) and have the previous GM convert their previous-session-GM-received-Aiki to new-session-character-Kiai at the start of the new session as a small bonus for their character.</blockquote>That is neat!  If ya can't reward good GMing in GM terms, then reward it in player terms, I guess.<br/><br/>I actually should mention my own mechanic here from <i>Within My Clutches</i>, where if you get "good GMing" fanmail, you use it to direct the spotlight, and pick which character gets to show us their Master Plan next (the GM can't otherwise do that, as play just goes in clockwise turns).<br/><br/>Still, neither of these have a truly motivating GM objective.<br/><br/>WarriorMonk, your idea sounds like the Burning Empires approach, right?

Here I think the same thing - the GM needs to (be directed) to work out some sort of world goal (perhaps through a PC or PC's of his own in the setting, even), to make his play more intermeshed into the fiction that getting to play with this monster or that monster would be. Like the players, he'd need to have a care about the world.<br/><br/>The final part is delinating between playing for the win (ala a gamist inclination) Vs more like a musical jam session where you work with the vibe of the current music and intertwine efforts in it or try and lead it to new places (without breaking the jam). Since were dealing with numbers, they tend to trigger the logical part of the mind more than the creative side, which tends to trigger the gamist reflex. One has to think of numbers like strings on a guitar, or like a palette of colours, then the creative side starts to glom onto them as a means of creative expression rather than purely for gamism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403570/#Comment_403570" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-12T17:05:59+00:00" title="January 12, 2013  5:05PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't know who it actually acts to motivate, GM or players, but I like to use:<br/><br/><i>If you bring me miniatures and/or terrain, I will use it to make parts of the upcoming sessions.

Not that it's described as such in play, instead the group describes it as 'how the world works'.

It's been done. While the nuances of restriction, all the interesting ways the different restrictions can be formed, are engaging. You can always go back to a carte blanche game anyway (and never mind that as GM you have everything is basically a myth - try dropping ancient dragons on a first level party over and over. It wont work out and in as much, you are <i>restricted </i>from doing that - supposed carte blanche games are really full of restrictions. They are just invisible.)<br/><br/>It depends. Not all GM's are going to find that less is more. But I think probably the ones who try out new systems probably will. And the ones who don't try out new systems - well, they weren't going to play your game anyway!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403766/#Comment_403766" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T16:28:13+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  4:28PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2013 4:34PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Without that adversarial role, I think traditionally the GM doesn't so much explore the fictional space, but simply muses on whatever he feels might happen next in the world</blockquote>\nThat definitely happens, but I think other options are also viable.  GM + players as a team vs system-imposed obstacles, for example.  I think you're right in that this won't necessarily lead to GMs <i>exploring</i> the way players do, but I suspect there's still fun to be had.<br/><br/>Example:<br/>We already have games where the system tells the GM an outcome <i>range</i> ("A roll of 10+ means the monster gets the character into a tight spot") but then the GM resolves it into a <i>specific</i> narration ("The monster forces you away from your comrades, and unless they do something to stop it, you'll be fighting it 1-on-1!").  So having the system (dice or otherwise) jump up and throw a <i>range</i> at you -- well, that's still exploration, somewhat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403770/#Comment_403770" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T18:04:03+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  6:04PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think if the 10+ presents two or more monsters to choose from (or a mix of monsters or conflicts, eg swamp monster or ex girl friend shows up. Player: "Please be swamp monster, please be swamp monster..." lol!) that entwines the exploration with the fiction, as what comes next (between the two choices) is based on prior fiction. Ie, exploring what comes next from the fiction, as in which of the two choices it results in. (stated explicitly, the GM bases his choice, to some largish degree, on what he thinks the prior fiction would lead to, between the two choices). Perhaps higher rolls lead to three or more options.

However, a player who advances the "manipulate" move can make an NPC into an ally: a friend, no longer a threat.<br/><br/>Surely, when that happens, it feels like a reward for the MC just as much as does for the player?<br/><br/>If I'm MCing, I'd be rooting for that to happen, that's for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404029/#Comment_404029" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-19T01:09:24+00:00" title="January 19, 2013  1:09AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2013 1:10AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a weird thing about "like my stuff!" for the GM:<br/><br/>- On the one hand, it's a huge reward when it happens, and it's a great motivator -- "I came up with a cool thing I want to share!" is probably what inspires me most to GM.<br/><br/>- On the other hand, every GM ever is already trying this and they don't need us to tell them to pursue it.<br/><br/>Re: the AW advance, I don't think making it <i>official</i> that a player can want to see more of an NPC really changes anything on <i>that</i> front.<br/><br/>I think the best tools a GM could be given for "like my stuff" are:<br/>- diagnosing what the players will like (thought it may be hard to beat "play with them and get to know them")<br/>- helping you effectively <i>present</i> the stuff <i>you</i> like<br/><br/>Especially that latter.  "Someone knocks out the PCs and takes them to the place I want them to be and shows them the stuff I want them to see," needs to give way to more advanced tactics of hooking curiosity and building up to reveals.<br/><br/>At the moment, that seems hard to me.
