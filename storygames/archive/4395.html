It was the feeling that the world we were exploring was a real thing, with existance outside the game.  It's similar to the sense you get reading LotR, that the setting is bigger than the story taking place in it.  <br/><br/>Problem is, in actual play, there are a large number of pitfalls to this style of play.  For a start, it seems predicated on an illusion.  The illusion is that what you encounter in the game is what has been there all along, rather than what has been made up just in time.  Often this is straight-up illusionism.  The GM tells you it was there all along, but really you were meant to go somewhere else, and now everything's been switched around so your decision doesn't matter.   You <i>think</i> you're exploring, but really you're being shown.  Other times, the illusion is more subtle.  It's left to a GM to 'interpret' the known facts about the game world.  Not only is this immensely draining for GMs, who have to come up with interesting situations no matter where the PCs go, it often shatters the feeling of exploration (the city guard get more powerful as the characters increase in level, dragons menace townships just as the PCs turn up, ships break down just close to abandoned space stations).  Another problem for this model is that usually, the GM doesn't get to do any exploration at all.  For the GM, the game's illusion is non-existant.<br/><br/>Traveller got me thinking about this because I thought the random world generation charts were actually a really interesting way of handling it.  Rather than leaving it all up to GM fiat, the GM got to interpret these random rolls and turn it into a coherant whole.  The GM got to be involved in the exploration.  Oddly however, the exploration the GM did was often solitary, during prep for a game.  Also, the planet generation charts didn't often solve the "interesting situation" problem I described above.  <br/><br/>Another model adopted by a lot of games is to release endless setting books, detailing everything minutely.  The GMs role is to act as conduit between these books and the players.  This removes the burden of the GM having to invent interesting things and pretend like they've been there all along, but it raises a whole new host of problems.  The GM's now required to have an encyclopeadic grasp of the setting, to know these books backwards and forwards, and be able to turn abstract setting information into exciting adventures.  It's also expensive as all hell.<br/><br/>Something I've been thinking a lot about recently is how to get that "Go anywhere, do anything" feel, without resorting to the kind of illusionism found in some games.  One thing I really like is the idea of "playing hard" - that all the players should be playing their roles to the full, throwing everything they've got into achieving their goal,  be that success for their character, adversity for the protagonists, or whatever.  Unlimited GM power, which seems to be a requirement of the type of play I'm talking about (at least as far as it's been seen in current designs), precludes this.  Unlimited GM power puts responsibility for the fun of the game in the hands of one player more than the others.  <br/><br/>So.  How do I achieve this? Are they opposite ends of the spectrum? Does this kind of exploration require an all powerful GM to model the universe, or can it be achieved some other way? How do you create the sense that the characters are kicking around as free agents in a universe that exists without them, without all the pitfalls it seemingly creates?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude" title="Consonant Dude"><img alt="Consonant Dude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/6858/fhjfhffblack2iv7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude">Consonant Dude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99155/#Comment_99155" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T02:10:02+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  2:10AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello Simon!<br/><br/>I've done a great deal of exploration. Probably 20 years of it.  It fascinated me. I haven't done that at all for a while now but I can talk about it, as well as offer the perspective of friends who are still doing it. Before I get to the main question, I'm going to offer my point of view on some of the issues you raise in your post. Hopefully, it will be helpful and relevant.<br/><br/><b>re: illusionism</b><br/><br/>I'll be short with this one, as I seem to remember it was contentious a while back. All roleplaying games are about pretending. Be they about exploration, or taking the role of an immortal in a player-empowered game. This is very much open for debate and the least helpful bit of this post I'm afraid. But I had to say it.<br/><br/><b>re: Being draining for the GM</b><br/><br/>I can very much attest that it can be so. Here's the key. You gotta make sure as a GM that you are 100%... no scratch that 1000000% invested and motivated by this. It is important that players buy into exploration. It is incredibly more important<i> that the GM </i>buy into his "God role" of overseeing the world. <br/><br/>Over a decade ago, I was asked by "explorators" to run a Forgotten Realms campaigns. I had several supplements that I mined for the odd idea and kept for pretty pictures and maps. I regrettably agreed to their request. Turns out I'm not really into FR. I was bored to death and it felt like work in prep. Pretty soon it became taxing in play, as I wasn't familiar with the material. It came to a point where players were more familiar with the material I had introduced myself than I was. The campaign came to a halt eventually. I couldn't continue anymore.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I <b>love </b>the homebrewed fantasy world I created. I've got tons of maps for it, tons of NPCs I care about. Dozens of PCs have explored it. I love the holidays, traditions I have created. I care about it. And thus, it was never a problem for me to prep and never felt like a burden.  <br/><br/>I have a friend who runs exclusively his Greyhawk campaign and a CoC campaign. He started the Greyhawk thing when he was 17 and it's still going 19 years later. With intricate timelines, poster maps and stuff. Everything else he has tried, he just doesn't feel invested. He collects all things Greyhawk and is happy that way. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Something I've been thinking a lot about recently is how to get that "Go anywhere, do anything" feel, without resorting to the kind of illusionism found in some games.

The first thing is to take explorationism for what it is. It's still just an aspect of gaming. You might want it to be the star but there will still be other supporting elements. Don't fall into the trap of thinking the GM or players will feel rewarded exclusively by exploration. And thus, don't get down whenever a situation arise and you need to create facts, make things up. Gaming is never one-dimensional, ever. Stories take place in worlds, stories have characters and stories have plots. And things need to be interesting. <br/><br/>Secondly, make sure whoever is the GM cares (see above).<br/><br/>Third, make sure the world is engrossing enough for these guys to just explore. You know as a GM that your exploration campaign works when you can sit down with *no plot hook* whatsoever and just let the PC buy stuff, go see their friends and interact with whoever/whatever they want. <br/><br/>Fourth, build upon the interests of the players as well as their characters. Let the players become "world builders" through their characters. This ensures that it doesn't violate their immersion. The characters will make friends, perhaps have families, start guilds or mercenary companies, write laws or poems. This will greatly facilitate your work (provided your system is coherently pushing things the right way. System will matter greatly).<br/><br/>Finally, it goes without saying that whenever you have to introduce plot hooks, make them "floating hooks: without violating sense of exploration. It's not an adventure "about going in Dungeon X or crashing on planet Z". It's an adventure about "Remember 5 games ago, when you messed with some guy in a spaceport bar? Turns out he's a pirateship captain and looks like the "Sun Skull" and a small float is right behind your ship". Then see what happens with the adventurers and use the backdrop as flavor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99156/#Comment_99156" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T02:47:46+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  2:47AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have always run campaigns that were set in very detailed worlds, worlds where there were many places to go (as opposed to go anywhere) but which were still the setting for traditional adventures.<br/><br/>A number of years back a long running campaign in one of those worlds came to an end (after about 5 years) and left me with a wealth of background material. I had map, notes on twenty different towns and villages, lists of hundreds of NPCs who had been encountered or mentioned, an encyclopedia (literally, in a ring binder) of saints, temples, festivals, trade goods, holidays, artwork, character drawings ... far more than a moderate collection of splat books. The capital city was especially well detailed.<br/><br/>So as a followup to the big heroic adventure that I'd run before I decided to do a followup campaign of down on their luck street thieves in the captial city's slums, and do it as a go anywhere, do anything game. After an initial traditional scenario to get the characters together I started keeping a massive folder of plot threads, interesting things about places and people. When the PC's encountered a new character I'd add a 1 paragraph adventure to the list, same when a new place was mentioned. If they decided to follow that person up, or to go to that place there was something there already, and if they seemed interested in that line of plot I'd add more, mapping it ahead of them but in a way like a big branching tree where they could abandon any line of story at any time and find an equally interesting line anywhere they'd ever been (or heard of).<br/><br/>Many of those little seeds and hooks never got used, of course, but they were usually only a paragraph or so long so it didn't matter much. I'd mark locations on my map as they were mentioned (rather than visited), which built up that existing world idea to even greater detail, and because I wrote the seeds when mentioned there were *really easy* or *really boring* things to visit sometimes, like going back to an early dungeon in a computer RPG.<br/><br/>I think the players really appreciated the lack of constraints, once they got used to the directionless feeling of having no plot pointers to drag them around (or having loads but without any railroaded preference), but there was always the danger that the story was bitty and without narrative thrust. I did my best to use all those little tricks of directionless foreshadowing (stuff happened that looked like foreshadowing, but I left the decision of *what* it was foreshadowing till later), picking up on irrelevant details in later stories to make them seem connected, adding new plots behind the scenes when player conspiracies made them sound plausible, and so on, but it could never have the grandeur of a bigger plotted campaign.<br/><br/>Oh and it was  a hell of a lot of work!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99158/#Comment_99158" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T03:08:46+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  3:08AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, from my own experience, exploration and creation can be fun. But as you say, they can be draining for the GM. <a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/astint.html" rel="nofollow">a|state</a> is a very traditional, exploration intensive game and one which I spent a lot of time GMing (and I should have, I wrote the damn thing!). It is very 'no limits', in that there are immense areas of The City that are blank slates, ready to be created and explored by GMs and players. Then again, with the game as written, very much like Traveller, it is beholden upon the GM to come up with the areas to be explored and discovered by the players.<br/><br/>How would I change this? I'd make the creation of the areas to be explored much more collaborative. Make that process of creation something that everyone does together. The GM can still add detail, antagonism and so forth, but the group as a whole can feel that they have created something worth exploring. My memories of Burning Empire are vague at this point, but I believe that the creation of worlds in BE might be a step towards what you are looking for? Would someone else with greater experience of BE care to comment on this?<br/><br/>One thing I would certainly encourage in 'go anywhere, do anything' games is the concrete ability for characters to affect the world around them, even if it is only on the small scale. This would, again, take some burden from the shoulders of the GM.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99159/#Comment_99159" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T03:27:22+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  3:27AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally agree Malcolm. With my open-ended campaign I had very detailed maps that showed every building in the city ... but they didn't say what the buildings were. I only marked in what they were when the players said "There has to be an X near here" (for some value of X - Inn, gambling den, brothel, safehouse, fence, ordinary worker's home etc.), or "I grew up around here and X is just down there somewhere", or "Do I know of an X in this area?" and so on.<br/><br/>It wasn't explicit control, in that I didn't say, here is a new area, you get to tell me what's in it, but an implicit one that I created things to match their expectations, took from their ideas and so forth.<br/><br/>Of course you are off exploring now, and experiencing *real* things that were there first.

What I want to hear about is specific mechanical approaches to this that might achieve the effect I want.  <br/><br/>Malcolm was hitting closest to the mark.  It's interesting to me, because on the face of it, you'd think that collaborative world creation would <i>reduce</i> rather than increase, the degree to which the players felt the world had an independant reality.  I'm not sure that's the case though.  I'd love to hear from anyone who's has experience with this kind of game (especially Burning Empires) to talk about that game in relation to these points.<br/><br/>Martin, in brief, here's my current thinking on illusion, as it relates to this idea:<br/>The sense that the world has an independant reality, and is bigger than the story = good illusion<br/>The belief that your characters are free agents in the world, when really their choices don't matter = bad illusion                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99338/#Comment_99338" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T15:55:03+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  3:55PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2007 3:55PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Obviously, I'm very interested in this subject.<br/><br/>Along the lines of Malcolm's post, I wrote this another Story-Games thread:\n<blockquote>Although later materials built out this huge simmy back story, the fact that the rules suggested the GM randomly generate worlds meant there was no big "clockwork setting"t that the GM had control of and would keep going no matter what the players did. <br/><br/>Let's say the PC are in a ship, they're cheating their fuel costs, and they have a misjump. (Remember that blast from the past, kids?)<br/><br/>So, they travel parsecs off course and end up in a new star system. The GM tosses some dice to find out where the heck they are.  He figures out what the main planet is like, tech-level and more. No color yet, just a string of digits that make you go... "Hmmmmm.... I wonder what's going on here."<br/><br/>Now, there's suddenly two ways of moving forward on this:<br/><br/>One is to stop play for a week as the GM comes back with 40 pages of notes, colored maps diving the planet into little areas of interest and so on... (And then freaking out if the players say, "Nah..." and start making their way back to civilization without so much a backward glance at the world the GM just created.)  This is sort of the "GM must be master of the of Sim world" way of handling it.<br/><br/>The other way is for [i]everyone[/i] to look at the numbers and go, "Okay, now what?"  This is more the Narrativism-[i]Primtime Adventures[/i] series creation-[i]Sorcerer &amp; Sword[/i] build the world as you go approach, where the GM isn't keeping everything secret, but everyone has input on the details so everyone is vested in what's going on.  Sure the GM will be making up MORE stuff... But using the randomly generated world details as a group exercise in  creative Narrative Juice just seems healthy.  (Frankly, I think taking Ron's comments from [i]Sorcery &amp; Sword[/i]'s world building section and mixing them with the [i]Traveller[/i] LBBs is vital to the [i]Traveller[/i] Awesomizing Process.)<br/><br/>For me the random world generation process acts as a sort of humbling stopgap for the GM -- "Dude, you're not going to be able to map 11,000 worlds -- and there's no point!" <br/><br/>It gets everyone closer on the shared distribution of Narrative authority.  It means we're all kind of in this together as we explore this strange thing called space. <br/><br/>(Caveat: again, I'm not saying the GM is always walking around blind. I'm saying, every world becomes a chance to slow things down and to pre-play work that is always helplful to Nar games.)</blockquote>\nNow, I've got some more thoughts on this, but in the interest of meeting Simon's needs, what is the focus you envision for the game.  That is, do the Players have Flags for their PCs?  Kickers?  Or is it pure <i>Traveller</i>: "Okay, you made PCs.... Go!" <br/><br/>Because in the first case the worlds can be grown out of the needs of the PCs.  It's my view that in this case the Players at the table are more "forgiving" (if that's the right word) for the details of the world, because they're point of the details is to serve the Flags of the PCs.  If the details are doing that, and the Players are focused on their PC's flags, all will usually be well.<br/><br/>But if it's, "Okay, this is about exploring one, detailed, rich world after another -- that <i>is</i> the point," that's going to open up a whole new kettle of techniques.<br/><br/>So, before moving forward, I'd love to hear more about that game you're envisioning.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99352/#Comment_99352" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T17:09:18+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  5:09PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Malcolm was hitting closest to the mark.

I'd love to hear from anyone who's has experience with this kind of game (especially Burning Empires) to talk about that game in relation to these points.</blockquote>\nThat assumption is very logical.  But, imagination is rarely logical.  Collaborative world creation actually helps against this because, instead of just the GM, all the players can help enforce what's already been established explicity, and here's the trick implicitly as well. They can make assumptions about some minor details and then make those a reality. Until someone says no, or it otherwise enters play, all the details their brain fills in is probably true. And if it never comes up in play, it's completely true.<br/><br/>But, the big thing that collaborative world creation brings in is authorship.  This goes against the grain when a lot of gamers seem to think, but world building opens up a avenue that authors have known of for a long time.  When you create something you build an attachment to it. It becomes alive.  The curse of authorship takes over and reinforces the desire to buy into the independant reality, reinforces the illusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99359/#Comment_99359" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T17:44:38+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  5:44PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            grumble<br/><br/>I had almost gotten over my urge to run "Return to Dunwich" and then you brought up the whole "the world that's already there" thing, and now I want to run "Return to Dunwich" again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99360/#Comment_99360" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T17:50:17+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  5:50PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Now, I've got some more thoughts on this, but in the interest of meeting Simon's needs, what is the focus you envision for the game.

Most set up a conflict or crisis, but had little description of how the resulting material would be played out. To me that is pretty much Sorceror's bandolier of bangs and some pre-built R-maps. The idea was that you simple pick something for this week's session and then mutate it for local conditions, customs etc. And of course you can pretty much write this yourself. Your players preferred campaign style: traders, mercenaries etc helped here as you had some idea of what would interest them. <br/><br/>At that point the local world starts to become color that you fill in to make that situation more interesting. I'd be tempted to intepret the UWP in light of whatever R-Map bangs I was considering tossing the players way this week, to make the situation more colorful and interesting. I'd tend to do this in pre-play prep though and rely on the players to see jumping as 'end of session'. Otherwise I think you are going to get some very homogenized worlds.<br/><br/>But I think a lot of suggested traveller play was improvisational in this way and lends itself to narrativist approaches.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99465/#Comment_99465" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T08:19:57+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  8:19AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you combine a chart approach with collaborative effort and a toolkit of specific options? I'm thinking about a history-focused tool here, sort of like what life paths are for characters.<br/><br/>So first you determine the basics of the planet, maybe randomly. Then you select, collaboratively, from a range of options how sentient life came to be on this planet. Did it evolve (from x/y/z) or was it colonized? The toolkit then has options to plug in things from other nearby systems. If it was colonized, pick a spacefaring group from somewhere close or make up a new one that explicitly came from a different direction.<br/><br/>Then play a couple of rounds through what developed on the system. Each time there's some randomizing factor, but also options for the group to figure out what makes the most sense or is the most interesting. This all keeps verisimilitude as well as player investment high.<br/><br/>So you pick the next historical stage as the development of democracy, or whatnot. Now you roll for what that meant--war, glorious days, civil unrest... and then together pick out a couple of details about it.<br/><br/>If I was designing such a system, the end result would be like a character from Burning Wheel: a planet with "history paths" that ends up with resource points to allocate, chosen from a limited range determined by the history paths, and with related stats that grew out of this, including tech level.<br/><br/>And definitely planetary instincts and beliefs. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

What I'm interested in is the illusion created (and you're quite right that it's an illusion) that the setting was a great big thing, seperate from the story.  For me, that's an incredibly rich experience, and something I really want to see in some of my gaming.  I think it was Ernest Hemingway or someone like that who said that an author should put only a tenth of what they know about the story onto the actual page.  The rest of that knowledge, lerking around the edges, is what makes the story feel alive.  I think that's particularly interesting if you look at the original Star Wars series.  All the history hinted at by the fact that this was episode 4, not episode one, all the fallout of the effects of the earlier, untold stories, made the movies' setting feel rich and detailed, even when it wasn't.  I think this is part of the reason why the new three movies fell so flat, and also seem to cheapen the old ones.  I wonder if there's a way to get that sense of an untold story in a collaboratively created RPG setting.<br/><br/>I've heard some really interesting things about Shock:'s world creation.  Can you tell me more? <br/><br/>Christian, what you're talking about sounds really cool, but I wonder how much of the information generated would be used? I guess it depends on the type of game being played.  Certainly for a Space Opera game like I'm imagining, it's more important to know what this organisation can throw at you <i>right now</i>, as opposed to the history behind it.

He wanted a dungeon-crawl type of game that was randomly generated, like Diablo, so it didn't require vast amounts of prep-work.. But as I recall, he didn't want it to be generated during play, for some reason. He wanted the dungeon to fully exist, so the players were exploring something that existed before they began. He also required, I believe, that it not place too much work on the DM.<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing suggested, other than having a computer design the dungeon for you, was able to meet all criteria. The important bits though were that it must pre-exist, and it must be unknown to the players, so as to have genuine exploration, for both characters and players. That is what makes it very difficult, I think. As an aspiring coder, I find myself thinking that the only way to make this doable without the GM having to do massive amounts of work ahead of time would be the charts route, but automated, with the results editable by the GM afterward; This may be the best option, though it obviously requires a coder willing to create the tool. I think it gives flexibility; The GM can quickly auto-generate various locations, perhaps setting certain criteria ahead of time, and edit them to better suit the story, or his own knowledge of the setting when it becomes apparent that the players will be headed that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other route is the My GM Herbie route; basically, have a GM who is so invested in GMing and so very kickass at making it all work out that even if he's not planned it ahead of time, he can make it seem as though he did. They exist, but not everyone can be that kind of GM; Not everyone has the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99825/#Comment_99825" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T14:07:41+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  2:07PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wolfe, how about cards?<br/><br/>Let's say you had a bunch of big square cards, each with a dungeon room/hallway/feature. You shuffle some predetermined number of them and start laying them out like that old Waterworks card game, attaching one entrance to another exit. Each card has a letter on it that corresponds to a page in the big dungeon generation book, telling you what's inside. So Room A could be A-1, the orcs' poker night room, A-2 the troll couch makeout room, A-3. the kobold student council room, etc. Then they get to room B and you turn to those options, either you could mix and match the options or the first time through you pick A-1, B-1, C-1, etc. and the second time through A-2, B-2, or whatnot.<br/><br/>It wouldn't go on forever, but you could buy another book for use with the same cards and get more options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
