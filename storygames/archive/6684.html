Usually the smaller games (&lt;=11 players) will have no reveals, but will have a role that can secretly learn the role of the dead, so there is at least one way for the group as a whole to find out the info. Larger games usually do reveal the roles of the dead because it can get very boring and tedious to lynch and kill repeatedly w/ no info over and over.<br/><br/>But it should be the moderator's job to state the roles, players should really never reveal their cards (since there could be some roles that are revealed as something other their true roles, ex. tinker)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148198/#Comment_148198" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T17:11:03+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  5:11PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ask this because the first time I played it, we didn't reveal cards.<br/>\nI recently bought a fancy version of it that mentioned something about revealing cards, and I wondered if I did something wrong?

I would have 2 wolves with 9 players, 1 wolf w/ &lt;=7. I also like to add in auxiliary evils that win with the wolves, but the wolves don;t know who they are (and usually the opposite as well) . The roles really need to be tailored to the group based on how they play and how complex they like their games.<br/><br/>_Simple 9er_<br/>2 Wolves<br/>1 Seer<br/>6 Villagers<br/><br/>The above is good to start with. The seer gets a view at night and a positive result if the choose a wolf. The village has just 2 chances to lynch a wolf, if they fail, the the wolves will win. Nice, quick and fairly tense, but it does lack a bit of the deductive element since the roles of the dead are not revealed. I find that this role set favors the evil side.<br/><br/>_Intermediate 9er_<br/>2 Wolves<br/>1 Sorcerer<br/>1 Seer<br/>1 Priest<br/>3 Villagers<br/><br/>The sorcerer is evil and wins if the wolves win. They do not know the wolves and the wolves do not know them. The sorcerer gets a view at night and a positive result if they choose the Seer. The priest learns the role of the killed players (or just the alignment). They either get lynch and night kill, or lynched only. If they get full role, the the moderator shows them the card for the dead players during the night phase.<br/><br/>_Advanced 9er_<br/>2 Wolves<br/>1 Sorcerer<br/>1 Cultist<br/>1 Seer<br/>1 Priest<br/>1 Hunter<br/>2 Villagers<br/><br/>Here we add another evil role called the Cultist that starts the game knowing who the wolves are, but they do not know who he is. And a good role called a parity hunter that is able to pull out a win for the village if they are left alive with a single wolf at the end of the game (which would normally be an evil win)<br/><br/>My current favorite advanced role set is for 13 players. We played this several times at a recent Con and it was well received<br/><br/>_Advanced 13er_<br/>2 Wolves (one of which is brutal)<br/>1 Sorcerer<br/>1 Cultist<br/>1 Seer<br/>1 Vigilante<br/>1 Martyr<br/>6 Villagers<br/><br/>The brutal wolf gets to choose another player to die with them when they are lynched. The vigilante gets to choose another player to die with them if they are lynched or killed in the night. The martyr *may* choose another player each night to protect and if that player is targeted for the night kill, the martyr dies instead. The Seer will get a positive result on ANY evil player they choose in the night (not just wolves like w/ a normal seer, but they would not know the difference between the evils roles)<br/><br/>It is a lot of fun changing the role sets on the fly to match the group of players at hand. This is very easy to do with small games like this which are over fairly quickly, but do provide a lot of game potential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175784/#Comment_175784" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-22T08:41:46+00:00" title="October 22, 2008  8:41AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to run it at cons, with groups of 15 or more, and we always reveal. I think no reveal heavily slants it to the wolves, because the lack of information means that they can't review previous debates and arguments, looking for who agreed with a now-lynched wolf (or, vice versa, who has happily argued to lynch villagers).<br/><br/>I suppose a smaller group might benefit from no reveal (haven't tried, frankly), but I am inclined to always play reveal for one simple reason: losing when you had sufficient knowledge is bad, sure; but losing while thinking that you never had near enough information to win is suck. As I demo this mostly for Looney Labs, to promote their (admittedly low-rent and overdue for improvement) game product, I don't ever want new players to walk away thinking that they never "got it" or never had a chance.<br/><br/>My 2\xa2....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175802/#Comment_175802" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-22T11:40:55+00:00" title="October 22, 2008 11:40AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, of course.
