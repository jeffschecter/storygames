Skip two more for relationship 2, and again two fro relationship 3.<br/><br/>So, faction A's relationships would look like this:<br/>1)A is rivals/enemies with C, but shares an important interest with them.<br/>2)A is allies with E, but there is a problem with the alliance.<br/>3)A wants a resource held by G but doesn't have what that faction wants.<br/><br/>Faction B's web then is:<br/>1)B is rivals/enemies with D, but shares an important interest with them.<br/>2)B is allies with F, but there is a problem with the alliance.<br/>3)B wants a resource held by A but doesn't have what that faction wants.<br/><br/>Like I said, kinda basic as a tool, but gives an easy, broadly useful tool to start with that should give some direction to interactions right away.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447855/#Comment_447855" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-10T17:01:04+00:00" title="August 10, 2015  5:01PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (That's nice, komradebob.

Each player has intra-faction goals, and each faction has larger goals that rely on resources individuals in the faction bring to bear that also force interaction with other factions. 6 factions of 3 players each, plus three small 1-person splinter groups. <br/><br/>The facilitator keeps track of time and makes sure everyone knows when something important happens, like a car bomb going off.

I'm still not truly sure how I want to work with time/turn on the player scale.\n<blockquote> Each player has intra-faction goals, and each faction has larger goals that rely on resources individuals in the faction bring to bear that also force interaction with other factions. 6 factions of 3 players each, plus three small 1-person splinter groups.</blockquote>\nI'm just beginning to poke at concepts, so I've been trying to start with small-but-expandable, depending upon how many players are actually present, and who shows up later or drops out during play.<br/><br/>That widget a couple of posts back was starting with 7 players+3 refs. Right now I'm thinking each faction has two characters to choose from. Pick one at the beginning of the game for your faction and get full blown stats, while the other becomes a useful henchman. If you have enough people, the second characters are also played and get full blown stats, but they are "booby trapped", in that even within factions there are differences of opinion or goals. And henchmen characters can get the upgrade if a main faction character drops dead/leaves scenario.<br/><br/>So, potentially up to 14 characters there.<br/><br/>After that, there are some wild card/rogue characters or factions lying around. Not part of the main circle of dead and mostly there for refs to use if things slow up, but could easily be bumped up to full character status, kind of like your splinter factions. Enough that Refs could easily spin them off.\n<blockquote>The facilitator keeps track of time and makes sure everyone knows when something important happens, like a car bomb going off.

I want to suss out the people who get into character portrayal whether they're winning or losing in-fiction, and who just generally add to the overall game play. The people who, well...<i>grok it</i>.<br/><br/>In particular, I'm looking for ways to identify those players who play supporting, comedic, and villainous characters well, because those people are gems and I'm going to want them for future games.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448003/#Comment_448003" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-17T16:43:31+00:00" title="August 17, 2015  4:43PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I'm feeling contrary, but why do you need a tool to identify fun players?
