While I have some ideas already, this morning I realized that I do not have a decent idea for all those stunts matrix operatives do. Of course all of them can be mapped to the standard harm-dealing moves AW already have, but what I need is some sort of distinction of how they are freaking cool against "sleepers". And when they go against someone their level - that's just goes up to eleven in awesomeness.<br/>\nLike, there is a very simple game named ThereIsNoSpoon, slightly risus-like, which says "roll 2 d6. first is usual die, second is green die. If you roll well with the first - you did it. With second - you did it 'while running up the wall', bending the rules. and if you hit with both - man, you're nearly as cool as Neo"<br/>\nSee? I want this very simple and easy distinction making it easy to describe the level of awesomeness that characters currently do.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: I'm talking mainly about cool battle moves as well as cool driving and maybe some other buffed-up mundane skills. Things like "stop bullets mid-air", "teleport" and other Neo-like craziness will be resolved differently<br/>\nNote 2: PCs are going to be on slightly lower power level then main cast of the Matrix(Trinity, Morpheus, etc), and getting there in a due time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I've got so far:<br/>\n- I have +Matrix stat, at least I'm fairly sure it'd stick, slightly similar to the +Weird in the original. It can be used to "look into the Matrix" thing, to barf forth smth, but for what else?<br/>\n- I'm fairly sure that Matrix can help with physical stuff (in AW that's mainly <i>go aggro</i> and <i>move under fire</i>). Talking is the thing you do for yourself, and sometimes we see how main cast suck at it(e.g. I see Neo pretty much stumbled when he encountered Persephone)<br/>\n- I think that usage of Matrix alone should not give you your victory - it should help you to get <i>something</i>, and/or help you to not get harmed in process<br/>\n- I bounced a few times the idea of <i>pay Matrix Point and get new options to the "go aggro" and "under fire" moves: Suffer No Harm and Take More Harm, But Get A Weak Hit</i> - like "you storm the lobby full of SWAT, you give them harm based on your roll, and you can spend M.P. to be so fast that you do not suffer any harm back in the initial exchange". It does not give you your win already, but you are unharmed and can continue to fight. Or go for an escape, if you see that you can't breach it here.<br/>\n- maybe "1 Matrix point: delay agent/negate their harm for one exchange. 2 matrix points: kill agent(who can still get to another body somewhere around, so be warned)". Or somehow else. It should be pretty damn hard to deal with Agents.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I still need very much:<br/>\n- I'm not sure, if I need some "spendable" resource, or a static thing characters have access to anytime. On one hand, I doubt Trinity(e.g.) would have problems with some copperhead anytime, exhausted or not(e.g. in the start of the first film she was obviously tired after jumping through this tiny window, but as much she was freaked out by the Agent, she wasn't giving a damn about cops, and Agent is, well, Agent). On the other hand, in the end of the same first film the more Neo fought Smith the more he was getting tired, and only his "Chosenness" shtick kept him up - until he clearly ate his bullet. So maybe Matrix Points should be spent with any mid-level opponents, but not <i>sleepers</i>. Another question is how hard it to replenish the resource - maybe just give them some of this Matrix Points at the start of each scene?<br/>\n- I'm not sure how detailed should be new options, and how much of them. Those two there look short and simple, but is it enough?<br/>\n- I think we'd need a couple of new moves built completely on Matrix, but no ideas for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp very much appreciated<br/>\n--Guns                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
