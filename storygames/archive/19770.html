The marked blocks could have themes, triggers, objects, whatever.<br/><br/>or you could mark the blocks with symbols or colors, maybe dots of color on one edge that may or may not be visible as the tower is built and gradually deconstructed. So you might know that pulling a block will trigger some effect, or it might come as a surprise.</blockquote>\nSo let's discuss that!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438630/#Comment_438630" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-23T10:43:18+00:00" title="September 23, 2014 10:43AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2014 4:34AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Imagine that a red dot somewhere on a Jenga plank means "pull this and then immediately pull another, sucker."

It worked pretty much exactly like that.  You pulled when you deal with stressful situations.  When the tower toppled over, your rage became too great, and you hulked out and destroyed things around you that you valued.  (There used to be a PDF online of the substantial rules adaptations to mesh Dread with White Wolf, but I can't find it any more.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438636/#Comment_438636" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-23T13:00:32+00:00" title="September 23, 2014  1:00PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You could easily have a skill system introduced, where different blocks are different colors, and your skill determines what colors you can draw.

If you make a pull and get a block aligned to the skill you're using, maybe you get an extra effect and can stop making pulls. But if the block is opposed to the skill, you have to make extra pulls from the tower.<br/><br/>And I don't think that memorizing blocks is too big of a problem, either.

That may or may not be a desirable feature.  (Sharpies on raw wood would have much less impact, I think.)<br/><br/>I also have a Tetris Jenga set sitting on our games shelf.  It has multi-colored blocks, some of which are shaped like Tetris pieces instead of simple rectangular prisms.  You could easily have special abilities key off of different colors or shapes in that.  (Since we first got it, I've wanted to run a science fiction trapped-in-a-computer-game techno-thriller along the lines of <i>Tron </i>or <i>The Matrix</i> using it for the tower.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>In many horror and thriller stories, there are two competing plot threads: surviving the danger and learning enough about the threat to finally escape/defeat it.  So if you're being haunted by a ghost, you have to figure out who they were in life, why you're being haunted and how to exorcise them for good.  Dread's Jenga tower addresses the danger but leaves the clues and mysteries to the GM basically.  You could mechanize that slightly by tying it in with certain blocks.  Perhaps some blocks have prewritten clues written on them, revealing pieces of the monster bit by bit.  (Or they have a mark that directs you to draw clues cards or something.)  Or if you're running a more improvisational game, the player who draws a blue marked block gets to invent a fact about the antagonist.  Either way, the players have to make draws until they have enough information to act.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438651/#Comment_438651" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-24T06:54:51+00:00" title="September 24, 2014  6:54AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2014 6:55AM by Paul88.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Collecting trigger blocks could also be saved for a end of game sequence .

The players took on roles within the Navidson family storyline. To tie in the meta-textual nature of the book, I placed specially seeded scraps of paper from an old copy of the book underneath the tower before building it. This meant that every time the tower was knocked over, players had a chance to read some more about the House, Zampano, Johnny Truant, etc. As the story progressed, I would seed more scraps with information about the Navidson family themselves--this did a pretty good job of freaking the players out.<br/><br/>In practice, it worked out well. Players seemed to relish knocking the tower over since that meant that a wealth of new information would come to light.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438663/#Comment_438663" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-24T13:58:01+00:00" title="September 24, 2014  1:58PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Stickers would change the experience of pulling a block slightly, </blockquote>\nA lot more than slightly, I think, since even small redistributions of weight from pulled blocks can make remaining individual blocks harder or easier to remove. When I stained my Jenga blocks black, it made them slightly stickier, which changed the feel of the tower a lot. Then I used lacquer on them to reverse the stickiness and it made them slightly more slippery than normal blocks and now my Jenga game is permanently stuck on super-hard mode.<br/><br/>If you can afford to ruin a set in playtesting, I'd recommend writing small symbols with a sharpie and then just blacking them out and writing a new symbol next to it when you decide to change them.

You might also have some interesting interactions between the three approaches and symbols. Maybe the magic approach treats some symbols as "super success" and other symbols as "become indebted", for instance. You could actually characterize the three approaches in different ways, then. You'd just use more generic symbols that referred to vague things.<br/><br/>Or maybe characters could have a "feat" that let them treat one symbol as another symbol. Like a Harry Dresden type of character would treat the "sacrifice someone else" symbol as a "become indebted to someone" symbol, maybe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438670/#Comment_438670" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-24T15:24:32+00:00" title="September 24, 2014  3:24PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all your thoughts!

If that risk also involved preparation, you get to keep the card the tile represents, which you can then spend later (I'm thinking very much Will Hindmarch's <i>Project: Dark</i>) to work toward completing the mission, or perhaps mitigate other risks. <br/><br/>It could work for a caper/heist sort of game. You need to draw tiles to prepare well enough to get the job done, but not too much lest you run out of time. Any mission should <i>hypothetically</i> be beatable without felling the tower, but when it drops, the heist goes sideways and the players have to use whatever resources they have to try to dig themselves out.<br/><br/>It might also work for a monster-of-the-week sort of game. Each draw represents the knowledge and resources that the players gain, but also the activities of the monster, so the players have to figure out how to defeat the baddy du jour before it wreaks too much havok. Should the tower fall, the monster accomplishes it's big bad agenda (e.g., opens the Hellmouth?), which creates new complications for the players to deal with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438678/#Comment_438678" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-25T02:06:05+00:00" title="September 25, 2014  2:06AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking about playing with the relationship between the tower and time.<br/><br/>Of course, the simplest way to play with time is the have a running total. You aren't timed on individual plays and instead difficulty is the number of pulls you make or what-have-you. But when the clock (only on during pulls, not during free-play) runs all the way down? Times up. You didn't get to the bomb in time. The target is in a secure location. The drop-ship left without you. You're playing against the tower, but you're also playing against the clock.<br/><br/>But let's say you have a heist or hacking game.<br/> <br/>The idea isn't quite fully formed yet and I'm not sure it work as a core mechanic (too much stress and too much fiddliness?), but as an important subsystem covering certain kinds of plays it could be really cool.<br/><br/>3 draws is a success. <br/><br/>Draw 1 block and you can back out; you didn't commit fully. You can redirect and try something else. You start crawling into the vent, but you realize it's going to be louder than you thought.<br/><br/>Draw a second block and you're in there and it's tough and if you don't pull through you're in trouble.<br/><br/>Draw the third block and you're through. Whew. That was a close one.<br/><br/>Draw extra blocks? You kept your cool and watch your six. You're cautious and prepared. You can keep them and spend them later for advantage.<br/><br/>Difficulty determines how much time you get. There are a couple of ways to do this. Time can be literal time. Someone has a stopwatch. 45 seconds? 25 seconds? 15 Seconds? Time can also be how many times you can open your eyes; pulls are blind and one-handed; when your eyes are open you stop moving and your hand isn't touching a block. Time could be how many smooth, continuous, pacy movements you can make or how many times you can shift your grip. I'm not sure what the best way to do it is but I really like the idea of using actual time.<br/><br/>One other way to make using actual time interesting would be to take an Ocean's 11 approach to the game. You start the game planning in free-play. Ask-and-answer. Hit something the players don't know? They can do recon with some sort of resolution system to structure play. Parallel to that, the plan is being made. The plan is constructed in action cascades. This is like the voice-over plan in Ocean's 11. "Ok. So here's the deal. 5:05, Robbie and I go in as the high rollers and make our way straight to the reservations desk, no nonsense. Meanwhile ..." You can make a certain number of what-if contingencies to build some spring into your plan, make preparations that allow you to interject during the second phase of the game and change course a bit ... and when you're ready, you start (break readiness down into phases (either with flashbacks or a new planning phase depending on what makes more sense); you don't do the whole heist in one go ... but you could also, I suppose, have timed sections of the plan, too; finish all of those actions in XXX seconds and then move on to finishing these actions in XXX seconds). You have pulls associated with the various stages of the plan. While pulls are being made, the timer is running. <br/><br/>That's sort of the gist of it. Marks and such on the blocks and/or interaction with the alluded adjacent resolution system could throw a wrench into things. Things you didn't plan for require new resolution with the alluded-to system from the recon/planning stage and can sometimes add to the pulls you need certain characters to perform; symbols on the blocks can cause additional effects--changing the way the blocks can be spent toward resolving the plan or modifying the way the next pull is made. There ought to be something that forces players to move things around and do triage with respect to keeping their plan moving along. Anyway, not sure how to make it work properly. It sounds like a hard thing to make functional but it also sounds really cool.

Each one represents the interest of a specific faction in the given situation or scenario. Maybe a deadly duel between the Queen's champion and the foreign prince is taking place, and the local Assassins' Guild has a vested interest in it turning out a certain way, so they get a tower. But the Queen has also rigged the duel somehow, so she gets another tower. And the fates are taking a side, so they get a third tower.<br/><br/>Each faction would be prepared kind of like a Front in Apocalypse World: it has certain goals and certain steps it will take along the way to becoming more powerful and creating some kind of dark future.<br/><br/>As players, sometimes you might know which towers correspond to which factions (perhaps certain abilities allow you to find out), and sometimes you will not.<br/><br/>Each tower corresponds to a certain twist in the outcome of the scene. Kind of like Otherkind dice, or a similar game, each tower falling corresponds to a specific danger. If the tower falls, you advance that faction's Front, and put into play some nasty business. (To continue the example, perhaps the Assassins' Guild has a plan to assassinate the King's newborn son during the duel. If their tower falls, that's what happens. The players may know this is a danger beforehand, or only find out afterwards, depending on how well-informed they are.)<br/><br/>Of course, the players must pull from the towers to succeed in whatever their goal is in the scene. Maybe they use the blocks for some kind of resolution process, maybe it's a less obvious link, like in Dread, where certain fictional moves require a pull.<br/><br/>Could be interesting in a game where there are powerful and far-reaching factions within the setting, all with different interests.<br/><br/>And maybe the players can create a new danger by putting something they care about at stake, which adds another tower to the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438690/#Comment_438690" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-25T08:31:47+00:00" title="September 25, 2014  8:31AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2014 8:33AM by Paul88.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure I have seen some where an idea for multiple towers based on the film inception ?

This is an alternate end condition that is not a collapse, and it would be interesting to see it put to use as a kind of goal for players. <br/><br/>For example: a tower crawl where the goal is to get to the top. If you can "beat" Jenga, the narrative ends in success. <br/>In another game, it might trigger some very positive effect for all players before resetting the tower. <br/><br/>To clarify: Illegal pulls are pulls at or above the highest completed level. Impossible pulls are pulls from a level that either has a single block in the middle with both edge blocks removed, or two edge blocks with the center block removed. My house rule is that if you can get the tower to a place where there are no legal or possible pulls, everybody wins.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439337/#Comment_439337" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-11T17:18:11+00:00" title="October 11, 2014  5:18PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That whole make your own little disposable tower to power shit is a pretty cool idea williamj35.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/williamj35" title="williamj35"><img alt="williamj35" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/williamj35">williamj35</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439338/#Comment_439338" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-11T18:44:40+00:00" title="October 11, 2014  6:44PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The inspiration came from my daughter.
