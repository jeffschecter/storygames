<p>I'm thinking back to my DitV game. It's not surprising that there was lots of pushing on my part, to positive effect. Lots of players had characters with some very strong views on the Faith, and by pushing hard at them with the desires of the sinful, it really gave them a chance to show everybody (including me, and including themselves) what their character was all about.</p>
<p>There was a great conflict in particular where Prestor, this grave, willful Dog (who bound some Demons to him on the side) walked into the room of this even more willful grandmother matron figure from the Old Country, who had never really accepted the Faith. It was funny that in-character, this was someone politely conversation, and yet out-of-character it felt quite nearly like an apocolyptic "boss battle", given all the Will dice she had! But it was a good Push, allowing Prestor to push back and show how serious he was about converting others to his beliefs.</p>
<p>Most of my attempts at engaging the players further were in the form of pushes, and in retrospect, I can see some points where pure pushes were <em>not</em> as effecting at getting what I wanted, engagement. A lot of times, I found it harder to get the character Gertrude (and her player) to push back at me. For example, I tried at one point to have one NPC interrupt her dialogue with "look, I'm not going to accept this from you, and you're going to have to leave", hoping she would take this opportunity to force this into a conflict. However, she chose to let it go, had one last word, and stepped out voluntarily. While this was just fine for the fiction of it, I felt like I wasn't doing quite enough as the GM to keep engaging her.</p>
<p>So what I'm realizing now is that there were some times that pull-ish methods <em>maybe</em> could have been better. I'll have to try to find out, of course. However, I can think of one or two times were I basically exhibited a weak pull (almost by accident) and got an interesting response. For example, at one point I asked each Dog to pick an NPC to have with them for a tense standoff conflict where each character had to hold off an incoming attack; from the pool of NPCs, Gertrude chose voluntarily to pick out a strong, defiant wife of the Preacher (who was in fact the same quarrelling NPC above, and who had even just before been the seed of the town's trouble). This was great; it was a chance for her to immediately say who she trusted to keep her safe in the heat of a battle.</p>
<p>But this is honestly mostly a guess, since we're no longer playing that game just now. It's still interesting me, as I'm seeing other ways to engage with the other players at my table. Next time me and that player are at the table, I'm going to see if I can turn that into AP results.</p>
