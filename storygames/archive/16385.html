Also I have a free day today. <br/><br/>It seems like the biggest and maybe easiest bit of board game technology that has really hasn't been incorporated into most rpgs that I read is taking turns. No, I'm not being silly. When who can do what seems important to define, and yet so many rpg texts are so murky when it comes to this. I get that it's not important to some GM's, but it is to me. Guidelines are nice, but rules are better. <br/><br/>I have a friend for whom Apocalypse World falls apart because there wasn't enough structure for who gets to do what when. I've felt that way many times as a player with lots of different games. There's a battle inside of me where being able to talk over others to get more spotlight, do more moves, etc goes against being a dick. My head is full of trying to read the social cues at the table. And that is crowding out what's going on in the story, mechanics, and even fun ways to play or think as my character. This leads to me getting either stressed out, frustrated, or bored.<br/><br/>I also have a friend who hates being confined to the Mouse Guard Turn structure. He wants to just be able to do stuff and play his character with complete freedom.<br/><br/>Yes, these two games are not for these two people, but is there a way to reconcile or use "turns" to make rpgs better? <br/><br/>I'm not looking for anything specific. If you've got a thought, share it.

I dunno. I don't love institutionalizing a formal turn structure at the table, yet as a GM I'm hypersensitive to spotlight time and excitement levels. Non-participating players have about 10 minutes of attention span they'll give (at my table) and then eyes start to wander. If they're in a scene, I usually do an initiative-like thing *anyway* based on who started talking and at what time at the beginning of the scene. If there is a whole scene-by-scene split, I don't love that, but I do try to bounce back and forth.<br/><br/>But if I was *required* by the rules to do that? Dunno. I love what the MG turn structure does to the game, and I'm an even bigger fan of the scene economy in Burning Empires.

On your turn, you play a card from your hand, which corresponds to the type of action you take in the game, which you then describe (a sentence or two). Then it's the player to the left's turn. That's pretty much the whole game. It works very well, in that it's easy to start playing, and as a player you feel very supported by the structure, and it's broken down into small turns so that it's not intimidating. I say one small thing, and then it's the next player's turn. It will come back around to me soon, because turns are short. Since they're short, and we say small things, it is easy to take what other people have said and build on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374231/#Comment_374231" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T12:53:55+00:00" title="April 24, 2012 12:53PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about a reverse dutch auction for initiative/bonuses.

I'm not a fan if games ignore it entirely.<br/><br/>I like the ORE system where your die roll determines turn order. It really only holds for conflicts, and then combat is usually where it only matters. Though there are rules for determines the order of who gets to say what they are doing, that's more typical (and could be ignored).<br/><br/>I really like Fiasco's turns. They're aren't turns about when you get to go, but turns about when you get to have major control over a scene. Once the scene is established, then people in the scene talk, act, and converse like people do and there's no need to have a formalized turn order. I really like this method.<br/><br/>The Nobliis (3rd) method is interesting and works well in practice. It's basically just, whoever wants to go can go. If that is more than one person, find out if their actions need to have a specific order. If not, then it doesn't matter which goes first. If it does, then work out which one makes sense to go first. This could be based on the context of the action (e.g. throwing a car is faster than throwing the Moon) or player agreement, or failing that, the power of the miracle (e.g. throwing the moon is more powerful so goes first).  It's kind of like the new Marvel RPG's system, but instead of the player deciding who goes next, the GM and the players do.<br/><br/>Formalized turn orders that involve lengthy and complex turn actions can go hang, though. It just sucks to have the game focus on a single player for several minutes as they engage and wrestle with the mechanics to accomplish a discrete action. I understand why many traditional players brag when they make it through game sessions without touching the dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374244/#Comment_374244" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T14:52:38+00:00" title="April 24, 2012  2:52PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>It could be fun to do a turn auction, spending points from a pool to see who goes next.

People hated being forced to bid (I needed to make sure at least <i>someone</i> would go next), bidding "low" and accidentally winning when everyone else bid lower, and trying hard to win but getting edged out by somebody else.

The idea is that different players can provide a different "tone" for the scene -- the inspiration was thinking of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> as Sauron's player providing the adversity against Frodo when the Black Riders were chasing him, but Gandalf's player providing the adversity when they were dealing with Tom Bombadil's strangeness. I think it works pretty well, but a lot of people seem to be uncomfortable with the idea, since they're more familiar with either round-robin or a human using judgment and social cues to move the spotlight around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374249/#Comment_374249" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T15:59:23+00:00" title="April 24, 2012  3:59PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dont know if turns are so important as having a method to resolve conflicting intentions.

The more structure you can steal from board/card/party games, the more comfortable people who aren't already immersed in RPG culture will feel, and the easier your game will be to play the way you want it played. Your job as a game designer is to examine the negotiated structure that makes your game work with your friends and formalize that so that other people don't break it with their wildly different negotiated structure, and turns are a great tool to do that. (And as Jogesh mentioned, everybody can't talk at once, so your game already has a turn structure, even if you haven't written it down.)<br/><br/>I like to use turns for scene framing -- it does a nice job, in my experience, of breaking up the spotlight. Most people have a couple of good scene ideas, but if one person sets every scene, they tend to get less interesting bit by bit -- so divide that labor up and use everybody's best idea.

It's true that MG games follow this sequence - but I could run a game with a significantly different turn structure and still have it be about working members of the Guard.  In particular, the player turn scene structure is very rigidly defined compared to all possibilities of what the guardmice could do outside of a mission.  i.e. In MG play, a PC might have, say, two scenes based on his checks from the GM's turn - but being a guard mouse is consistent with 0, 1, 3, or even 8 scenes.  <br/><br/>The MG turn structure isn't just a consequence of being guard mice.  It is a deliberate way of focusing the game further than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374384/#Comment_374384" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T17:11:37+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  5:11PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

I think clever or to put it better, functional, systems heavily consider conversation. It depends on the desired effect of the system just how much conversation is used or not used. And yeah that varies with the group and then the people within that group. Designing RPGs is hard and awesome because of this. <br/><br/>I can read social cues myself, but it takes a lot of my concentration, and like I said above I tend to get frustrated or bored or whatever. I like board games a lot because they formalize the social cues a bit and take that process, that chore out of my head and onto the table. <br/><br/>The trouble is I like rpgs a whole hell of a lot too, and they don't tend to do that often. Or at least the ones that don't make me feel more adrift. Basketball would suck without a court and a clock. <br/><br/>Maybe we're talking about imposed limits? I feel like I can really let loose within a turn or framed scene. If there's no boundaries, and my GM says, "Just roleplay!", my first instinct is to steamroll everyone with me blabbing on with everything my character is doing. Not being a dick (reading those social cues) keeps me from doing this, but I just want to let loose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375821/#Comment_375821" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T04:50:32+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  4:50AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jogesh EZ</cite>The Nobliis (3rd) method is interesting and works well in practice.

If it does, then work out which one makes sense to go first. This could be based on the context of the action (e.g. throwing a car is faster than throwing the Moon) or player agreement, or failing that, the power of the miracle (e.g. throwing the moon is more powerful so goes first).

The action in a board game or sport is something physical done with the materials of the game. The players are talking to each other during these actions and on the periphery, but it's not usually considered to be part of the game mechanics.<br/><br/>RPGs are way interesting because when players are talking to each other, this IS considered to be part of the game mechanics or the "action". The only time that it seems like it's not is when the players are talking about the game, it's rules, or something not related to the game. <br/><br/>So spotlight issues come up when one player talks more than others or one player doesn't get to talk when they want to, etc. <br/><br/>Off of the top of my head, the only rpg that I can think of that limits talking, or in this case writing, is<i> Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</i>. (I'd argue that <i>Happy Birthday Robot</i> is not a rpg, but that's not really important.) <br/><br/>What else does this?

If players agree on the creative agenda at some point or they don't interrupt each other's agenda, then simultaneous resolution effectively happens.<br/>-Each player has a different level of spotlight need. Each player has a different rythm for adding their input to the fiction. Whatever the reason, players that talk more and players that talk less will need a way to play together. If giving them both exactly the same treatment/screen time doesn't work, then something else has to be arranged. Sometimes it can be solved out of the game by groups with certain degree of social skills. However I prefer games that offer advice about solving this in-game, or better yet, offer a mechanic or procedure ingrained with the game mechanics to solve this in an interesting way.<br/><br/>Curiously enough, I'd bet most of us have played in games where one player had a short turn, another took a long one, and a discussion was cut by the GM raining orcs over the party, all happening simultaneously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
