While the game aims at absurdity, when we played, it was more like those movies where you meet fifty minor characters whose fates criss-cross. Absolutely recommended - I don't know if there are other games that do this specific thing, and it makes for interesting emergent stories.<br/><br/>Short playtest notes:<br/>- We had one director and two players, which worked very well; with more players it would probably have been chaotic.<br/>- The signs were great. We sometimes interpreted them literally, and sometimes metaphorically; sometimes immediately, sometimes later on in the game.<br/>- Questions were also good. How much is the director supposed/allowed to use them to create stuff in the fiction? Our director did that quite a bit, which worked fine.<br/>- The director reincorporated characters quite a bit, which made for a more coherent story. I would recommend this in the rules.<br/>- We weren't completely sure about who introduces new characters, when it happens, and how. A few examples would help. When we played, the director would say stuff like "You're the ambulance driver's sister. Your sign is (...)", and often follow up immediately with questions "Why are you sad this morning?"<br/>- We hardly used the token economy at all, and when we did, it was only to test out how it worked.  We had one "conflict of interest". I don't think the game needs this mechanic, but if it stays, I'd strongly recommend just giving all players a few tokens at start: could be a matter of taste, but getting tokens for "good role-play" from the director rubs me the wrong way.<br/><br/>Notes on the rules:<br/>- I'd cut them to one-third of the length. <br/>- Remove vague advice, replace with concrete techniques and examples. Right now there's a bit of "be a good player" type advice in there.<br/>- Drop all negative advice ("don't be a wallflower or a childish player" etc), replace with positive advice ("be active, take the initiative, listen to other players").<br/>- Focus strongly on "be obvious". We mostly said the first things that came into our minds, often pretty banal everyday realistic stuff, and it worked out great.<br/>- Make a list of exactly what each player is supposed and allowed to do: Director, focus player, minor character player.<br/><br/>Question for the designer:<br/>- Does the game need to be absurd, or is it just how you imagined it would play out? We had some absurdity, but also a lot of pretty realistic and sober play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Magnus" title="Magnus"><img alt="Magnus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Magnus">Magnus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252992/#Comment_252992" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T20:12:37+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  8:12PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found it to be a fun game. The parts that I especially liked were also what I would consider the "key parts" of the system:\n<ul>\n<li> The long shot (no scene changes).</li>\n<li> Always one focus character, and the camera always stays on the focus character.</li>\n<li> Frequent character changes, causing a meandering story</li>\n</ul>\nI was the director (GM), and after reading the text I had expected the director's part to be a bit boring, as the director never gets to play any supporting characters. Steering the action through clever questioning proved to provide ample opportunities for input, though, and I ended up enjoying it.<br/><br/>The game is supposed to engender absurdist play, but I don't think we got a lot of that. I didn't miss it, though.<br/><br/>We didn't really use the token system much - that wasn't a conscious choice, we just never felt the need. If I had given out more tokens they would perhaps have been used more, but I don't realy think so. That's our preferences shining through, I guess.<br/><br/>The text itself works fine, but it could gain from being shortened and clarified - there are more words in there than there needs to be.

The three magi! All of you have my thanks and irrepressible admiration. <br/><br/>Before I respond to your questions and critiques, let me just throw out some things that came up during my play-testing over IRC:\n<ul>\n<li>Referral to the game-text becomes an unnecessary once all the players are aware of how the game operates. </li>\n<li>The director has a major role in controlling the pace of play (how often new elements are added and removed). </li>\n<li>How absurd or surreal the game becomes is entirely down to the responses and rationalization of the players; even <i>non sequitur </i> answers can be reincorporated as part of the internal narrative logic of the scenario.</li>\n<li>Three players or more players are harder than two; dialogue flows more naturally between a couple. </li>\n</ul>\nMy playtest involved:\n<ul>\n<li>A Romanian thief-child.</li>\n<li>A victimised (and correspondingly protagonised) businessman.</li>\n<li>A bored train-conductor.</li>\n<li>A man appearing to be sci-fi author W. Gilbert. </li>\n<li>Dangerous ice and severe head-trauma.</li>\n<li>A bomb concealed within a cavity wall.</li>\n<li>A confused 911-employee.</li>\n<li>A stoic, chain-smoking train-driver.</li>\n<li>Top-secret documents.</li>\n<li>A dramatic escape into snow-strewn woodland.</li>\n</ul>\nI'm making an assumption here but it feels like perhaps your playtest was quieter in nature, focusing on the growth and interaction of characters whereas (some of) my players were interested in adding external action elements. The desires of a group, or a faction of that group, contributes greatly to the character of play. Themes self-perpetuate; as we attempted (unconsciously) to rationalise bombs and mystery-men more 'spy-thriller' elements occurred. Or, at least, I found myself suggesting them as director without any real prompting and having them accepted by the players, and vice versa.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253014/#Comment_253014" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T00:04:03+00:00" title="January 27, 2010 12:04AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent! I'd like to personally thank each of you for your time; I genuinely hope my game was worthy of distracting you from the sights of Melbourne. <br/><br/>Some quick questions:<br/>How long did it take you to play? Was gameplay slow at times? Did you have trouble starting? Did you use any writing materials? Did you refer to the game-text during play? Was any section of the text incomprehensible? It's more a matter of personal playstyles, but did you read the text aloud or allow one to read and distribute the information however he or she felt expedient?  <br/><br/>You seem to have grasped signs really well and used them to enhance characters and their interactions. Perfect! I feel like a bridge-builder watching the smooth flow of traffic. <br/>Tokens seem like they were unnecessarily; an annoying physical tie. I didn't use them in my playtest either. I think they cropped up due to too much time spent at the Forge on my part, where having reward-based behavior-reinforcement is fashionable. Looking back I can see my folly: players need not be treated like Pavlov's dogs. I blame groupthink for this! <br/>The role of the Director can be an obtuse or focused as is comfortable for the group. I found that being assertive with question-facts ("You're an X-Y doing Z, why?")  helped initially but then stepping back and allowing an interaction or series of interactions to evolve organically with a few prompts ("How do you feel about that?" "Why?") worked in my playtest.<br/> I'd expected Matthijs to Direct as 'bringer' of the game. Magus, I'm pleased you came to enjoy the role. The input is of a different nature than character-acting but just as relevant. Did you ever find the need to add statements to add new elements to the scenario or make sense of current action, or did you act entirely through questioning?<br/><br/>It's interesting that some of you consider your experience to be 'absurd' and others not. Is this perhaps due to retroactive rationalization, reincorporation of characters/themes (certainly not required by the rules) or a tolerance of the nonsensical on some or all of your parts? <br/>I'd suggest that the absurd is not the surreal. Entirely normal situations may be absurd simply due to inherent meaninglessness or corruption of causality. However, If you were looking for the surreal in this game you would have certainly added it, but I don't think you did that. <br/>The game certainly doesn't need to be absurd, however, there just aren't any handrails stopping someone from pushing it all over into the abyss. <br/><br/>I must confess, this is my first foray into game-design and some preconceptions seep into the text (such as tokens). I certainly think the text length can (and will, in revisions) be shortened with certain elements being removed or changed. My authorial voice is new and thus confused: I mistake authoritative for negative (how <b>not</b> to play), which is a mistake. A separation of the necessities of play and then my advice on play as author needs to be made for a more focused text. <br/><br/>Thanks to all of you once again. I will revise the text as soon as possible, I hope I've answered any queries. <br/>Especial thanks to Matthijs and his <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">blog</a> for his help and inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253328/#Comment_253328" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T19:22:31+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  7:22PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick iPhone post from Abu Dhabi <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Absurdity: The everyday can certainly be absurd.
