It's hot and sunny, and I see once again that all my seemingly original thoughts were thought by somebody else long ago. <br/><br/>* Role-playing as a way of processing archetypes, a form of unconscious therapy? IF issue 2: "Freud and Campbell: myth and archetype in RPGs". Oh yes, I remember reading that, actually.<br/>* Education and role-playing, something we're focusing on at this year's Knutepunkt - surely a new trend? IF issue 2, again: "Special feature: Role-playing and education". <br/><br/>Oh, some things have progressed - we have new terminology, which is good. (Although, again from IF issue 2: "On the Vocabulary of Role-playing"). And Ron has defined narrativism in a useful way (well, I assume it was him). Still, though - \n<blockquote>And do-on't throw the past away<br/>You might need it some other rainy day<br/>Dreams can come true again<br/>When everything old is new again</blockquote>\nBTW, what happened to the people behind IF?<br/>James Wallis runs the games consultancy spaaace.com, and occasionally posts <a href="http://www.spaaace.com/cope/" rel="nofollow">excellent stuff on his blog</a>.<br/>Andrew Rilstone has worked a bit on computer game design - and designed games for LEGO. I think he's currently a freelance journalist.

I'm not sure how useful the idea that nothing changes is. Didn't they try to shut down the patent offices in the 1800's because of a so called lack of new things to invent? <br/><br/>The language you use perhaps is part of the problem. Its not just the terminology that has changes, but also the points of view, the body of available evidence, and the common practices that have changed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Haakon" title="Haakon"><img alt="Haakon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Haakon">Haakon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201710/#Comment_201710" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-12T20:07:49+00:00" title="April 12, 2009  8:07PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The original Legend of the Five Rings RPG was steeped in John Campbells Monomyt.
