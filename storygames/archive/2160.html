I have to agree with Troy.  This does indie games a great disservice.  Oh, wait, except for one thing.<br/>

This isn't very well explained.  In fact, I don't think much thought was given to the line at all, but it's the one thing in the indie section of the article I can agree with.  See, it's important that the strength of the work be judged by actual play.<br/>

Sandy, if you should read this, try researching your next article.  Okay?                        </div>

He's really talking about published games here, not designed games.  There's a huge difference between the two.  I'd like him to point out a thread anywhere where someone who has participated in the Forge Booth at GenCon or ran their own booth there has said their game is "Not necessarily intended to be played" or "designed for designers."  It's utter nonsense and I can't believe someone of his stature would even suggest such a thing.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

Maybe he's talking about the 24 hour games on 1km1kt, cause I can't possibly imagine he would mean anything like Polaris, PTA, My Life with Master, Unversalis, etc.  I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt and say maaaaaaaaaybe me means those 24 hour games, but it sure doesn't seem like it.  <br/><br/>I especially can't believe this line: "The game is often read and critiqued by others, again without actual play being required."   That <b>only</b> to the Ronny or GameChef competitions.  Cause I don't know for a fact Actual Play threads of a game are way more important to an Indie designer than a randon review on TheRPGSite or RPGnet.  Unless Antunes thinks the whole Indie movement is what goes on w/ 24hr RPGs and GameChef, this line is inexcusable.  I mean, how hard to we stress outside playtesting before publication?!??!

                            All three of those definitions seem far too idiosyncratic to be useful.  You're either planning your first <i>cycle</i> of supplements alognside the game, or you're patching someone else's system, or you've a vision of a game that you're designing to be read.  And none of the name match up to the definitions - "indie" is just the worst of the bunch.<br/><br/>Still - I agree with Graham.  There's <i>something</i> there.  Like I said in the column comments - rename "indie" to "sampler", remove some of the baggage and you've got the beginings of a useful definition for something.                        </div>

                            Let's take a look at everything that Sandy said:
<blockquote>Indie<br/><br/>Indie games are games designed and written but not necessarily intended to be played. This definition is, admitably, somewhat controversial, but I feel it best characterizes the indie movement.<br/><br/>While many designers hope their game is played, their goal in creating an indie game is to craft a strong work.<br/><br/>This is in contrast to a high concept game, which is designed for sales, or a homebrew, which is publication of the game they're playing. An indie game is, first and foremost, an author's creation for their specific purpose.<br/><br/>Indie reflects a design attitude focused on making the best game, not the most accessible or saleable game. Yet oddly enough, accessibility can be one of the creator's self-applied design goals, leading to a categorical cross-over with the marketable 'high concept' games.<br/><br/>Similarly, an indie designer may design a game with the purpose of reaching an audience not yet served--designing a game for young kids, for example. This is a high-concept game (designing a game to appeal to a specific niche), despite their indie pedigree. So the categories of 'high concept' and 'indie' are not far apart, and certainly not a function of market cap.<br/><br/>The mechanics for an indie game are deeply tied into the setting or, if the game is setting-free, the mechanics themselves are the game. The game is often read and critiqued by others, again without actual play being required.<br/><br/>There is also a small school of indie game design that takes an existing game and reworks it. I consider that 'homebrew indie', a hybrid owing more to indie game design than the publishing dreams of homebrew. </blockquote>
This:<br/>**<b>Indie games are games designed and written but not necessarily intended to be played.</b>**<br/><br/>Is the only part of that that I don't agree with, but with a little rewording could probably understand where he's coming from. I agree with the rest of his statements pretty much 100%. Aside from that one "not intended to be played" bit, are people finding other parts of that characterization that are wrong in their book? Cause for the way he's breaking it down (and for some reason using "Indie" to mean something other than "Independently Published") doesn't really rub me the wrong way at all.<br/><br/><b>EDIT:</b> Forgot this part:<br/><b>The game is often read and critiqued by others, again without actual play being required.</b> Yeah, here it's pretty clear that he's talking solely about Gamechef and 24HourRPG, which Sandy has participated in (both of them, actually!). I don't mind those activities being labeled as he did so here ('critiqued, not requiring actual play', etc), but from there to "On the Shelf" either means:<br/><br/>1) You playtested the fuck out of it, and probably revised about 70-95% of it, or else<br/>2) You rushed it to the stands as-is, and it kinda sucks.<br/><br/>Do I do think there's a bit of being uninformed with thinking that games that have come out of the Forge (or Most of them, anyway) were generated along the same lines as a "critiqued and unplayed" game like those in the 24 Hour RPG or Game Chef contest.  I'd say that he's not doing it maliciously/deliberately.<br/><br/>More objectively, part of me is wondering if he was using his article to show how "A Faery's Tale" somehow isn't 'indie', as a lot of those "rec an Indie game" usually sees a couple recs for that game. But anyway, that's a side note.<br/><br/>Honestly, though, more than ever it's kinda showing me how recently the whole concept of using words like "indie" (and the definition of Indie I still vehemently recognize as "Creator Owned and Produced") is just too full of holes, air and/or crap to be really meaningful anymore.<br/><br/>I don't have any better word to take its place. "Lesser Known Games"? "Small Run Games"? "Thematic Roleplaying?" "Story Games*"?I like the concept of Self Produced and all (and will probably keep using that term over Indie), but when it comes to classifying games, "Indie" has for better or worse built up this whole group of notions around it.<br/><br/>A lot of things are changing. I wonder what the landscape of terms is going to look like in a year or two.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* incidentally, "Story Games" as an actual reference to RPGs has been something that never quite settled right for me. It was just meant to be the name of this site, originally. But hey, I couldn't find any better term, and it is kinda catchy.                        </div>

                            In my opinion...<br/><br/>Sandy is saying "Most of the games on The Forge, Game Chef and 1km1kt are never played. Their main function is that the designer enjoyed designing them". This is a good point.<br/><br/>Troy is saying "All the successful indie games are played extensively during design and designed to be played". This is a good point too.<br/><br/>In fact, if you read Sandy's definition of Homebrew...
<blockquote>The difference between a high concept and homebrew game, even if both are built from scratch, is largely that homebrew games were fun for the creators, so they hope they'll be fun for game buyers...Put simply, it's "we play this and think you'll like this" versus "we created this for you to like". Homebrews are what most small fantasy RPG publishers seek to publish. </blockquote>
...and perhaps replace the last sentence with "Homebrews can be published successfully", then the two sides of the argument don't look so different.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate, of course, that Sandy has labelled the unplayed games "indie". He's doing this to be provocative, of course. But it obscures his point.<br/><br/>Troy, I hear you when you say...
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>I especially can't believe this line: "The game is often read and critiqued by others, again without actual play being required."   That<b>only</b>to the Ronny or GameChef competitions.</blockquote>
...and, yes, of course nobody designs a game <i>just</i> to be critiqued. They want it to be played.<br/><br/>But can you see the truth behind this? Many games (in competitions, in First Thoughts on the Forge, on Story Games) seem aimed to provoke discussion on bulletin boards, not to be played. Isn't that a fair critique?<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>[Crossposted with Andy, who is saying good stuff]                        </div>

-No doubt that most of the games brought up in the design forums at the Forge, SG, and RPGnet don't make it to print.  It's usually because, like you say, someone is just throwing out an idea to discuss or because the designer flakes out on the project because publishing an RPG is really hard to do (even a free one).  But Sandy's article is clearly not about games being designed, it's about games being published.  Check out the opening line of his article:
<blockquote>RPG development is dominated by three schools of thought, which break down loosly into "design for the market" (high concept), "sell what we play" (homebrew), or "design for the designer" (indie).</blockquote>
You don't say things like "Designed for the Market" or "Sell what we play" if you're talking about games discussed on a message board.  When he says this:
<blockquote>Indie games are games designed and written but not necessarily intended to be played.  This definition is, admitably, somewhat controversial, but I feel it best characterizes the indie movement.</blockquote>
He's talking about the whole thing.  Published, not published, and anything in between.  When he does that he's including Luke Crane, Jaren Sorensen, Ron Edwards, Vincent Baker, Paul Czege, Clinton Nixon, etc etc etc.  Get real.  If what he really meant was games people talk about but never produce his three catagories should have been, "High Hopes, Homebrew, and Guys Who Just Post Stuff on Messageboards."  That would have been a lot more genuine and accurate.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

Because Sandy is awesome.  He has, among other things, hooked up a Beowulf cluster of like 50-80 PCs to make one of the most powerful computers on the planet, which he used to process data to get his Astrophysics PhD.  He's also big into the design contests, and probably the biggest LARPer I have heard of (IIRC, he prefers LARPS over RPGs).<br/><br/>...which has nothing to do with the article, but I still think that that clustering computers thing (and the PhD in Astrophysics) make him an Interesting Guy in my book. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/><br/>Andy has a good idea, let's break this thing down point by point and have a good discussion about it:
<blockquote>RPG development is dominated by three schools of thought, which break down loosly into "design for the market" (high concept), "sell what we play" (homebrew), or "design for the designer" (indie).</blockquote>
Market is pretty undefined here, but the only game I can think of that wasn't designed for "the Market" was Spione.  I'm willing to be corrected on this.  "Sell what we play" is exactly what Indie publishers do, so I have no earthly idea why something like that is specific only to Homebrew games.  Gamed designed for designers?  If he means exclusively, I'm at a loss to name even one.  Perhaps someone out there can name a few games meant just for designers.  If he means games that might interest designers, just about every game ever printed would fall into that category for one reason or another.  Thus, these distinctions appear pretty bogus from the get-go.
<blockquote>Indie games are games designed and written but not necessarily intended to be played. This definition is, admitably, somewhat controversial, but I feel it best characterizes the indie movement.</blockquote>
I can't think of anything more untrue about the "indie movement."  That's the last thing Ron, Vincent, Luke, eh you know their names, would want.  This, by far, is the most absurd part of the article and it's his <b>thesis</b> for the Indie section.  Where is his documentation this is true?  Where has anyone ever said stuff like this?  I'd like for him to point to one person at the Forge booth, Key 20 booth, or on IPR who would agree with that statement about their games.
<blockquote>their goal in creating an indie game is to craft a strong work</blockquote>
I would agree that this is very true, at least for the most part.  However, by stating this as a quality of Indie games, is he saying that the other two categories <b>don't</b> strive to craft a strong work?  Are their designs some how weaker by comparison?  It seems wholly unfair to those guys who do create homebrews or mass market games to say something like this.  I guarantee the guys who created Promethian would object to their game not being called an attempt to craft a strong work.  This line is both a compliment and an insult, IMO.
<blockquote>This is in contrast to a high concept game, which is designed for sales</blockquote>
Is he saying a strong work won't achieve good sales?  Or that a designer has to choose between high sales and strong game design?  I take issue with that.  Dogs in the Vineyard and Burning Empires are doing just fine.  Not only that, but DnD 3.x is a very strong and tite design.  In fact, it's one of strongest Gamist designs that's come along in years.  This statement is so incredibly absurd.<br/><br/>Continued....                        </div>

<blockquote>Indie reflects a design attitude focused on making the best game, not the most accessible or saleable game.</blockquote>
WTH?  PTA, Capes, Cutthroat, DitV, 1001 Nights, Breaking the Ice, TSoY, etc etc etc are all designed to be accessible and most if not all Indie RPGs are designed to be sellable.  If anyone purposely makes their game difficult to sell, I'm sure it would be for business purposes, not because they want a game that's too exclusive for someone to pick up and play.  I mean, this is the whole point of System Does Matter.  You can pick up an Indie RPG, read it, and be able to play it right away.  We strive for accessibility.  As for the sales, most of us want them for sure. But if he's talking White Wolf or even Green Ronin level of sales, there's not many who can match that Indie or not.  Again, his article here is hampered by not defining what he means.
<blockquote>An indie game is, first and foremost, an author's creation for their specific purpose.</blockquote>
This is very true and one of the most levelheaded thing he writes in this article.  I have to say I agree that probably most Indie designers feel this way.
<blockquote>Yet oddly enough, accessibility can be one of the creator's self-applied design goals, leading to a categorical cross-over with the marketable 'high concept' games.</blockquote>
Ah nice, a self-contradiction.  If the Indie design attitude is to create a game that is inaccessible and unsellable, then is a game where the designer's purpose is to create a game that <b>is</b> accessible and sellable Indie anymore?  So the earlier distinction between "designed for the market" and "designed for designers" is so strong after all.  It looks a game can do both.  And if so, does it belong in both categories or neither?  If both, do the categories really matter in the first place?  In fact, at this point we have to start questioning whether they exist at all.  I think he catches this and tries to fix it in the next paragraph but actually makes it a worse contradiction:
<blockquote>So the categories of 'high concept' and 'indie' are not far apart, and certainly not a function of market cap.</blockquote>
So if a game is in the Indie game category it is something that is not "designed for the market", accessible, or sellable but yet really "not apart far apart" from games that are all those things, then what the heck is an Indie RPG according to this guy?  I mean seriously, he's gone back and forth on this so many times I'm at a loss to understand what he means by it.  First he draws a contrast between High Concept and Indie and then says they're a lot alike!  So....Is an Indie RPG something "designed for the designers" and not "accessible" or is it something that can appeal to a Market full of people who <b>play</b> RPGs?
<blockquote>The mechanics for an indie game are deeply tied into the setting or, if the game is setting-free, the mechanics themselves are the game.</blockquote>
I think it's unfortunate, but Setting exploration has been chased of Indie design over the years.  Exploration has focused on many other areas since the movement started.  But, the problem with this statement really is the fact he gives us NO EXAMPLES of what heâ€™s talking about!
<blockquote>The game is often read and critiqued by others, again without actual play being required.</blockquote>
Is actual play required or a critique of any game?  How many reviews on RPGnet are written by people who have only read but not played the game they're talking about?  That doesn't lessen the critique in any way.  Additionally, Indie publishers place high value on Actual Player reports about their games.  Those are what really sells the games and what really demonstrate a game's strengths and weaknesses.  That's where the real critique of Indie games goes on.  Not on message boards and not in review columns.  This statement is totally bogus because it applies to every kind of game produced, not just Indie games.
<blockquote>There is also a small school of indie game design that takes an existing game and reworks it. I consider that 'homebrew indie', a hybrid owing more to indie game design than the publishing dreams of homebrew.</blockquote>
I think Jonathan Walton's Exalted Hack and the Awesome-o-fied threads here fall into this catagory.  I can see where he's coming from.  This might be the one place where his definitions line up well with each other.
<blockquote>And 'indie', ah blessed indie, this field is the realm of writing games for the joy of writing games. The Forge is a well-known website by and for indie game designers. 1KM1KT is a great motivator for trying your own indie design. And one advantage of their Game Chef challenge (also in print form) is that the Game Chef entries get judged, resulting in a 'best of breed' set of games each year.</blockquote>
This is from his Examples section.  Of course, none of these are examples of Indie RPGs he's talking about.  They're two websites and a contest.  So I'm not sure how this is supposed to help a reader better understand what he means here.  But let's break this down.  "indie, ah blessed indie" clearly a sarcastic and derogatory comment.  His agenda for this article is starting to come into focus.  And it is also here that I thin he makes his biggest mistake.  He specifically cites the Forge and 1km1kt.  If he had avoided mentioning these two sites, I might have been able to go with him on this.  He might be offering a new definition of "indie" that didn't include the work that goes on at these sites and the people associated with them.  All of what he said above definitely does not pertain to the philosophy of the Forge and those who are inspired by its body of work.   In fact, it is the antithesis of what the Forge has been about.  1km1kt is an outgrowth of the Forge and its games are not meant to be the final step in the design process (are they, Andy?).  That site is a stepping stone intended to help designers get to the next level- by providing free versions of game designs for people to download and <b>play</b>!
<blockquote>this field is the realm of writing games for the joy of writing games</blockquote>
Where does he get that?  Is that mission statement of any website?  Not just the ones he mentions, but any site at all?  He does not document this statement nor trace it back to any specific examples anywhere.  And there is a huge amount of evidence to show that this is wholly untrue.  I just don't get it.<br/><br/>Andy, I think you made a good point when you said he might be trying to draw a contrast between Forge-inspired Indie games and Faerie's Tale.  But man, he did a terrible job, IMO.  This article is just a mess, and I only talked about the portions dealing with Indie games.  The rest of the sections are just as bad!<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope Sandy comes out and clarifies what he means.  As the founder of one of the most popular and historic RPG sites on the Internet, I expect better of him.  He <b>is</b> awesome, and I am surprised this game from him.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            Um, I think you guys are giving Sandy a lot of flack for that one comment.  I think his description of indie games is pretty accurate, overall.  I'd probably change "not intended to be played" to something more like "no intended to necessarily sell a million copies."  He's totally right that indie games are about the purity of the author's intentions and whether the game fulfills them.  The fact that other people might want to buy and play the game is secondary to the author's own motivations for producing it.                        </div>

                            I think Sandy's has three main points that I see, and that some of you are being too offended to notice.<br/><br/>1/ This is how indie games are perceived by one of the gaming intelligentsia. Like Sandy or don't (I think he is a brilliant and incredibly nice guy) but listen to him. If you guys aren't communicating what you are doing well to a guy who should know you and your work then that is not Sandy's fault. It means you aren't marketing yourselves or your ideas.<br/><br/>2/ The creator-owned definition doesn't work. Espescially if I hear one more guy say that Chris Pramas, or Peter Adkison, or whomever isn't "indie" enough because he became a big (or just bigger) business.<br/><br/>3/ By Sandy's definitions The Shadow of Yesterday, Sorcerer, and many other "published" indie games are homebrew and not indie.<br/><br/>This is me, from the outside. <br/><br/>"watchin ur games and critiquing ur ideas..."<br/><br/>Ross                        </div>

So, why do we need to redefine "indie" so that all successful indie games fall outside the definition? That strikes me as an assault on the term, not a useful attempt to define it.                        </div>

RE #1:  It is not a perception Sandy has it's a complete lack of knowledge when it comes to the Indie movement.  I'll say it again, if he hadn't brought up the Forge and 1km1kt I'd give him a pass on it.  But it is abundantly clear he doesn't have the slightest clue about the history and priorities of those two sites and the Indie movement they helped spawn.<br/><br/>RE #2:  The creator owned definition <b>does</b> work.  It's when people try to use something else that problems and controversies arise.  The guys you name were Independant Publishers at one time.  But when they lost creative control of their own works, they ceased to be Independant.  They became controlled.  That's where the line is crossed.<br/><br/>RE #3: If Sorcerer and TSOY fall under the Homebrew catagory not only is he using a new never-before-hear-of definition for Indie but now also a whole new definition for Homebrew.  Examples would have helped!!!!  This article is such a pitiful attempt to explain a point of view that I'm shocked Sandy allowed himself to publish it on his own site.  He's so much more capable than this.<br/><br/>Brennan:  Right on!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            It strikes me that Sandy is confusing the following: <br/><br/>Indie games don't sell a lot <i>to gamers</i>.<br/><br/>Indie games aren't played a lot <i>by gamers</i>. <br/><br/>I think it's pretty implicit throughout his article that he assumes the traditional market, method of distribution, and success-in-terms-of-visible-sales is a good, given thing in his mind. I may be wrong about that. (None of these are good or given in my mind.)<br/><br/>For example, I would go so far as to counter his controversial statement with one of my own: That the High Concept games, as Sandy defines them, are not designed to be played. They are designed to be bought and read. Oh, certainly people play them. Many people. I find play of them to occur <i>in spite</i> of their designs. I do find their appeal, within the market of gamers, to be deliberate. That's why I say they're <i>designed</i> to be bought and read. <br/><br/>I believe that designs of many such games are deliberately altered and watered down in such a way to appeal to a convention, a tradition of expectations among the sub-culture of gamers. As evidence, I point to the almost-exciting mechanics we see beginning to pop up in games like Exalted Second Edition. They're <i>nearly</i> revolutionary, but they soft-pedal so much it's a wonder they made it in the design at all. It's as though you can hear voices of editors arguing whether "gamers will be comfortable with it." Sigh.                        </div>

What's shocking to me is that with brand recognition and distro systems in place, those companies are <b>more fearful</b> of experimenting in design.                        </div>

                            When I first clicked on this thread, I hadn't read Sandy's article. <br/><br/>So I read through a few comments, where quotes were taken out of context, and much blustering and indignation occurred. <br/><br/>Then I went and skimmed Sandy's article. I returned here and waded through most of the comments on this thread. <br/><br/>Then I went back and read Sandy's article again, because I couldn't understand why one of the folks who's pretty darn close to a modern scholar on roleplaying would have written an article as bad as y'all have made it out to be. <br/><br/>Story Games and the Forge population have very ingrained, personal, invested concepts of "indie." Without that personal investment, it's pretty easy to see that Sandy's not that far off the mark. Maybe he didn't choose the words that would make everyone happy, or communicate perfectly to everyone, but then again, this is the web, and opinions are a dime a dozen. <br/><br/>I don't see any major problems with his definitions. <br/>In a nutshell, as I interpreted his article...<br/>High Concept: priority is marketability<br/>Homebrew: priority is sharing what worked for you/your group<br/>Indie: priority is the design effort<br/><br/>They're a bit nebulous, and there's some overlap, but he acknowledges that. <br/>And everyone wants sales, don't they? That's independent of the above priorities: marketability, proven worth, and solid design contribute to/influence sales. <br/><br/>Instead of railing against the machine, as it were, you might consider that Sandy's article forces you to determine what your real priorities are, regardless of what you label those priorities. <br/><br/>When I wrote Dead of Night, it was to write something new. I wasn't overly concerned about sales, but it would have been nice to make some money. My focus was the design effort, and Sandy would consider my design "indie". I wouldn't, but if I used his definitions, I've got to agree.  Who else wants to accuse me of having written an indie game? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            I think this isn't Sandy's best article to date, but that the charitable readings are the correct ones. That is, I don't think he means to imply...well, what he does imply to a certain extent.<br/>
<br/>
I mean it's a little ironic, no, that Sandy, Sam Chupp, Zak Arneston and I just published a pretty indie-ish little book on playing RPGs with your kids through his imprimature.<br/>

I guess maybe I'm sold out now, then?<br/>

                            JBR: <br>I fully agree. <br><br>But I have to also ask. What fraction of indie games do we all actually play? <br><br>Count 'em up, let me know what fraction of 24-hour RPGs and Game Chef designs you've actually played. <br><br>Me? Zero. <br><br/>How many have I downloaded? A crapload. How many have I actually read through? Maybe a handful (that's five or less). I have a dozen or so indie RPGs that I also haven't played. I think, for all the time I spend here, I've played maybe two indie RPGs in my life. One for sure, but I'm giving myself the benefit of the doubt. <br/><br/>Trust me, I know a bunch of you are much better than I am at trying out new RPGs. But how many, and to what extent?  <br/><br/>Now turn that around: <br/>In general, when folks create an indie design, do they really intend/expect them to be played, or are they just getting ideas out of their head? <br/>I dunno. It's pretty fuzzy to me -- I design for play, but I have no expectation that my game will be played. So at some point, I'm just getting those ideas down on paper.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Ya know, if you took out the line "Indie games are games designed and written but not necessarily intended to be played" I'd agree with much of what Sandy says. <br/><br/>Indie games, by and large, are often based around an idea of "design attitude focused on making the best game, not the most accessible or saleable game." The error is thinking that focus on design quality means that there is not also an equal (or greater) intent to be played. <br/><br/>That particular argument can (and has in this tread) be made against both other types of games as well. And in every case I think that it is false when applied as a blanket statement. <br/><br/>Other than that... yea, the article seems okay. I don't know if I'll get a lot of mileage out of the definitions (is Princes Kingdom Indie, High Concept, or Homebrew? -- this is less than clear and one of the problems of such categorization) but I hardly found it offensive.                        </div>

                            Merwin, the notion of playing a game designed in 24 hours or even a week for Game Chef, is silly. Nobody plays those games as finished in the competition. What comes out of those competitions is some ideas, and some proto-designs.<br/>
<br/>
Some of which designs end up being sold in spades like The Mountain Witch, and being awarded Indie Game of the Year like Polaris <i>when they've been finished up</i>. Based on the fact that people have played the crap out of these actually finished games.<br/>
<br/>
The contests do not produce finished products. Many designs on the fora never get finished. Until a game is published, no, the designer doesn't intend for it to be played. Produced for review in a game design competition is not equal to published.<br/>

When they do finish and publish these games, they are intended to be played, and they sell well.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ross</cite>I think Sandy's has three main points that I see, and that some of you are being too offended to notice.<br><br/>1/ This is how indie games are perceived by one of the gaming intelligentsia. Like Sandy or don't (I think he is a brilliant and incredibly nice guy) but listen to him. If you guys aren't communicating what you are doing well to a guy who should know you and your work then that is not Sandy's fault. It means you aren't marketing yourselves or your ideas.<br/><br/>2/ The creator-owned definition doesn't work. Espescially if I hear one more guy say that Chris Pramas, or Peter Adkison, or whomever isn't "indie" enough because he became a big (or just bigger) business.<br/><br/>3/ By Sandy's definitions The Shadow of Yesterday, Sorcerer, and many other "published" indie games are homebrew and not indie.</br></blockquote>
Are these really Sandy's points?  As far as I can read, he doesn't mention The Shadow of Yesterday or Sorcerer, and he doesn't give any examples of indie games -- just a general pointer to the Forge.  He doesn't mention the creator-owned definition at all.  Still, they're reasonable enough points, so I'll comment on them.  <br/><br/>I don't think that the gaming intelligentsia actually, say, considers Sorcerer to not be indie.  At least, as far as I have seen, to the people who have heard of indie gaming at all, Sorcerer is considered indie.  <br/><br/>As far as creator-owned...   As far as I've seen, Peter Adkinson and Chris Pramas are no longer considered indie authors not because they have a lot of sales, but because they ceased to write games.  Chris Pramas' last RPG author credit was Ork! (with Todd Miller) in 2000.  Peter Adkinson's last author credit was The Primal Order in 1992. <br/><br/>Now, there are a lot of people who use the term indie not to mean creator-owned -- sometimes not considering games "indie" if they're too traditional or considering non-creator-owned games to be indie if they're similar to some other indie games.  But my solution to that is to push for more standard use of the most prominent definition, rather than replacing it with a definition which doesn't represent any current usage (and is vague to boot).                        </div>

Huh?<br/> <br/>"24 HOUR RPG is basically the budding and professional game designer's equivalent of a triathalon- You put your body, mind and spirit through some major punishment in a race against time, in this case to <b>develop a full, working, playable role-playing game within a mere 24 hours</b> with other peers. Like a triathalon, there's no "award" for winning; Rather the award is in itself to participate, test yourself, overcome the challenge at hand at your own pace and skill level, and share in the brief glory with your peers." <br/><br/>Any RPG which isn't complete and playable at the end of 24 hours has failed the rules challenge. They're supposed to be finished. No one's going to stop writers from refining their work, but that's got nothing to do with the initial rules challenge. <br/><br/>In this day and age, when anyone can (and does) PDF their file, and make it available on the web, you'll have a hard time convincing me that this is not "publication." I seem to recall entire other threads on that topic.                        </div>

As a suggestion, <br/><br/>From <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/about/" rel="nofollow"><b>About the Forge</b></a>, circa 2000: 
<blockquote><i>What is an independent role-playing game? Our main criterion is that the game is owned by its author, or creator-owned. We don't care what its physical format is - it can be:<br/>* a book in the game store<br/>* a PDF or HTML download from the Internet<br/>* a direct mail-order only<br/>* or anything else that is readily available<br/><br/>The Forge is not only a place for role-playing game authors, though. It's here for anyone interested in discovering new games, having better role-playing experiences, or discussing role-playing game theory.</i></blockquote>
From <a href="http://www.rpg-awards.com/faq.shtml#1a" rel="nofollow"><b>Indie RPG Awards FAQ <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231a&amp;Mode=like">#1a</a></b></a>, circa 2002: 
<blockquote><i>What is an "Indie" Role Playing Game (RPG)?<br/><br/>"Indie" is short for Independent, meaning, "independently created and owned". There is no ontological definition for "Independent RPG", but we came up with a definition for the purpose of these awards:<br/><br/>* A game where the creator is the person who has written at least 50% of the actual game content.<br/>* A game where the creator has full control of content and publishing. They can say, "I'd like to print 200 more copies" or "I'll drop the price by 50%", "I think this game needs more ninjas..." and do so without asking permission or checking with anyone else.<br/>* A game where the creator is the publisher: They alone are responsible for paying all the costs of printing, art, advertising, etc. They also have full executive receipt and full control over the disbursement of profits.<br/><br/>Here is a quick-and-dirty guide. First, check the copyright. If the copyright goes to the author of the game, odds are high that it's an indie RPG. If the copyright goes to a company, and that company is run by the game's author (or the company consists solely of the author), odds are high that it's an indie RPG.</i></blockquote>
These two aren't entirely consistent, but they're pretty close, and I think they've got a fair amount of momentum and enthusiasm behind them.                        </div>

                            John's definition of Indie works for me, most of the time. There are some places where it can get tricky, but I like the general idea of it. <br/><br/>I also like the fact that much of it is checkable. As opposed to other definitions where you kind of have to guess or have insider information in order to categorize a game based upon intent or insider history.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rumble</cite>But I have to also ask. What fraction of indie games do we all actually play?</blockquote>
Merwin, let me turn the question around and ask the "indie" designers around here: what fraction of your indie game designs have you published and not played?  Me, the only game on that list is a Game Chef game.  One of three that I've written; the other two I played to see how they worked.  And seriously, counting Game Chef and its ilk as "indie" is kind of screwy, anyway.<br/><br/>Not to mention, the difference between "intended to be played" and "actually get played" is kind of... large.  How many "indie" designers have created games that they've had no intention of playing themselves or seeing anybody else play?  Show of hands?  Anybody?<br/><br/>Sandy published an article with an extremely inaccurate statement in it.  The statement, composed of words, communicates a postulate which is not representative of reality.  Today at work I just got done fixing a textbook that characterized the Michelson-Morley experiment as an attempt to determine the velocity of the Earth, the result of a bad round of synonym-replacement edits.  It's the same thing.  Innocent mistake or no, it's inaccurate.                        </div>

-Mike, you didn't sell out.  This article is not typical of Sandy's work, at all.  It's from way out in left field.  I mean, I wonder if somehow his April Fool's article got published early or something.  This article is non-sensicle, baseless, and self contradictory.  Charitable reading or not, this article is crap and I'm wondering what his basis for writing it was.

This is how I read it as well. High Concept games are designed to be marketed and sold to the existing "gamer" population. Homebrews are something a group somewhere cooked up and it might work for the "gamer" population or not. Indies (which is a bit misleading term, in this context) are not designed to satisfy the same needs that High Concept games are, but to do something else. Which, I suppose, is why there's something of an image that they are mostly played by other folks designing similar games, be it true or not.<br/><br/>All in all, three very intresting categories, all for different reasons.                        </div>

Hmm. <br/><br/>Do you see a difference between <br/><br/>1) intended to be played <br/>2) intended to "work" when played  (I'm sorry, I can't come up with a better word than "work" at the moment.) <br/><br/>?<br/><br/>I see a difference, which is why I'm giving Sandy the benefit of the doubt here. Of course, he could very well have erred. But when I read his article, I made this distinction. <br/><br/>Personally, my problem with Sandy's articles lies largely with the examples, and not so much with the definitions. The conceptual framework he lays down is as high-handed as any other similar framework, with the disadvantage that the other ideas are already established.                        </div>

Sadly, yes.  In the mainstream (aka "High Concept") I see a lot of products that are certainly written with the expectation that fanboys will buy the book and play a game of the same title as that book, but I see very little attention given to ensuring that the ensuing game has much to do with the flavor and color in the book.  It's like getting somebody all excited about drag racing and then selling them a Model T, <em>fully expecting</em> them to be racing the car around and thinking they're rockstar racecar drivers.<br/><br/>Now, are there some folks out there who are capable of taking the Model T and souping it up so it can go 100mph?  Sure.  Are those people the majority of the market the High Concept books are being sold to?  Hell no.                        </div>

                            Ash:  By definition, any product is marketed at 100% of the consumers within its market.  Its market is defined by what it is marketed to.<br/>
<br/>
I don't quite get how you could sensibly say that, for instance, sellers of Louis XIV antiques are "indie" because they aren't marketing to 100% of the "furniture market" as defined by IKEA sales.<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  Or, just as easily, sellers of junk cell-phones on the cheapy-cheap are "indie" because they aren't marketing to 100% of the "cell-phone market" as coverd by the toys in the Sharper Image catalog ... there's no inherent value judgment that indie games are the Louis Quatorze of RPGs, but I'll clarify lest anyone misread the example.                        </div>

                            I feel like I'm pulling rank or something, but...<br/>
<br/>
Merwin, when I took and implemented Jared and Clinton's idea for Iron Game Chef, and actuallly made it an event, I had certain criteria for the winner. First, if you read my reviews of those games in those three events, you'll see that I'm being quite flip about the whole thing, and that it's not really very serious.<br/>
<br/>
Second, and even more telling, one of the scoring criteria is "Completeness." Where a ten means "theoretically it might be playable as written." I don't think I ever gave out a ten in that category. Because everyone realizes that even if the game has a set of rules that seems to cover most stuff...even if a really experienced GM could maybe run the game as written by filling in the blanks a lot...that doesn't equate to the game being really complete as written.<br/>
<br/>
In point of fact, at one point we were considering publishing a book of some of the entries (had it in the works), and were going to subtitle it "Half-baked designs." Meaning that in the foreword that I wrote for it, it explained quite clearly that these designs were not complete, but just ideas for games as people had come up with them. Very much a caveat emptor thing saying that people should only play these games at their own risk. That we weren't publishing them saying that they were ready to play.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I didn't write the 24 hour game text, Andy did, I think? Anyhow, I think by "complete" here, they mean, "Has all the elements that you'd expect to see in a RPG." Like "theoretically playable." But that's a far cry from "I'd publish it in this format."<br/>
<br/>
Here's the thing. Ask any of the 24 hour game designers whether or not they feel that the games as "completed" (there are actually very, very few that have achieved the goal), are worthy of being published in the form that they exist in when "finished" at the end of 24 hours. Ask Phil Reed if he did any work on his entries before actually publishing them. He did. Lots.<br/>
<br/>
So...nobody running the contests expects publishable games as a result...the designers don't expect that the results will be publishable for play... moreover, other than as the results of the contest as a PDF to be reviewed, they don't publish them.<br/>
<br/>
If we've given the impression that this is what these contests are about, then... I guess we owe you an apology or something. But I don't think that this has ever been the intent. These contests are intended to get people to stretch their creative muscles, and, perhaps, to come up with some proto-designs that might eventually be worked into a format (including playtesting) that will make them worthy of being published.<br/>

                            Hey Mike:<br><br>Yeah, you're right about why I used "Complete"; as another way to say "Theoretically Playable", and not "a wankfest of an arthaus project that was deisgned for some other purpose than to be played". <br><br>There were only two such Arthaus entries to the 24 Hour RPG contest to my knowledge.<br><br>The first is Haiku by Jared Sorensen. And I only allowed it in because it was fucking funny, even a little refreshing.<br><br>The other was "Bobby is Special" (which you can only get by Googling it, joining the Yahoogroup and downloading the file from the Members section), which was not coincidentally the last time anonymous submissions were allowed. It was an 8 half-page large font game where you play a " 'tard ". There were really no rules, the thing was wholly unplayable, it was surprisingly well laid out, and the most memorable feature was the 1d10 chart to see how much of a " 'tard " you were. Neither Keeton nor I wanted to host the thing. There's a review of it at <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/11/11262.phtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/11/11262.phtml</a>.<br><br>I didn't want to turn the project into a million wannabees doing arthaus unplayable bullshit as aaaaaahrt. So I made an emphasis on "complete", so that people fall into line thinking, "OK, I can goof off and all, but in the end this has to be a game, not aaaaaahrt."<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Yeah, what surprises me is that we have to explicate any of this. That is, I didn't put out any disclaimer saying, "We're not trying to make games suitable for publishing!" because I really didn't think that anyone would think that's what we were about.<br/>
<br/>
I recall somebody asking something about this, maybe in the first contest. And my response was like, "Publish? After only one week of work? You must be mad! You wouldn't have time to work the bugs out of the text, much less playtest it."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Again, I think this is what Sandy's sorta saying. That we make some games that we don't intend to either publish nor play (though, in the context of the article he could he seen as saying that we are publishing them - and, in that they are available as PDFs, we are).<br/>
<br/>
Basically I don't think we're saying that people should play these games as finished for the contests, nor do I think Sandy is saying that we actually have the hubris to think that people should. No blood, no foul.<br/>
