Everyone in the audience seemed to engage reasonably with Sarah's talk, even if they didn't agree.  <br/><br/>Lizzie said to the Nordic larpers that they should write a book to explain what they've learned to others.  Similarly, we who have been punched in the face by Threefold arguments should communicate weaving and dodging (or perhaps facial bandaging) to others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373219/#Comment_373219" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-17T10:18:33+00:00" title="April 17, 2012 10:18AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>...Lizzie Stark's rant: "Write some fucking documentation", pointed squarely at Nordic larp</blockquote>\nI'd like to hear more about this.

He ran it in New Jersey in Intercon 13.5 (I think) in 1999. AND he was American!My best con-game ever, was with a classical GM in the hallway of GothCon, back in the early nineties. He was a swede.<br/><br/>I expect experiences like these criss-cross the whole world. The really great experience is often had when several un-known factors work together, to have a creative meeting with a game and gamers go into the extraordinary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373506/#Comment_373506" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T15:01:10+00:00" title="April 18, 2012  3:01PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm interested in making more explicit the minimal conditions for organising a short room larp.<br/><br/>My motivation is that I came away wanting to make this happen off my own back, and that seems doable to me in a way I hadn't considered before. At the same time, I recognise that the medium contains some pitfalls that aren't found in tabletop (for instance, GM hesitation about how to rule a decision is far more problematic in a real-time multiplayer context). Until very recently I'd always conceived of larp as a medium that demanded expertise and experience to work at all. Now I wonder if the bar is somewhat lower than that, given a group who are not paying to play but just keen to squeeze fun out of it.<br/><br/>It would be really useful if the larp community had placed a lens over their games to give attention to ease of running, especially for those more familiar with tabletop, and framed some guidance for new entrants. Is freeform far easier than plotted? Does heavy use of NPCs demand greater play fluency than one might expect? That sort of thing.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I think that I could now run <i>Playing with Intent</i> within my social network (granted that it contains a lot of improvisers).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373512/#Comment_373512" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T15:19:39+00:00" title="April 18, 2012  3:19PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alex, it is super interesting to me that one of the big blind spots I saw was the heavily hierarchical, top-down structure that is almost universal.

Virtually on rails, with some juicy moments of protagonism from time to time. However, I simply couldn't run the game as I experienced it - it depended heavily on the presence of an intimidating huge person screaming fluently at you in another language as you stood to attention! Even without the language games, Sergey was simply awesome at taking player contributions and using any sign of weakness or humanity to screw us up. I suppose it's not fundamentally different from MLWM... except it is, due to the real-time features and lack of support from textual,mechanical,or player contribution sources.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear if there is, for instance, a rule of thumb of playing a game at least once (twice?) before running it...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jiituomas" title="Jiituomas"><img alt="Jiituomas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jiituomas">Jiituomas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373562/#Comment_373562" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T00:23:54+00:00" title="April 19, 2012 12:23AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Such a rule of thumb isn't necessary, but it does help. Especially in the case of repeatable mini-larps with a central story arc. The running of those benefits a lot from having played the game, from knowing the script thoroughly, and from having some idea what various things players may end up doing during it. <br/><br/>1942: The Police is an excellent example of such, and I envy those who got to play it under Sergey's expert guidance. I've co-run it twice with very good GMs, but never played it myself. In contrast, my Tribunal has intentionally been written so that it does need much familiarity, and can be picked up even by people with no larp experience. While dealing with very similar topics, the two have almost totally different story-construction systems (and thus produce quite dissimilar experiences), and that's why their level of required active game-mastering (and thus familiarity with the game) are very different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg" title="StephaniePegg"><img alt="StephaniePegg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/185/n6ACKVL4YBWQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg">StephaniePegg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373565/#Comment_373565" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T00:42:55+00:00" title="April 19, 2012 12:42AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>...Lizzie Stark's rant: "Write some fucking documentation", pointed squarely at Nordic larp</blockquote>\nI'd like to hear more about this.

See for example the awesome Nordic Larp book, and some of the few previous Knudepunkt books.\n<blockquote>Tomas, I'm referring to the top-down larpwright-GM-bunch of players model that is well established, even if used for different goals ultimately.

I'm an outsider so I'm sure I have blind spots of my own but I really got a strong feeling of "this is how it is done because that's how we do it".</blockquote>\nI think there's one very clear methodological/tehnical reason for this: In a tabletop session all the players and the GM are present all the time, and everyone here's what other people are saying and how they're constructing the situation/world/characters/mood/etc. But a larp can be distributed over a huge area of land and time, with some players never even meeting each other. So if you're looking for a coherent world, this is the way you have to approach it. <br/><br/>Simple problems can arise for example, when some players set a house on fire. How can you communicate this to other players in a smooth way? Or somebody deciding that they're living in a monotheistic culture and somebody else simultaneously deciding that it's actually polytheistic or atheistic.<br/><br/>This topic, the construction of diegesis (or even diegeses), is talked about quite a bit, especially in some of the texts by Markus Montola and Jaakko Stenros.<br/><br/><br/>Another very important reason is that designing the world is often part of designing the larp in the first place. As with tabletops. To leave it up to the players would often be fairly pointless.<br/><br/><br/>This is not to say this hasn't been experimented with, by setting larps in abstract environments or directly telling the players to create the world with the game masters, and other experiments.

(Whereas a rulebook demystifies things to outsiders).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, a big barrier to entering most roleplay scenes is the jargon, which sounds highly technical and exclusionary. I felt frustrated when entering the Nordic scene in part because there was so much jargon, and no one seemed to be able to explain what the words meant to me in a concise way that allowed me to know what the heck was going on. Even terms that seemed very basic, like "larp" and "tabletop" had definitions different from what I'd encountered in the states, which caused me days of confusion. It also made me feel stupid and like I didn't belong there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, there are the Knutebooks, which go over some of this stuff, but they are pretty dense and academic, and being told that I have to read them to understand what is going on within this scene creates an even higher barrier to entry. (I have to read heavy game theory tomes? what?) If I hadn't been reporting for my book, (i.e. with a vested mission to get to the bottom of all this), I'm not sure I would have been able to continue.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the documentation side, I think there's a lot of basic descriptive work to be done. Nordic Larp does an awesome job of giving a sense of the games and their mechanics -- I thought it was accessible and really interesting. But I also think there is room for a play-by-play of how these gamers do things. We chose X mechanic because of Y. In the workshop, first we had the players do Q because of B and then we had them do R because of C. It seemed to work out well/poorly/etc. I know there's an increasing trend toward documenting games in this way and I think that's awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I'm just a non-native gamer new to the scene, but I'd like descriptive documentation that would allow me to lift techniques from some of these games, or even to re-run them. I'd love information that translates the foreign cultural context into one I understand. If I'd never played a jeepform game, I'd never be able to run one, because I haven't encountered information on how such a thing is done, and how it's different from more traditional tabletop.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And perhaps it goes without saying, but my rant was only half-serious.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373605/#Comment_373605" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T06:53:50+00:00" title="April 19, 2012  6:53AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to have a "rule book" for Danish semi-live freeform scenario play, too.

Moreso than other rants, people picked up on Lizzie's rant and I heard it repeated more.  (Also, it seems there were a lot of newcomers this year compared to my past experience - and I think they took up Lizzie's sentiment.)  <br/><br/>BTW, I would like to hear more about Jason Morningstar's rant.  <br/><br/>I would note that years ago there were some people who were pushing for collectively organized larps at Knutepunkt.  As I note in my <br/><a href="http://darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/cons/knutepunkt2005.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Knutepunkt 2005 Report</b></a>, there was discussion and a larp on "Collective Larp Organizing" by Martine Svanevik.  However, the crowd has since changed and I have heard less about it.  Still, I was in the "Playing With Intent" freeform this year that was collectively organized.  <br/><br/>There aren't any statistics as far as I know, but I think that most focus in the Nordic larp scene is on larger, funded, set-piece larps.  It is more common to publish small larps because those are more easily run by different groups, but most people I talked to concentrated more on the big, few-times-a-year larps.  For example, Jesper talked about how he pushed for smaller, more continuous small larps and/or workshops that incorporate feedback quickly, as opposed to big setpieces - but he phrased it as if he was speaking against the tide.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373642/#Comment_373642" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T11:12:13+00:00" title="April 19, 2012 11:12AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>BTW, I would like to hear more about Jason Morningstar's rant.</blockquote>\nThe central point of my rant was that Nordic larp is insular and self-assured and would benefit from exploring a wider scope of ideas.

My apologies!<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Hello all. I'm new to this forum, but enjoying this discussion so far.<br/><br/>I'd like to clarify my reasoning for using GNS(I) as an organizational framework for my Social Conflict and Bleed project, which featured 29 participants internationally:<br/><br/>1) In my talk, I included several caveats regarding the use of problematic terminology such as GNSI, creative agenda, immersion, bleed, etc. Those who were at the lecture can perhaps recall the amount of times I said the phrase, "Again, we can argue later about the meaning behind these terms, but for now, I am using them as placeholders." While we may not agree on the definitions of these terms or how often they apply to certain behaviors/mentalities, I don't think the answer is to stop using terms completely. We have to be able to discuss role-playing theory in some way, even though attempting to properly categorize and pinpoint such an ephemeral experience as role-playing is ultimately impossible.<br/><br/>2) Many of my participants, who included "average" players without organizational experiences, experienced game masters, game designers, and popular and scholarly "experts in the field" used these terms to discuss the behaviors of certain participants. I did not originally intend to include creative agenda or play styles in my work, but these issues emerged so strongly from the data that I needed to address them. For example, if someone discusses "railroading" or "rules lawyering," it makes sense to categorize these issues under Narrativism and Gamism from a purely logistical perspective. Regardless of whether we like these terms or not, they've filtered into the daily speech of many role-players. To ignore that these terms have meaning for those who use them would be, in my opinion, irresponsible as a researcher.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm open to suggestions for how best to categorize hundreds of pages of condensed research data into usable sections with a 5000-word limit. And no, "don't categorize at all," does not count as "usable," IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373651/#Comment_373651" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T11:54:47+00:00" title="April 19, 2012 11:54AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2012 11:56AM by David Artman.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sarah Lynne Bowman</cite>even though attempting to properly categorize and pinpoint such an ephemeral experience as role-playing is ultimately impossible</blockquote>... before breakfast. ;-)<br/><br/>I'll interject here that I believe it to tbe entirely possible, but only in context. That is, one set of taxonomy applies to play at the table/event, another to design considerations (to encourage/drive play), another to critical analysis post-play (i.e., what broke down? The RAW or the play expectations or both?).<br/><br/>Hence the slap-fest that was early GNS/GDS discussions: Different perspectives using the same terminology and not understanding how they couldn't agree. (I wrote <a href="http://davidartman.com/philosophy/the-degrees-of-being" rel="nofollow">paper</a> about how that sort of effect still happens even after centuries of philosophical taxonomy.)<br/><br/>Your best bet, then, to "condense" could be to first split the data by (say) design versus interpretive considerations; then perhaps by design objectives versus design techniques (and their parallels in play expectations and methods). Feel free to coin terms, too--too bad you're not German and can't just build a string of terms into a new word! But trying to take a term that is historically applied in multiple contexts--even with variant usage outside of gaming itself!--is a recipe for confusion. Perhaps, in your analysis, you see similarities to improv, literary criticism, or "Big-G" Game Theory (i.e., economics, sociology). GREAT... but don't appropriate their terms thinking you've found a shortcut. More than likely, you'll just drag in muddy connotations that you never intended (and can never fully scrape off the source terms).<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373653/#Comment_373653" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T12:06:15+00:00" title="April 19, 2012 12:06PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Sarah!!<br/><br/>Quick thoughts, most of which I've already mentioned but I'll write out: <br/><br/>1) People in the Forge and Story Games communities use "Narrativist" to mean specifically story-focused but <b>not</b> railroaded, GM-dominated, or traditional games.  Other people use "Narrativist" and "Dramatist" interchangeably to mean games focused on story.  <br/><br/>2) "Simulationist" originally was used for tabletop games that focused on simulation - i.e. having game results that matched expectations of what would really happen given the fictional situation.  It also was associated with immersion.  The Forge community used to use it for all of railroaded, traditional, as well as simulation-focused games - but I think that usage has died off.  <br/><br/>3) "Immersionist" is used mainly in the larp community for focus on staying in a purely in-character point of view.  It's not used much by the Story Games or tabletop communities.  <br/><br/>4) "Gamist" is generally the clearest, but it can mix up competitive and rule-focused behavior.  Someone can be rule-focused without being competitive and vice-versa.  <br/><br/>I can give links to lots of other models, but really none of them have gotten much traction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sarah%20Lynne%20Bowman" title="Sarah Lynne Bowman"><img alt="Sarah Lynne Bowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sarah%20Lynne%20Bowman">Sarah Lynne Bowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373655/#Comment_373655" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T12:10:06+00:00" title="April 19, 2012 12:10PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your response, David! I understand the confusion and appreciate your points. Unfortunately, I do not have enough space in a paper about social conflict in role-playing communities to take a detour into the many facets of RPG theory and their contexts. I'm looking for direct points that people can apply to their player groups and their own experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, problems listed under Narrativism include:<br/>\n<br/>\n-- when a player feels railroaded onto a particular narrative trajectory with little-to-no creative input into the game<br/>\n-- when an organizer constructs a well-sculpted plot and the players refuse to follow the plot points<br/>\n-- when players "hijack" the game away from the organizer's original intent <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I could simply remove the term "narrativism" and avoid categorizing these points at all, but I'm not sure that's entirely fruitful. Keep in mind that in a short paper such as this, I have one sentence max to define my terms, as the primary content pertains to social dynamics, not RPG theory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373659/#Comment_373659" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T12:26:56+00:00" title="April 19, 2012 12:26PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your presentation was very interesting, Sarah. It's refreshing to see data from actually speaking with participants, rather than speculation. John Kim's distinctions hit on the head what I was thinking about the use of GNS/GDS and Immersion in your paper. The Forge use of Narrativisim is, imo, the most specific and idiosyncratic of the terms. <br/><br/>It is interesting, though, that people use the terms and that these divisions arose from looking at the responses. In recent years, there is a general "strong read" that I've heard repeated that lumps D/S together under the "story focussed" camp. And the advocacy GDS terms seem most widely used. This makes sense in the nordic context--the John wrote up the Threefold Model in one of the early Nodal Point books. And these meanings are more oriented toward practice and procedure in a game (again, imo) as opposed to GNS that are oriented toward preference and orientation.<br/><br/>Ah, I hadn't noticed before that there was an adaptation of the Threefold Model for nordic larp:<br/><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/theory/threefold/faq_larp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/theory/threefold/faq_larp.html</a> <br/><br/>That replaces S with I.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_373663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373663/#Comment_373663" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T12:41:05+00:00" title="April 19, 2012 12:41PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lizziestark</cite>being told that I have to read them to understand what is going on within this scene</blockquote>People say all sorts of strange things.

That was actually how I was introduced to the scene.  Petter emailed me asking to adapt my FAQ for his essay in the 2003 Knudepunkt book, and it was from that introduction that I learned about Nordic larp and Knutepunkt.  <br/><br/>I think as far as terminology goes, there are at least two approaches.  One is the theoretical view, where one looks at key essays like my FAQ and/or Ron Edwards' GNS essays - and interprets them by "What did John and/or Ron really mean?"  The other is the practical view of going out and seeing how people use the words in practice.  i.e. When typical gamers use a term like "gamist" in discussion, what are they trying to express?  <br/><br/>The latter is Sarah's approach, and I think it is much more relevant for gamer culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373665/#Comment_373665" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T12:53:38+00:00" title="April 19, 2012 12:53PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Matthijs, John:</b> Thanks for the clarifications.

Gamism emphasizes rules, achievement, problem solving, and \u201cwinning\u201d the scenario when possible. <br/><br/>For the purposes of this paper, the simulationist stance refers to the goal of maintaining a realistic setting in terms of description, costuming, story, and character action. In this context, realism refers to adherence to the established genre or fictional space and does not necessarily imply social realism. <br/><br/>While the definition of immersion is open for debate (Torner &amp; White, 2012), for the purposes of this paper, immersionism describes seeking to think and feel as the character in the moment within the game world.</blockquote>\nI understand that I'm merging theories here, but I wanted to be able to identify issues that loosely fall into these overall categories. If you have different language to suggest, I'm all ears, but I'm not inclined to reinvent the wheel, so to speak, by introducing newly invented terminology to describe the same thing that has been discussed before. Also, as John pointed out, many of my participants used terms like "gamist" and "simulationist" in an offhand matter, which complicates the issue.<br/><br/>Also, I tend to agree with Lizzie's puzzlement regarding the arguments surrounding these terms. I know there is a long-standing history involved in this debate and I don't wish to position myself within it. The terms are out there and are in use, as are bleed, immersion, the magic circle, and other "fuzzy" terms. I think it's more useful to define them for the purposes of the current project, admit the flaws with any one term, and move on rather than get mired in debate, but I know I'm in the minority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373692/#Comment_373692" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T14:49:13+00:00" title="April 19, 2012  2:49PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lizzie - description from your blog post seems spot-on for the Threefold model, but there is a nuance missing for Ron's GNS theory.  This difference is important to most later argumentation.  <br/><br/>In Ron's GNS version, many gamers who think of themselves as thoroughly into "story" are still considered Simulationist.  Basically, all traditional tabletop RPGs (i.e. the state of design prior to 2000) are considered Simulationist regardless of how the game or players emphasize story.  So, for example, a Vampire: The Masquerade group that consciously organize their chronicle around particular planned themes are still considered Simulationist.  Narrativist is generally reserved for games following Forge/Story Games-related schools of design.  <br/><br/>Back to Knutepunkt...

This is really interesting. In the Nordic tradition the usage of the GNS model came in the late 1990s from John's article, and has apparently been living a life totally different from the one it had in the Forge community. Both groups probably reframed and redefined it to further their own goals. For example, for me railroading a tabletop game is clearly a narrativist technique. And simulationist larps are often closest to tabletops in that the costumes can be almost irrelevant. The idea of creating a 360 illusion is something completely different, not really defined by GNSI.<br/><br/>I think Petter Bockmann's translation of John's GNS model for larp was published online waaaaay before 2003. The 2003 Knudepunkt book was the first one, and collected all the influential texts in one place with appropriate commentary. They included Dogme 99, the Manifesto of the Turku School, and Petter's version of GNS. Probably some others, as well.<br/><br/>I think when I wrote the Turku Manifesto over twelve years ago for Solmukohta 2000, I specifically wanted to comment on the GNS model (as presented by both John and Petter), and criticize Narrativism and Gamism in tabletops and larps. I'm not sure, but I think the word immersionism was coined for the manifesto as an alternative to G, N and S. (Although I also approved of Simulationism. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> The Manifesto was discussed, opposed and replied to alot, so at least some of its terminology still remains. (But many of those terms were already in wide usage at the time in more or less this context.)<br/><br/>But any later Forge usage of these terms has clearly made them into completely different beasts. So I can understand why Lizzie would have a hard time trying to define them!

Walton</cite><b>Mike:</b>Doesn't a lot of Nordic larp take place more on the "parlor larp" scale (like 20 people or less) rather than the mega-larp scale? I'm really confused then about why the top-down authoritarian management is necessary.  If you write a larp for, like, 8 people, it becomes much easier to maintain "shared imaginary space," yeah?</blockquote>\nNot really, but definitely some. The problem rises more from the aesthetics of uninterrupted play. Say you're playing in a three person parlor larp where all the characters are siblings. One of them is reading the Bible and two others are talking in the corner. They talk about their paternal grandmother and decide her name was Alice. Meanwhile the third one has seen the name Miriam in the Bible, and decides that's the name of their paternal grandmother. She closes the Bible, and goes to the other two starting a discussion about their paternal grandmother Miriam. They're confused, clearly her name's Alice. No, it can't be, since there's no Alice in the Bible! As you can see, these kinds of problems would inevitably rise all the time. And they do rise, and sometimes they're fairly easy to solve, but they don't really make the experience any better.<br/><br/>In most Nordic Larps it's considered ideal if the GM doesn't need to interrupt or disrupt the game in any way while its running. If your character needs to call the police, you can tabletop the discussion with the GM, and they'll figure something out, but the GM would probably never stop the game to give everyone off-game information. (I don't know if this is different from larps in other countries, but with tabletops the barrier between ingame and offgame is obviously much more fluid.)<br/><br/><br/>BUT! There's plenty of tradition of doing this BEFORE the game. For example, the larpwright giving only the vaguest of setting for the players, who then gather in groups and workshop the culture and traditions of their faction. That's been done for a long time, but I'm sure there's also larps that have directly been influenced by (say) My Life With Master and other important Forge games in developing these techniques. In inside:outside, Eirik Fatland and I would give everyone a character description that had a profession, a character flaw and ideological stance. All the rest was left up to the individual players, and we'd ask them a series of questions they had to answer: What's your name? Where are you from? Do you have a family? What did you do yesterday?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373776/#Comment_373776" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T01:14:22+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  1:14AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just in case people didn't see it: The Solmukohta crew just tweeted this.<br/>\n<blockquote>INFO FOLLOWING: Solmuflu is Influenza A, which explains why some of us developed viral, others bacterial pneumonia and others no pneu at all<br/>If you're ill, get checked out, you might be a danger to old people, pregnant ladies, the obese and ppl w/ pre-existing heart/lung problems.<br/>Also: you may be contagious for 2 weeks.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Post-Solmukohta 2012: The Idea Percolation - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16337/post-solmukohta-2012-the-idea-percolation/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Post-Solmukohta 2012: The Idea Percolation - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16337/post-solmukohta-2012-the-idea-percolation/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I got your percolation right here: I just submitted two events for Gen Con.

Initially (or earlier) they were written for 4 players. They they went up to 5, now commonly include 6. The interaction with GM is generally strong during play (introducing fiction, framing scenes), though it also seems common for the GM to watch and keep play on target rather than interacting a lot with the players. There is a strong emphasis among players on keeping the flow of immersion (or El\xe4ytyjism?) during play. This is a strong difference between jeepform GMing and even more so with tabletop play. <br/><br/>Nordic LARPs, as opposed to freeform &amp; live play, seem more oriented toward larger groups of players, often with large groups of NPCs or assistant players/organizers. <br/><br/>I'm looking forward to reading Lizzie's book, so I can get cracking on analyzing and theorizing about US larp as well. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373802/#Comment_373802" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T07:42:24+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  7:42AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn you, Morningstar...

Alternately, you can check Shade's LARP List, but it's currency is patchy.<br/><br/>Generally, however, US (non-convention) LARPs are long-running, whether boffer or parlor--that is: full action with or without additional systems, or system simulated, including freeform 'systems'. Finding a one-off outside of a convention could be quite tricky.<br/><br/>That said, contact some of the long-running game hosts and see if they could let you participate in an NPC capacity, or as a "cameo" character. Pitch yourself well (i.e., a scholar from the Land of Jeepform, wanting to learn the "US Way") and you probably won't be charged to play one or two events--charges usually go toward paperwork and maintenance of character data, and you shouldn't require that. Note that most parlor LARPs are one or two evenings a week (if not 24/7), while boffer LARPs tend to run Friday night to Sunday afternoon. The latter might charge you a nominal fee no matter what, as they might have venue charges to offset.<br/><br/>Go for it, I say!

Using miniatures to represent complex tactical situations would be a third fairly common one in tabletop, and the groups I play in often use small cards with NPC's faces to represent complex social situations. In my experimental indie RPG The Hand of Gulliver the Man-Mountain (<a href="http://mikepohjola.com/turku/Gulliver.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF</a>) the players use their fingers to represent their characters and the back of the GM's hand is the location.<br/><br/>That's the scale in tabletops. And sometimes you get stuff mixed up, and when people are talking out of character, you assume it's in character or they want to take something back later and you can retcon or fastforward etc.<br/><br/>In my experience, larps are usually much more rigid in that the aim is to play your character from beginning to end with no breaks and no changes in playing style and never going out of character (unless someone's in real danger or something). This has also been experimented on, of course, but I'd say a bit less than with tabletops, since it can be very disruptive. One great thing I remember was the three-day larp Hamlet in 2003 in Stockholm, where the ordinary playing would stop every now and then, and all the characters would gather around one NPC/actor who would perform one of the famous monologues. This would represent each character's inner monologue, so we were essentially watching our own thoughts being performed at us. After the monologue the normal playing would resume, but some characters might be changed by their interpretation of the monologue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373856/#Comment_373856" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T12:56:39+00:00" title="April 20, 2012 12:56PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2012 12:56PM by catty_big.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

Emily, Jason, and Evan gave a talk / demo where they introduced a bunch of "peer empowered tabletop roleplay" - matching the essay in the Solmukohta 2012 book ("Beyond the Game Master").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373881/#Comment_373881" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T16:31:16+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  4:31PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alex Fradera was our UK anchor.<br/><br/>I only talked to one person who reflexively dismissed tabletop in general, and met a ton of people who were really interested and asked for recommendations (if I promised you a curated list, holler!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373885/#Comment_373885" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T17:54:15+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  5:54PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2012 5:59PM by catty_big.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: jhkim<br/>What do you mean by the "indie scene" here? <br/>I think what I mean is, er, you know, um, what's, what's the word now?

There's a few actives in Finland, but not many.<br/><br/>However, all games published in Finland (not sure of the other Nordic countries) would be indie in some sense. Many are self-published or by small publishers, most are stand-alones with no supplements, and typically each has their own game mechanics designed for that particular game.<br/><br/>That said, I think most tabletop games played over here are based on D&amp;D, GURPS, WHFRP, WoD and other big American games. It's difficult to guess how the majority of gamers (those who don't discuss their games on forums, magazines or cons) play, but it seems like most of the active ones are heavily influenced by ideas from Nordic Larp, Forge/US indie, jeepform, OSR, and random sources (art theory, TED talks, AR, web apps, performance art...) even when basing their campaign on more traditional sources. (Sometimes the influx of new ideas is, of course, preceded by misunderstandings, wars between factions and hating all the new stuff.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_373966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373966/#Comment_373966" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T14:00:42+00:00" title="April 21, 2012  2:00PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2012 2:07PM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Pohjola</cite>That said, I think most tabletop games played over here are based on D&amp;D, GURPS, WHFRP, WoD and other big American games.</blockquote>I would say that was true for Norway too, ten years ago. But now I have the impression a lot of groups have started exploring other games, and those groups are the ones recruiting new players to the hobby. The typical D&amp;D group is not as interesting when talking about Norwegian role-playing, and neither as dominant  in our culture anymore; they do not recruit. So I do not believe that picture holds true any more. New games from abroad, and by our own designers, are more interesting.<br/><br/>There are changes afoot, and as always; our understanding of them lags a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Initially (or earlier) they were written for 4 players. They they went up to 5, now commonly include 6.</blockquote>\nDuring the 90ies, the organisers requested that scenarios had 6 player characters. Due to the tradition of having one group per room and a typical Fastaval location offering at most 30 rooms suitable for play, having more players per group meant having more people playing. This strict requirement lead to the concept of the 6th PC which did not fit in the fiction. The requirement of 6 players per group has long since been abandoned.

Due to the tradition of having one group per room and a typical Fastaval location offering at most 30 rooms suitable for play, having more players per group meant having more people playing. This strict requirement lead to the concept of the 6th PC which did not fit in the fiction. The requirement of 6 players per group has long since been abandoned.

June 21-24 in Orange County, California.<br/><br/>The convention features a particularly broad range of events and panels. Live combat games, one-shot parlor larps, ARG experiments, academic panels, craft workshops (both acting craft and making things), a vendor room, and all sorts of other activities happening.<br/><br/>I know Sarah and Lizzie are planning to be there. I hope to see many others as well.<br/><br/>www.wyrdcon.com<br/><br/>Throwing that out there as a way of noting that academic larp symposiums (with praxis) are happening in the US as well. Sure, it's still in relatively early stages compared to the well developed Nordic scene, but it's off to a very respectable start. And I think it's a wonderfully healthy thing that the WyrdCon convention attracts an extremely diverse crowd. Sure, it means that the density of people who are there to get into awesome theory discussions is reduced. But it also means that the community is being developed in a way that feels particularly inclusive and non-exclusionary. At least, that's the hope.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374195/#Comment_374195" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T08:20:16+00:00" title="April 24, 2012  8:20AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And for those of you can't make it to WyrdCon, we have the East Coast conversation happening as well at <a href="http://www.interactiveliterature.org/M/" rel="nofollow">Intercon Metamorphosis</a>.

Just like the creative agenda terms are. Some people define them a specific way. Others use them to mean something similar but different.<br/><br/>Usually freeform means that a game is extremely light on structured mechanics. No hit points. No objects to trade. No structured jeepform techniques like monologue and bird-in-ear. Lots of talking in character.<br/><br/>What else it means depends on who is saying the word to whom.<br/><br/>Sometimes it means the GMs don't do much after the game starts. Other times it means that conflict is resolved by GM fiat, so the GMs actually have a lot to do.<br/><br/>Sometimes it means that there's a super duper simple conflict resolution mechanic that resolves anything that can't be resolved by just talking. Like one round of rock-paper-scissors and that's it.<br/><br/>Sometimes it means that players can set scenes and move the action wherever they want. Sometimes it means that the game is closed within a set location so this doesn't happen. Sometimes it means GMs have to be called over to set a scene that's different from the default location.<br/><br/>It means different things to different groups. I'm pretty sure I haven't listed all the differences, but that's a fair chunk of them from the top of my head.<br/><br/>It's easier to identify things that are not freeform:<br/><br/>Pretty much everything about one of the 1000+ player fantasy live combat larps in Europe is not freeform. High mapping of player action to character action. High mapping of physical space to game world space. Low PC creative input outside the limits of being their character and doing what the character would do (you can't, for example, invent a new country off the top of your head just by talking about it - setting documentation of done by the GMs). Very structured mechanics interactions - if you touch someone with a foam sword that does hit point damage to their character, for example. High mapping of costume cues to character information - if someone has a mouse half-mask on their face and fur glued to the back of their hands, you can assume they are from the race of mouse people - if they don't have any indicators like that, you can assume they aren't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374737/#Comment_374737" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T11:42:44+00:00" title="April 27, 2012 11:42AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Just a request from the sideline - but could the discussion on the definition on freeform continue in a separate thread?
