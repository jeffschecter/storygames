I wanted to tell you guys about it and field any questions you may have about AfroFuture. Here's the pitch \u2026<br/><br/><i>Inspired by P-Funk mythology and Ishmael Reed\u2019s fiction, AfroFuture is a tabletop role-playing game about the war for the narrative of human history. In our corner, representing art and freedom, is the Mothership: a transdimensional soul machine crewed by historical luminaries and culture heroes born from your favorite songs. In that corner, representing patriarchy and dystopia, is the Man: a mysterious entity wrought from the evil in every human heart.<br/><br/>He\u2019s recruited the past\u2019s worst villains\u2014from Andrew Jackson to Bal Thackeray to Vivian James\u2014to command his forces and to suborn the will of the people. His machinations are already underway, not only in the present, past, and future, but also in the parallel worlds represented by your favorite RPGs. It is up to you, as AfroFuture operatives, to bring the noise and the funk to any place, any time, and any RPG system which suffers the Man\u2019s depredations.<br/><br/>AfroFuture gives us a creative, cathartic, and galvanizing means of exploring frustration with the social ills which weaken our hobby. Music figures prominently in the game: every player character has a song about them, and the fiction interfaces with music playing at your real-world table. If you want a setting which places minority experience front and center, this game will hook you up.</i><br/><br/>One last thing: while supplies last, I'm inviting anyone who backs Different Play at $12 or higher to collaborate with me on a character from one of their favorite songs, for inclusion in the final version of the game. Sounds fun, right?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441496/#Comment_441496" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-14T18:26:02+00:00" title="January 14, 2015  6:26PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2015 6:26PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Music figures prominently in the game: every player character has a song about them, and the fiction interfaces with music playing at your real-world table.</blockquote>\nOK, I need to hear more about this bit, like, yesterday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441574/#Comment_441574" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-16T13:30:18+00:00" title="January 16, 2015  1:30PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you talk about cultural appropriation and how you address it or don't?

I will answer them one at a time.\n<blockquote><blockquote>Music figures prominently in the game: every player character has a song about them, and the fiction interfaces with music playing at your real-world table.</blockquote>OK, I need to hear more about this bit, like, yesterday.</blockquote>\nMusic carries transcendental power in AfroFuture. Much of the Mothership's technology relies on the Funkentelechy, a universal ur-soul which some theorists identify with Indra's net or with the Akashic record. It manifests in the consciousness of AfroFuturists as the universe's own soundtrack, and they can send thought or energy to other awakened heads through their own soul music. Have you ever, in real life, gotten a really good song stuck in your head, then realized that you've never actually heard the song before? That phenomenon is evidence that the Mothership or its crew have passed near you, cutting through the real world on their way to a mission site.<br/><br/>Composed as it is of the music in all humans, the Funkentelechy also brings forth culture heroes. The existence of a song about a certain character is often evidence that a heroic incarnation of the character exists in one of the realms which the Funkentelechy pervades; and it is the job of Fran\xe7ois-Dominique Toussaint l'Ouverture, AfroFuture's General of Human Resources, to track down these characters using the Mothership's Peek-a-Groove Sensor Array and invite them aboard the Mothership to join the battle against the Man.<br/><br/>I've been fiddling with a few different mechanics for integrating table music with the game. I'm loath to make them indispensable\u2014it wouldn't do to exclude deaf players, or players who can't concentrate on the game if music is playing\u2014but one idea I had was to create a playlist based on a combination of the <a href="https://plus.google.com/115409979050506121662/posts/fCqjwqhAfh9" rel="nofollow">AfroFuture mediography,</a> certain tracks representing the Man, and the theme songs or source music of the characters in play. When your AfroFuturist's song comes up on shuffle, you get some kind of mechanical bonus (free tags in Fate, replace your highest die in any pool with a d20 in Cortex+, etc.) that lasts the duration of your song, within reason. Something like that! More playtesting needed.<br/><br/>Ishmael Reed's presentation of jazz as a nascent loa in <i>Mumbo Jumbo</i> was one of the major influences on this idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441630/#Comment_441630" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-17T23:22:25+00:00" title="January 17, 2015 11:22PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">@DiscoSoup</a>, what do you mean by "background"?

It's a low/high spectrum.

I think culture divides people more than it brings them together, and that culture is too often used as an excuse for inappropriate behavior.

I guess it mostly depends on the contents of their songs, but each of these represent a definite press against what could be considered the machinations of the Wallflower Order.

Among the sample characters I bring to conventions are Hu\u0101 M\xf9l\xe1n, who comes from a traditional ballad; the Black Beetle, from various capoeira <i>corridos;</i> and Scheherazade, from the Rimsky-Korsakov symphonic poem of her name.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Niko">@Niko</a>, I will listen to some Gogol Bordello! One of the things I love about this project is how much new and exciting media it's introduced to me. As far as gender diversity goes: I'm planning some different playsets for AfroFuture which marry a traditional RPG setting to a set of identity and social justice issues. For example, <b>the Dungeon Industrial Complex</b> uses fantasy dungeon-crawling to explore racism and the prison system; and <b>the Difference Engine</b> uses steampunk to explore classism, colonialism, and technocracy. I'm hoping to focus on gender, sexuality, and ability in <b>Trans*Human,</b> a cyberpunk setting which songs like "Cherry Lips" (and pretty much everything else on <i>beautifulgarbage)</i> will fit very, very well.<br/><br/>Villains are definitely fair game for the Mothership. I really like the intra-party tension and doubt they can create. AfroFuture prefers to have these dangerous characters under their own roof, if for no reason other than to prevent them causing trouble for others. For example, Stagger Lee has appeared as a PC in every single AfroFuture game I've run so far. The story goes that one day the Devil telephoned the Mothership complaining that a gambler with an expensive suit, an even more expensive hat, and a Smith &amp; Wesson Triple Lock had showed up in Hell and taken his job. AfroFuture's North American regional director, el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz, grudgingly offered Stag a job as an AfroFuture operative to get the guy out of Hell. El-Shabazz sees a lot of Malcolm Little in Stagger Lee, though; so he watches Stag like a hawk, waiting to come down hard on him for any sign of his old ways re-emerging.<br/><br/>\u2026 and then there's the story of the AfroFuturist who went rogue, Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin \u2026.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441924/#Comment_441924" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-23T01:01:49+00:00" title="January 23, 2015  1:01AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've pledged at the 12 dollar level, so I'm putting serious thought into the matter.

Outside of the scope of appropriation, how does the game handle matters of race, both between players and within the game? I'm reminded of a recent FB post about a feminist RPG where heroes are only women, and how that went over like a lead balloon. Can the Mothership take in white, Asian, and/or Hispanic characters? Are there any black folk working for the Man? (I don't know if there's a right or wrong answer to that, but just curious.)<br/><br/>2) I love it when RPGs have rules that reinforce the game's themes and tone. Does the game have any rules, mechanics, or whatnot that reinforce embracing art, music, and freedom verses the Man's dystopic ideals?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441993/#Comment_441993" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-25T10:25:31+00:00" title="January 25, 2015 10:25AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great questions, <a href="/forums/profile/wjmacguffin">@wjmacguffin</a>! Gonna answer one at a time.<br/><br/>1) AfroFuture makes conversations about race, both in- and out-of-character, basically inevitable. I have embraced this truth and hopefully so will the players. By default, all AfroFuturists have their <b>race</b> and their <b>class</b> represented on their character sheets. In Fate they're Aspects and in Cortex+ they're Distinctions, and they can help or hinder you just like any other Aspect or Distinction. You have to think critically and carefully about how your race and class affect your role-playing and your chances of success at coldcocking a corrupt cop or convincing a crowd to adopt your protest slogan\u2014while the Man plays into existing negative stereotypes and expectations to use those same traits against you, inflicting racism or sexism or homophobia damage and stress on you the way that other games have bludgeoning/piercing/slashing damage or physical/mental/social stress. The game text is gonna be pretty heavy with discussions and exercises on how to have these kinds of conversations frankly and productively, especially for gamers who are new to talking about social issues while they game.<br/><br/>Given AfroFuture's focus on racism and its discontents, persons of color are the default on the Mothership. However, white characters are present and welcome among both AfroFuture operatives and the PsychoAlphaDiscoBetaElderNauts who direct them. For example, among the ElderNauts, the Mothership's poet laureate is Aleksandr Sergeyevich Pushkin, her Central American regional director is Sister Juana In\xe9s de la Cruz OSH, her Caribbean regional director is Audre Lorde, and her European regional director is Alexandre Dumas <i>p\xe8re.</i><br/><br/>There are Blacks and other persons of color working for the Man, but a combination of attrition and institutional racism keep their numbers comparatively low. Those who stay are encouraged to use cosmetics and other tools to bring their appearance more in line with the governing corporate ideal. Still, the Man prides himself on his ability to suborn and co-opt members of the same cultures on which he feeds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442007/#Comment_442007" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-25T20:33:22+00:00" title="January 25, 2015  8:33PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2) The game operates on a musical paradigm. Every AfroFuture character comes from a song which gave them life as a culture hero\u2014see my response to <a href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">@Joe_McGuffin</a> above for details on how that song might work out-of-character. Art is also your basic means for interacting with the world. Instead of skills, Approaches, or Roles, AfroFuture characters have <b>elements:</b> Breaker, DJ, MC, Writer, Past, and Future. The first four elements are the Four Elements of Hip Hop; the last two represent the time-traveling AfroFuturist's connection to ideas from the past or the future. So your character's capabilities are understood in terms of their connection to artistic disciplines; and every character is an artist, even if they didn't start out that way. You roll with one of these for any given action, with the player getting to choose if an action falls under two.<br/><br/>Breaker: dance | acrobatics | athletics | martial arts<br/>DJ: turntables | orchestration | production | tech | magic | leadership<br/>MC: rap | vocals | verbal expression and influence | public speaking<br/>Writer: graffiti | visual arts | written expression | academics | stealth<br/>Past: instinct | tradition | senses | strength | endurance<br/>Future: iconoclasm | innovation | revolution | progress | personal freedom<br/><br/>So, for example, Avatar Korra's elements would be:<br/>Breaker \u246b | DJ \u2465 | MC \u2465 | Writer \u2465 | Past \u2469 | Future \u2469                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442011/#Comment_442011" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-26T00:20:22+00:00" title="January 26, 2015 12:20AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is Ritchie Havens in the game already?

The list struck me with bad chords, culminating in this worrisome paragraph.<br/><br/>"If the answer to any of these questions is \u201cyes,\u201d you might be looking at cultural appropriation. In short, cultural appropriation is cultural exchange where you\u2019re a jerk about it."<br/><br/>How is this different than ignoring impact? Exchange is mutual, and you've made it clear you're not part of the culture, and I know that not wanting to be a jerk about it doesn't mean I'm not going to step on anyone's toes.<br/><br/>You mention perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. But what of the perpetuation of positive or mixed stereotypes? The culture of origin doesn't seem to be involved, and you might be making "bank" by some definition.<br/><br/>I ask these loaded questions because a little later, the attitude you express is right on:<br/><br/>"I made a lot of mistakes along the way, I am sorry for them, and I doubt I\u2019ve made my last. But I keep trying. It\u2019s that or quit."<br/><br/>This is a much stronger and open attitude. <br/><br/>It's not about being a jerk or not. That can't be the measurement.<br/><br/>All of us are jerks; the only difference is to what extent we're jerks, what extent we're aware of it, and what we do with our meat machines to measure survival and satisfaction with the consequent changes we perpetrate into the world.<br/><br/>But I think more to the point, why adopt the specifically African-American cultural phenomena of Afrofuturism? <br/><br/>It's a remarkable movement, I agree. But as an outsider (to both the African-American experience, but all person of color experiences), I could never hope to try and explain it. The best I could do is explain the concepts that it lifts in me. I love the breakdown of perception and assumptions, the call to action, the embrace of a better future through science and reason and technology, the permission to live life as true to myself as I can find in any moment, the rhythm, the style, the opposition to consistently unjust and unfair and white male dominated civil authority.<br/><br/>It seems you unnecessarily risk being a jerk by basing the entire game on the experience of a rather specific culture, when the concepts explored are universal. To put another way, Mark Dery might be a white-dude who invented the term, but he did it through interviewing three luminaries in what he perceived to be a united movement, and the fact that it caught on has more to do with those who followed that perception.<br/><br/>Maybe this is just a long way to say that even as a fan of Afrofuturism, I am put off by a game using that name by someone who doesn't get to decide whether or not its appropriation. If you can't tell, then how can it be an exchange?<br/><br/>I'd much rather play a game that is about your experience as an outsider, and the power and home to be found in counter-cultural movements, whether or not we can own them. This adds something new. This adds your personal expression. This creates the basis for an exchange of ideas.<br/><br/>Even if that results in a game that's mostly the same, where Afrofuturism dominates and West Africa is the cortex of the mythology, it will at least be a unique and personal expression that honestly attempts an exchange. It may still hurt. You may still end up a jerk. But the root of it is you, and your root is always based in the mutable now. If you base your root entirely in a history, or someone else's definition, you'll eventually end up perpetrating pain and jerky attitudes that were invisible to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442919/#Comment_442919" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-15T23:25:52+00:00" title="February 15, 2015 11:25PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know <a href="/forums/profile/Lula">@Lula</a> and fully expect that he will do awesome things with this game, but I still think that was a fantastic post, Jogesh (I can't "@" you because S-G stopped supporting spaces in usernames after the Vanilla upgrade).<br/><br/>Personally, if I were to make a game about action to embrace a better future, the breakdown of perception and assumptions, the opposition to unjust authority, and the permission to live authentically, I don't know how I could avoid roping in inspirations and influences from cultures other than mine.

Doing your best by one measure says nothing about the other, and even the best interpretations still could be compared to direct transmission or complete reimagining.  <a href="/forums/profile/Lula">@Lula</a>, I personally don't see anything in your G-Doc to dislike, but I do see how it skips important bases for those readers who are more concerned with the game's impact than with the author's attitude.<br/><br/>It might be good to spell out for folks:<br/>- What you imagine the pros and cons of <i>actual play</i> will be, w.r.t. cultural appropriation.<br/>- Why you have chosen to give "Mendez's take on Afrofuturism" as opposed to (a) "Mendez's take on future hope, assumption breakdowns, authentic living, and opposing injustice" or (b) the words of Ishmael Reed and others, directly.<br/><br/>I suspect you have good answers for these!  Maybe they're already present in the G-Doc to some degree, but calling them out more explicitly might be worth it.<br/><br/>Regarding this:\n<blockquote>The culture of origin doesn't seem to be involved</blockquote>I'd be really curious to see what happened if you reached out to Reed and some other influences for their input!  I'd say that even, "I'm not really interested, but your project has my blessing," would be worth something.  And who knows?  Maybe Chuck D or somebody will be all over it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443494/#Comment_443494" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-01T04:31:20+00:00" title="March  1, 2015  4:31AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">@DiscoSoup</a>, since you mentioned him I got a few Ritchie Havens albums and rather liked them; is there a particular piece you'd recommend?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
