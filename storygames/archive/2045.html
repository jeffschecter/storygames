                    Gulp! Tonight's the night! I'm running Njord, my Norse Sorcerer-game. We've been through one-sheet, Humanity definition, chargen (they made some very exciting characters with equally exciting and rather powerful demons to boot) and I've made a relationship map, a good list of Bangs - hell, I even drew a friggin' map. <br/>
But all the same, I feel a bit nervous. I know that playing Sorcerer will not make the heavens open and angels descend upon our little playing group, but all the same, I feel a certain pressure. I'm unsure if I've prepped enough - and well enough. I'm unsure if I get all the mechanics right. Overall, I'm just a tiny bit nervous that I'll fumble. Badly.<br/>
Any one else had that experience? And how did it go?<br/>

                            Hey Peter,<br/>
<br/>
I already sent you a whisper, but I thought of one more thing....<br/>
<br/>
The back of the character sheet. You guys filled it out for all the players, right?<br/>
<br/>
What I would recomend doing is making photocopies of the back of the sheet (or reproduce the element the player wrote down on seperate sheets -- shouldn't take too long.)<br/>
<br/>
Keep them with you. During the game, whenever your mind starts to wander, or your afraid you don't know what to do (whether it's because you just had a great scene and don't know what to do, or just had a calm scene that was fine but didn't add much and don't know what to do!) just look down at the backs of the sheets and let the Supporting Characters, Objects, Events, Institutions and anything else there slam your brain for a moment for inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
Some more thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
â€¢ Back in the day, GMing for me was being a personal party-clown hopped up whatever drugs kids take these days -- always keeping myself talking and engaging them, never letting them have a dull moment.<br/>
<br/>
Not so much anymore. The players are part of the mix, too. And if I'm just babbling the whole time they'll never get a chance to know that.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, those little moments, like I suggested above when you look at the character sheets, require a <i>moment</i> to actually let inspiration have some breathing room. So, don't rush. If you ask the Player a question about something and the player is stuck, don't always go for that GM trick of, "If you don't do something quick you're gonna die!" Just give him a moment and see if he doesn't smile and say something really cool. And give yourself the same luxery every once in a while as well.<br/>
<br/>
â€¢ Random notes:<br/>
- If a Bang feels like it's too much too soon, it probably is.<br/>
- If you're <i>afraid</i> a Bang is too much too soon, it probably isn't<br/>
- Don't be afraid to take your time, especially at the beginning. You'll have several sessions, and the first <i>Sorcerer</i> session is often a chance for the Players to pick up all the cool pieces you guys have built, turn them around a bit, and start "naming" the ones they are most intrigued with. It'll pick up pace...<br/>
- You're not there to <i>entertain</i> or to GM "right." You're there to engage in creative acts springboarded off shared imaginative elements you created as a group (Humanity definition, Demons, Price, Cover, Lore, the Kicker) Whenever you get stuck (if you ever do), circle back to those elements in regard to a Protagonist (which are all on the back of the characcter sheet and bring them into play.<br/>
- The cycle of <i>Sorcerer</i> is based on the Humanity rolls. If you can tie the imaginitive just mentioned into scenes that steer toward a Humanity driven choice, you've got gold. If you're group keeps generating Humanity rolls based off moments and scene material from the Humanity definition, Demons, Price, Cover and Lore, and the Kicker, you're probably having a great time, with a lot of leaning in and smiles and cringes from the players. And remember, the players will should and will be happily taking a hand in steering their Protagonists toward the Humanity rolls as well.<br/>

                            Pedyo, two bits of advice:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Don't have a plot in mind.  I once had a "half-plot"-- okay, in the last scene, the enemy army shows up outside the city.  And in the very first scene, a player was like, "I get my troops together and attack the enemy army in <i>their</i> city.  And I said, "Nope."  (In part because I was surprised, and in part because no, the war happens in the final scene, everyone knows that.)<br/>
<br/>
This was wrong of me.<br/>
<br/>
If your players say something that surprises you, roll with it.  Ditch your plot, and ask for a little bit of time to think.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Fights are hugely important in Sorcerer.  So are rituals.  <i>These aren't something you do casually</i>.  Slow down.  Ask everyone to get involved, suggesting details, strategies, colorful things to do, swashbuckling maneuvers, etc.  By slowing down, you give these scenes extra importance.  Also, the players get a chance to "prep" by adding in other scenes, setting up the ritual or getting the right kind of sacrificial virgin.  This will give a roll-over bonus.  It also makes the story richer and more complex.                        </div>

                            My players just left after a fine session that established the mood and moved the story and the characters along. As I suspected, one player character is simply more interesting than the other - mostly due to a more interesting demon and more persons around him. We felt our way along and without things exploding there were a few rather fine scenes. I wasn't too nervous and tried to let everything breathe. I feel that I need to get the players more involved in what happens and that I need to have a few more breath-taking scenes happen. I also need to get them closer to the center of the relationship map, where all the fun and juicy bits are hiding. I'll have to think very hard about good Bangs for next time.<br>
Thanks for all your advise. Mostly, it made me more relaxed I think. I'll keep it in mind prepping and playing next session.<br>

                            Hi Peter,<br/>
<br/>
Given a bunch of threads that have been popping up of late, the fact that you were relaxed is a really cool thing!<br/>
<br/>
Would you have time to post the PCs and Demons? In particular, and I know this sounds insane, is there any way to get photos posted of the back of the character sheets? Or reproductions of them?<br/>
<br/>
I ask because I'm realizing that what <i>I</i> mean by Actual Play isn't what everyone else means by Actual Play. I'm trying to be really specific about this. And what I mean by Actual Play is:<br/>
<br/>
1) What is the game (<i>Sorcerer, got it!</i>)<br/>
2) What is actually on the actual character sheets (which are, the only tangible clues the GM is working from)<br/>
3) What kind of Prep in hard notes the GM has (even if this is just an overview)<br/>
4) What incident occurred in play -- and how did they intersect wih the rules (keeping in mind that, for me at least, Kickers <i>are</i> rules (not techniques), the back of the character sheet are part of the rules, and so on...<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to see the character and demon info so I can find out more about what you mean about, "one player character is simply more interesting than the other - mostly due to a more interesting demon and more persons around him."<br/>
<br/>
If you're up for it, I want to dig deeper into, "I also need to get them closer to the center of the relationship map, where all the fun and juicy bits are hiding."<br/>
<br/>
I'm nervous about this because I think there's a little Old School thinking here.... The <i>juciest</i> bits are wherever the Protagonists are -- never in the parts hidden away (though there's a lot of juice in the map, of course.) You might think I'm being flip but I'm not, and you might not grock what I'm talking about here, so if you're interesed in posting more I'd love to see it.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, I'd love find out more about what you mean by this statement: "I feel that I need to get the players more involved in what happens." Because what the Protagonists are doing <i>is</i> what's happening, so I'd like to understand more what's going on.<br/>
<br/>
I'm so glad it went well.<br/>

                            I'll see if I can find the time to post those things over the next few days!<br>
One thing, though: the part about the players being more involved - what I meant to say is that I'd like the players to author more content into the game during play (the diversion between player and protagonist in my above post is really important here!). This session they reacted more than they created so to speak. It's not a huge problem, since we were all feeling our way into the game, but next session, I'd like them to lead a little more than they did tonight. This is not to say that I just pushed them through the story, but that I see the strentgh of their authorship as being very important and something to develop further.<br>
Thanks for caring!<br>

<br/>
Let me put this in your brain and let it roll around for the next few days...<br/>
<br/>
Instead of "leading" them toward more authorship, what if you push them into situations where they have to do something with their characters -- and then step back and give the players a chance to do what they're going to do. There is a difference between these two phrasings, an important one I think.<br/>
<br/>
In this regard, when you get a chance to type up some notes, I'd love to hear about:<br/>
<br/>
1) What Bangs you offered (or the players themselves set up or suggested)<br/>
2) What Humanity rolls were made and what were the narrative circumstances of the rolls<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
