You see, I'm very fond of the game and just about everything about it, but I'm really not a huge fan of the source material. (More accurately, I just haven't been exposed to much of it.)<br/><br/>However, I'm not sure whether it's actually missing that stuff--those MC procedures to develop material for play. Maybe I'm just not seeing certain things because I'm not very familiar with the genre? If that's the case, I want to know what some of your tricks might be--the stuff that makes your Monsterhearts games rock. I want to know which parts I'm missing because I don't understand the <i>game</i>, and which I'm missing because I don't know enough about the <i>genre</i>.<br/><br/><b>The Area I'm Looking At</b><br/><br/>Let me tell you what I'm seeing, and do a quick comparison to Apocalypse World, which I feel like I have a better handle on (even though I'm not super familiar with that genre, either).<br/><br/>* Monsterhearts provides great "higher-level" support for the MC: just like AW, there are Principles and Agenda which tell you where you should be headed as you play the game. Fantastic! These apply to the game as a whole, from start to finish. Things like "blanket in darkness/barf forth apocalyptica": these are over-arching principles of play.<br/>* Also, just like AW, Monsterhearts gives you lots of tools for moment-to-moment play, in the form of MC moves. Great, once again. This tells you what you can say at any given point in play.<br/><br/>However, I can't escape this feeling that the intermediary level is missing: the stuff that's larger than the moment-to-moment minutiae of play, but smaller than the agenda of the game entire. The kind of stuff you might use to generate material for a session or two of play, for example.<br/><br/>How do you go about developing material for what Forge-speak terms "Situation" (significant story developments which push the whole thing along)?<br/><br/>The game positions the PCs relative to each other fairly well ("Backstory" and Strings), but not relative to the world at large (NPCs, institutions, etc.). The only real tool I'm seeing for this is the class seating chart, but putting it to use is not an obvious thing to me. (This is probably my unfamiliarity with the genre speaking.)<br/><br/>So, I suppose I feel lost when it comes to creating adversity, situation, and NPCs for the characters to interact with. Sure, I can bring in my GM tools from other games (e.g. Bangs from Sorcerer, certain character-Flag techniques from games like TSoY, etc.), but first I want to see if there aren't tools already present in Monsterhearts which serve this purpose better. After all, so many people seem to be having a great time with this game, right? <br/><br/>I know that "ask provocative questions" is a huge part of the toolkit, but that's enough without knowing a) what kinds of questions to ask, and b) how to follow up on those questions.<br/><br/><b>Differences from Apocalypse World</b><br/><br/>So, I started thinking about why this doesn't seem as difficult in Apocalypse World. When I initially looked at AW, I saw a similar issue, but the answer to it appeared fairly quickly. Here's how I can see AW answering this question:<br/><br/>1. Apocalypse World gives you Fronts and Threats. These are really strong forces baked into the Situation which the PCs cannot simply avoid. If they ignore the Fronts, threat moves will target them, and sooner or later those countdown clocks will turn their world upside down. Since many of the Front details threaten the PCs' lives, they are essentially unignorable.<br/><br/>Monsterhearts talks a little about a Menace, but suggests that a) it's not necessary to play, b) hints that you shouldn't let it totally take over what the game is about (and my feeling is that the source material also treats this kind of Menace as a backdrop rather than as a prime focus of the story), and c) doesn't give you tools like countdown clocks to make clear how the Menace will affect the characters' lives if it is left unchecked).<br/><br/>(My own gut feeling is that pushing the Menace too hard and too early changes the focus of the game pretty dramatically, and isn't necessarily desirable. I feel like I'd rather find ways to focus more on the inter-personal drama enveloping the PCs.)<br/><br/>2. The post-apocalyptic, violent, anarchy-ridden setting suggests a million logical threats to the PCs' livelihood. There is no obvious status quo: there is, instead, ever-present danger. When at a loss, you can have some raiders attack or some cannibal cult try to eat everyone. In Monsterhearts, in contrast, there is an assumed status quo: the characters have at least somewhat stable lives, families, a regular source of food and a place to sleep, and go to school together. Burning down the town where they live and having them kicked out of school would change the basis of the game dramatically: what do we do next?<br/><br/>3. On a related topic, the ever-present conceit of <b>scarcity</b> suggests multiple avenues for character goals: you must feed and clothe yourself, and fight for your own survival and safety. Simple moves like "make them buy" become very significant: spend your last 1-barter, and you have to start worrying about where you will find something to eat next. <br/><br/>This makes it very easy to ask provocative questions and set up PC-NPC-PC triangles. "Where do you get your ammo?" "Where does the tribe get its drinking water?" "How will you feed three extra mouths in your group?" "Who refuels your bikes? What do they usually ask for in return?" Pick a limited resource and ask a question about it.<br/><br/>Each playbook has some suggested or implied means for using their skills to procure barter/resources and survive. Pointing out any kind of basic scarcity immediately creates a situation which must be dealt with. (You're a killer-for-hire? How are you going to find someone to kill now that you're out of barter?)<br/><br/>4. Finally, many of the playbooks are seeded with start-of-the-session moves (Hardholder, Operator, Hocus, etc.) which are very likely to create unstable situations by themselves. If you have even one of these playbooks at the table, chances are good something tough is happening before you've even started playing. A single bad roll can give enough material for a long stretch of play.<br/><br/>So, all these factors (and maybe others I haven't thought of) provide an easy source of dramatic events, character motivation, and easy topics for provocative questions.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399905/#Comment_399905" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T00:19:58+00:00" title="December  7, 2012 12:19AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Monsterhearts Equivalent?</b><br/><br/>I'm not sure what takes the role of these tools at that intermediate level ("How do we establish unstable Situation in this session?") in Monsterhearts.<br/><br/>The seating chart and the "have a fight, party, or disappearance" are great tools. But what are they tools for? Is drama guaranteed simply by having someone throw a party? What if a teacher disappears but no one cares? As MC, I'd like to have some idea of what I'm trying to push or pull at by creating those situations, so I can better repurpose them for those goals.<br/><br/>What would I do?<br/><br/>I know I would want to ask the characters to tell me about the kind of trouble they're experiencing:<br/><br/>* in their school environment,<br/>* in their family or home environment, and/or<br/>* in their romantic lives.<br/><br/>I would try to find out what kind of significant source of unhappiness is plaguing them. Is their monstrous nature negatively impacting one of those three things? What do they wish they could change about their lives right now? How could they go about that?<br/><br/>Essentially, this would be not unlike establishing in-fiction goals for each character. Basically, I would want to write up a Kicker for each character. <br/><br/>But those things are not really in the rules: it says, "ask provocative questions", yes, but leaves it at that. It's one thing you can do, but not something you *must* do in order to play.<br/><br/>So, am I missing something? What do you do when you MC Monsterhearts? Do you do anything that's not in the book, but you feel is essential to your game working?<br/><br/>I'm trying to find out whether my worries are about a gap in the text or just a gap in my understanding of the genre. If I watched more vampire teen dramas, would my concerns disappear? <br/><br/>(Quick example: For instance, out of curiosity, I watched the first two episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. From that source I can conclude that one way to run Monsterhearts is to establish a very frightening Menace right from the start. However, I don't feel that the story developed in those first two episodes really gets to the good stuff in the game. There isn't a whole lot of PC-PC interaction, I don't see anyone dealing with body horror, and I don't see a whole lot of Strings being used. It seems to me that the Monsterhearts *game* has a lot more depth to it than what I saw in those two episodes. Will I feel the same way about a lot of other source material? I don't want to watch and/or read a ton of stories that I'm not really that keen on.)<br/><br/>My feeling is that the "scarcity" in Monsterhearts is all about:<br/><br/>* Acceptance<br/>* Love/comfort<br/>* Popularity<br/><br/>But targeting those is less obvious when a character, as written, starts out as a blank slate on those points. <br/><br/>I'm looking forward to your thoughts, collective Story Games consciousness.

I wouldn't stress it too much. Just play as the rules say: Create characters together, author your world with collaborative storytelling and establish the starting situation through the hooks in the playbooks. The seating chart introduces named NPCs with connections developed through provocative questioning. Questions that target what the characters think, feel and how might they act on those impulses? The party, fight or disappearance allow you to frame the stakes you are interested in as MC in a well known and familiar 'setting' using all the disparate information garnered through chargen. Re-incorporate that stuff like crazy. If the players authored something, then they are interested in it, so threaten it, take it away, make it part of an untenable situation or hard choice or give it long term consequences.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend writing emotional connections / physical dalliances / wants and needs / status arrows all over the seating chart. It needs to be your Rel-map of the tension and drama established. I like to physically hand out 'strings' too. We use little red stones for harm and lengths of chunky yarn for strings.<br/><br/>Don't forget the moves themselves give you all sorts of little tidbits that feed the intermediate level of play that you feel is absent. Let things stew for a while, build on what's immediate then come back to some of the questions you are curious about.<br/><br/>Aggressively frame scenes. Ask the players (by addressing the characters) what they want and where they want to be. Let them in on scene framing and antagonise the heart out of their intent. Once moves start snowballing, make the hardest MC move you dare, and generally narrative effects are far more juicy than mechanical ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399916/#Comment_399916" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T02:40:59+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  2:40AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Noofy!

Where Apocalypse World uses Fronts, Monsterhearts doesn't. Instead (a bit like Fiasco), it relies on a fizzing relationship map, which draws in both PCs and NPCs. That's where you get your Situation from.<br/><br/>I think the tool you're missing is "Make monsters seem human; make humans seem monstrous". (There are probably others, but that's the one that comes to mind). Remember the example, in which the seedy, faintly-monstrous parent of one character is coming on to the underage student, who is another character? (I haven't got the book to hand, but it's the one where she bends over to get a beer from the refrigerator).<br/><br/>That's the sort of situation you want. It comes straight from the relationship map. You do it by making the parent predatory, in a faintly-but-not-completely monstrous way.<br/><br/>In a similar way, look at the PC's relationships and think how to make them darker and more monstrous.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399929/#Comment_399929" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T06:06:28+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  6:06AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2012 6:08AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>You're right that Monsterhearts works differently from Apocalypse World.

It's a game about intercharacter drama (more in the "internet drama" sense than classical drama, but the very real risk of it turning murderous at any minute tends to elevate the stakes), as opposed to AW, which is a game which has intercharacter drama in it as one element among several.<br/><br/>I don't really think MH is missing any GM advice, but maybe the stuff it has doesn't seem as important as it may until you actually use it?  My group more or less ran MH off the cuff after reading it once, just following the procedures and principles religiously, and it was immensely satisfying and successful.  The book really does seem like a how-to guide to get the kind of play I was expecting from the World of Darkness but never quite achieved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399934/#Comment_399934" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T06:54:15+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  6:54AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to jump in with the stolen cars thing.

In a session I didn't GM, the Menace was more prominent, but used more as a wedge to drive between players and give them conflicting interests (Smallville style, and I admit having read and played that game might have also helped us grok what MH was saying) than a driver of "plot" per se in its own right.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399945/#Comment_399945" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T08:17:36+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  8:17AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah I love the stolen car.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399976/#Comment_399976" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T11:32:13+00:00" title="December  7, 2012 11:32AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2012 11:38AM by Paul_T.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed, good advice all around.

At the beginning of the game, however, we don't have these things in place (except for maybe the first one).<br/><br/>What is the way to get those elements into place? How do we get two characters pissed off with each other but forced to live together for a while, and in a dysfunctional family situation?<br/><br/>I have my own tools, sure, from other games (and I suggested a few things along those lines in my first two posts). What I'm not sure about is how the text is telling me to establish those elements. Is there a better tool already available?<br/><br/>"Ask provocative questions" is there, yes. Is that the tool? I'm cool with using it, sure. But is this the procedure the game presents? \n<blockquote>"Using provocative questions of your choice, create some relationships and stuff and then use your MC instincts to frame some interesting scenes. It's not too hard to do that in this game, you'll figure it out!"</blockquote>\nIf that's the case, I'm fine with it. I just want to double-check.<br/><br/>To me, it feels like I need to import some other GM/MC tools to create Situation for this game. Graham is absolutely right that a fizzing relationship map is the key tool here. However, I'm pretty sure the book doesn't ever actually tell us to create one. (Everything about the genre and MC principles suggests that one should exist, but stops short of actually showing you how to do it.) <br/><br/>The homeroom seating chart helps create a relationship map, as does, for example, the Queen's gang, but I don't see either of those things leading me clearly to the situation in the Long Example.<br/><br/>Maybe a better way to frame this might be:<br/><br/>How close would a group *completely unfamiliar with the genre* get to a "proper" game of Monsterhearts by just following the procedures in the text?<br/><br/>For example, Apocalypse World's Hardholder rules and Chopper gang rules paint a really clear picture of what life in the post-Apocalypse is like, and how authority operates, what kinds of problems communities face, etc. You open on the game knowing that, let'say, the hardhold is suffering because they have no food (hunger), and someone's been killing the Chopper's gang members because they brag too much (reprisals). Does Monsterhearts help us create the dysfunctional family situation and the kid who's not invited to the prom because she's gay? Or are we just expected to draw on our collective understanding of the genre? (Which is not a bad solution to a game about an experience many of its readers are personally familiar with, of course.)<br/><br/>I really hope I'm being clear here. This is not a complaint or a plea for help. I'm just looking to broaden my range of available tools and have a fun discussion about Monsterhearts.

The examples of how provocative questions should be, from page 124, include things like "During the summer, what did Desmond get arrested for?" and "Are the rumours about Miguel true? What are they?" and \u201cWhat did Aseem do to piss you off, last practice?\u201d, which suggested to me that the group should be pretty invested in making sure the game starts out with either an unstable situation, or one which is very likely to become so in very short order.  The stolen cars thing is specifically GM advice, but playing PCs that way can also reap dividends.<br/><br/>Also bear in mind that that PCs are part of the seating chart; when my group played, we made sure to ask those kinds of questions that reflected on the PCs, in addition to the backstory on every Skin.  I distinctly recall asking one player when his character stopped getting high with the NPC next to him, and why.\n<blockquote>To me, it feels like I need to import some other GM/MC tools to create Situation for this game.

My group DOES have familiarity with the genre, so I suppose we are not an unbiased enough control group, but we honestly did run MH the same way we did AW, and both times the games worked the way the books said they would (and to be honest, I think the MH book is a lot clearer about certain things than AW is).  <br/><br/><br/>The advice in the book seemed sufficient and directly applicable, to me.  I don't see MH as being tremendously different in its aims or general flow of play than Fiasco, and Fiasco has WAY less advice on how to let your characters' base desires and general hard-headedness lead them astray.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399991/#Comment_399991" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T12:24:57+00:00" title="December  7, 2012 12:24PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did the "by the book" thing too when I ran Monsterhearts the first time or at least tried to.

That's the relationship map.

They are both a mechanical widget and points of chaos in the narrative, since earning them usually if not always requires some kind of dramatic (and usually inappropriate) behavior.  PCs are incentivized to get them, which incentivizes them to act out, and NPCs can get them on PCs (sometimes as side effects of Skin moves) which gives you carte blanche to introduce further destabilization with an unprompted hard move.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400000/#Comment_400000" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T12:46:50+00:00" title="December  7, 2012 12:46PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We used the Seating Chart to keep track of the Strings held by NPCs and short descriptions of a few words too.

The MC just frames them into a scene together. So it's not really like a Bang in Sorcerer terms. Hopefully you can see why I consider that an important detail!<br/><br/>As for backstories/Strings making a relationship map, you're right that I might be underestimating how much of a Situation they create. I can see lots of combinations of backstories that don't create an <i>untenable</i> Situation, but that could be my imagination at play!<br/> <br/>Let's see what Joe has to say!

However, there is at least one possible reading of this Actual Play which (to me) does not sound like what I would want to get out of a game of Monsterhearts.<br/><br/>We have the characters living together in a house, and some minor tension but no real "Kicker" for the action to start. The players take some time to generate some detail for the fiction and some characterization (e.g. descriptions of the food in the fridge), but there's no real conflict, no real story direction. It sounds like the players don't know what to *do* in the game. The MC feels the urge to ask for a "perception check" in order to jump-start some action. A person shows up at the door, but there's no real reason the PCs can't just ignore this person.<br/><br/>Eventually, the MC introduces some action and a sort of plot hook, and the game gets rolling. Based on the writeup (again, I'm sure other things happened in play that aren't being mentioned--but let's just look at the written report for a moment), it sounds like the PCs set off to investigate a mystery as a group, not unlike a game of D&amp;D or Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>This is not too dissimilar to the two episodes of Buffy that I saw (which played out more like a light-hearted action adventure). If that's what the group was going for, then they probably had a great time. However, I don't see the promise of the Monsterhearts text fulfilled in this writeup: no messy love triangles and tough moral choices where teenagers feel alienated from their bodies. <br/><br/>Let's assume for a minute that my reading of this Actual Play is correct (and I don't necessarily think that it is, but it's a good example for this thread, I feel). Is the group violating or ignoring some of the basic procedures of play? If so, which ones?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400034/#Comment_400034" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T15:34:30+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  3:34PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it is?

First, I want to address something I'm seeing here.<br/><br/>It sounds like you're worried about having to create some form of 'content' that the game isn't asking you to create. You talk about Fronts, Situation, plot, the need to "develop material." I think the biggest piece of advice I can offer is: aim to take a backseat. I think you're hunting a ghost here. You don't have to do that much. You need to get the ball rolling (pages 136 and 137 give you information on how to do that), and then lean back and watch these PCs get at each others' throats and belt buckles. You'll use your Principles and Hard Moves to agitate and stir the plot, but by no means should that require you to "engineer a plot." All you should be doing is using your toolkit to steer the characters crashing back into one another.\n<blockquote>The only real tool I'm seeing for this is the class seating chart, but putting it to use is not an obvious thing to me. (This is probably my unfamiliarity with the genre speaking.)</blockquote>\nIt sounds like familiarity with the genre would go a long way. I'd start with the movie <i>Jennifer's Body</i>, and the pilot for <i>The Vampire Diaries</i>. If you have more time, I'd then move on to watch an episode of <i>True Blood</i> and one of <i>Being Human</i>. If you have still more time, I'd watch the first (and only the first) <i>Twilight</i> movie.<br/><br/>As far as the seating chart goes - it gives you a bunch of named characters to ask questions about. It gives you a reason to ask 10-20 provocative questions up-front. It gives you an initial scene to frame (look at the seating chart. what tensions can you imagine emerging between two people sitting next to each other? frame that happening during the middle of class).\n<blockquote>1. Apocalypse World gives you Fronts and Threats. These are really strong forces baked into the Situation which the PCs cannot simply avoid. If they ignore the Fronts, threat moves will target them, and sooner or later those countdown clocks will turn their world upside down. Since many of the Front details threaten the PCs' lives, they are essentially unignorable.<br/><br/>Monsterhearts talks a little about a Menace, but suggests that a) it's not necessary to play, b) hints that you shouldn't let it totally take over what the game is about (and my feeling is that the source material also treats this kind of Menace as a backdrop rather than as a prime focus of the story), and c) doesn't give you tools like countdown clocks to make clear how the Menace will affect the characters' lives if it is left unchecked).</blockquote>\nSo, Apocalypse World gives you a whole bunch of tools for representing the push and pull of the outside world, of rival factions, of scarcity and want, of mighty legions and something beyond the small bubble that the characters live in. You spend time focusing on the internal landscapes of the PCs, and time focusing on their relationships, and then suddenly you're sucked back into the wider picture.<br/><br/>Outside worlds, rival factions, scarcities, legions... none of that stuff matters in Monsterhearts. At least, none of it matters <i>by default</i>. What matters is the PCs: their insecurities, their horny daydreams, the fact that one of them failed the last math test and needs to tell his parents, the fact that one of them is pregnant and doesn't know what to do about it. Ask your players provocative questions, and trust that they'll respond with provocative answers. Use your NPCs to poke at those provocative answers, especially by creating PC-NPC-PC triangles. Follow your Principles.\n<blockquote>When at a loss [in Apocalypse World], you can have some raiders attack or some cannibal cult try to eat everyone. In Monsterhearts, in contrast, there is an assumed status quo: the characters have at least somewhat stable lives, families, a regular source of food and a place to sleep, and go to school together. Burning down the town where they live and having them kicked out of school would change the basis of the game dramatically: what do we do next?</blockquote>\nTeenagers don't have status quos. See, Brad's ex-girlfriend Jessie had brown hair, and when Brad broke up with her he said she "wasn't her type." Now he's dating you - a blonde witch named Lilith. Except Jessie just showed up to school with dyed-blonde hair and sporting sexy red lipstick. Brad totally checked her out twice. What do you do about it, Lilith?<br/><br/>We just took the only stable relationship among the PCs (yours), and shook it up a bit. Following the Principles, it's likely to lead to drama regardless of your response. If you play it off like it's not a thing, then I'll totally make humans seem monstrous: Brad will cheat on you. If you demonstrate your suspicions, maybe I look to <b>happiness always comes at someone else's expense</b> and explore what happens when Brad crushes her hard. Or maybe I look to <b>accept people, but only conditionally</b> and have Brad assure you that he'll never cheat on her, but you need to be comfortable with him hanging out with Jessie as much  as he wants. And then clearly he begins tenuously pushing up against the wall of that agreement if you agree. If you take Jessie aside and put her in her place, then the results of the <i>shut someone down</i> roll let us know whether her response is simmering rage that erupts a session later, crushed heartbreak + sobs, or locker-room gang violence. All it takes is changing Jessie's hair color and suddenly everything we thought was stable is tilted sideways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400071/#Comment_400071" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-08T02:30:45+00:00" title="December  8, 2012  2:30AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This isn't entirely in-topic, but my post-game dissection of when I've run MH for short-term games (either con games or one/two-session games) I realised I'd made too many NPCs in populating the seating chart. I reckon that starting with, say, the same number of classmates as PCs as an absolute maximum would have been enough initially (you, or the players, can always add extra) and would have led the players into bouncing off each other much sooner. <br/><br/>I did experience a little of the wondering what the next action point would be, but I think that was why...

I'd rather know that one character has an alcoholic, abusive father, and another has a cousin who's in the hospital, and a third's pissed off because she's been kicked off the cheerleading squad, so she wants to get her revenge on the cheerleading coach. The seating chart looks like it gives us a lot of NPCs, but not necessarily the ones the characters care about most.<br/><br/>Joe,<br/><br/>Fantastic answer and fantastic examples. I think familiarity with the genre is a big thing here, and I'll try to do some more "research" in the near future! <br/><br/>I still think that, at least for someone like me who's not super familiar with the genre, the game doesn't offer as much support for the creation of Situation as Apocalypse World. Consider, for example, the difference between the Queen and the Chopper. The Chopper's gang (with its drawback tags, like "unreliable bikes" and "vulnerable to reprisals"), and the way the <i>pack alpha</i> and <i>fucking thieves</i> moves work, gives you material to build on from the very start. If I don't know what kind of move to make as MC--or what kind of provocative question t oask, I can point to one of those things. I can say, "Hey, Hardholder, what was the very worst thing the Chopper's gang ever stole from you?" Or maybe I can say, "Hardholder, there's this dude Balls at your door. He used to be in the Chopper's gang, but now he says he's done with that and he wants to work for you, instead. What do you do?"<br/><br/>The Queen's gang moves are all about using the gang as a tool. We don't get to say what's wrong with the gang, or how they cause trouble. Only "And Your Enemies Closer" hints that the gang could be a source of drama for anyone<br/><br/>So, naturally, when I'm not sure what kind of stuff I can introduce to the game, I want to look to where I can draw inspiration for developing Situation. Just to be clear: I think this applies just as much as a player as an MC. I know this is not the kind of game where someone comes to the table with a "plot" or anything like that, don't worry. But, as a player, I'm looking for different ways to get a grasp on what kind of input will really work in this game, what kinds of situations are genre-appropriate.<br/><br/>The bit I find strange is that so much of the MC advice in the book focuses on the Menace (a whole chapter), which seems at best tangential to the main action of the game. <br/><br/>When *I* look through the chapter on "The First Session", the bit that jumps out at me as the most important is:\n<blockquote>"Learn what they want and what they\u2019re afraid of."</blockquote>\nThat's where I would want to focus, and the text just mentions it twice in there, without going into any depth. I think I would want to make sure I found out what each character's home life was like, how they don't fit in at school, how their monstrous nature is hurting their academic status at school, what relationships or accomplishments they treasure most, stuff like that. Maybe I'll make a pick-and-choose options list for family life, school life, and romantic life troubles...<br/><br/>Also, the "Under the Skins" chapter has good material for situation-development, which I might be overlooking a bit.<br/><br/>I think that the reason the game doesn't have or need this much support is simply because the genre is so familiar to most of its players. That's fine, and a very smart way to design a game. <br/><br/>I'd love to hear your thoughts on the Actual Play I linked there, too. Can you see why I posted it?<br/><br/>And take your time! This is a fun discussion, not an urgent one. I'm really excited about Monsterhearts, so I'm enjoying poking at it and turning it over to see how it works. I'm certainly not sitting at home tearing my hair out or anything like that!<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400164/#Comment_400164" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T01:11:47+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  1:11AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2012 1:12AM by Mcdaldno.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The Queen's gang moves are all about using the gang as a tool.

When someone takes a gang, you are basically handed some pre-baked provocative questions you can either stew over or ask the player. Specifically, each gang has a demand it makes on its members (and The Queen is most certainly a member of zir own gang), as well as something which triggers it into <i>blind</i> action.<br/><br/>I've not seen a Queen's gang go a whole session without some mixture of: erroneous murder, messy drug trips, kidnappings, hallway violence, intimidating the principal, creepy cult-initiation orgies, or turning on their master.\n<blockquote>I still think that, at least for someone like me who's not super familiar with the genre, the game doesn't offer as much support for the creation of Situation as Apocalypse World.

What do you do?"</blockquote>\nAs far as wondering what provocative questions to ask and build off, I feel like the book does a good job of offering those. For Seating Charts (page 136) there are six example questions. The next page (page 137) gives you solid starting scenes with suggestions for things you can introduce into them. Your Principles tell you what to look for and engage with during those scenes. During play, the Ask Provocative Questions principle (page 107) lists five different kinds of questions you can ask, and provides an example of each. Also, just ask questions about how and why high school sucks. That's something that most of us have access to.<br/><br/>If you do nothing more than ask provocative questions, ask "what do you do?", and call for basic moves where you see them... you'll be a fine Monsterhearts MC and the game will excel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400175/#Comment_400175" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T04:30:11+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  4:30AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2012 5:00AM by Paul_T.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, <br/><br/>Awesome. And thank you for pointing out the gang rules: I'd forgotten about that (very important) detail! That said, it also suffers a little bit from a need to be very familiar with the genre. I have to scratch my head a bit to think of ideas: I can find it easy to imagine what kinds of demands a gang forces on its members (e.g. the movie Heathers) but I'm not sure what kinds of things trigger a gang into blind action (other than people doing bad things to its members, maybe). Hmmmm. I'll think on this one!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I've been mulling over this thread, and what kind of supportive mechanics *I* would find helpful. Here's one to try on for size. I suppose it's a kind of custom character creation move. Let me know if it seems like it would fit in Monsterhearts, or whether it misses the genre (by putting too much focus in the wrong place).<br/>\n<blockquote><b>High School is Complicated, Dude</b><br/><br/>Once you've chosen your Skin, stats, moves, and so on, take a look at this list of problems:<br/><br/>* My academics are really suffering: I'm in danger of flunking some important classes, or worse.<br/>* My family, my home, or my life outside school is a dysfunctional mess, unstable, hurtful, jarring.<br/>* I'm unpopular, shunned, forced out of the circle or group I desperately wish I could be a part of.<br/>* My romantic life is a disaster, or non-existent. Something just happened which has left me lonely and heartbroken.<br/>* I'm in some serious trouble with the authorities: either the school administration, the local police, or both.<br/><br/>First, choose two of these and cross them out. These are definitely <i>not</i> problems for you right now. Very much the opposite, in fact.<br/><br/>Second, choose one more and write this beside it:<br/><br/>"Yeah, maybe that's <i>kind of</i> true. But it doesn't bother me too much; I don't really care right now."<br/><br/>This is something that could be a problem for you later, but not just yet.<br/><br/>You can make it a less serious problem, too, if you want.<br/><br/>The remaining two, though, those are trouble. They occupy your mind, they're constantly staring you in the face. Tell us how and why.<br/><br/>At least one other player character is involved in each of your problems. For each problem, choose another character and then pick one:<br/><br/>* They're helping you fix the problem <br/>* You look up to them as your model for how you <i>wish</i> your life would go<br/>* They're the source of the problem <br/><br/>Of course, use your backstories and Strings to inform which of these three you choose.<br/></blockquote>\n<br/>Example 1:<br/><br/>Luke is a Queen, and the captain of his school's swim team.<br/><br/><i>Luke's player choose two things that aren't problems at all (popularity and romantic life):</i><br/><br/>He's very popular, and he's dating the hottest girl in school.<br/><br/><i>Next, Luke's player leaves one issue as a potential future problem, but not a big deal now:</i><br/><br/>Things aren't as good at home: his parents are getting divorced, and that means they might lose their house. But whatever, he doesn't really care about that right now.<br/><br/><i>Finally, the two remaining issues, and related characters:</i><br/><br/>His gang (the swim team) has been buying these weird drugs from this weird new kid Lilith (the Fae) and dealing them at school. The police found some of the drugs at the last swim meet, and Luke's barely keeping his head above water trying to keep himself as well as his friends out of more serious trouble. <br/><br/>Worse yet, between spending time with his new girlfriend, his dedication to his swim team, and trying to keep his gang (and himself) from getting arrested, he failed History last term, and is now in danger of flunking out of school altogether. Now he's trying to get on Willow's good side, whatever it takes, so she'll help him pass his exams.<br/><br/><br/>Example 2:<br/><br/>Willow is a young Witch, very smart but a little nerdy.<br/><br/>She's a straight-A student, and she's never been in trouble for anything, so that's good.<br/><br/>She's not very popular at school, though, and the "cool kids" mock her sometimes, but she's above that - or thinks she is - for now.<br/><br/>Luke was her best friend since they were five years old. But now he's dating this cheerleader, and Willow is beginning to realize that maybe, just maybe, they aren't going to get married when they finish high school like she always imagined they would. She's got a journal full of angry letters to him, but she's never said anything about it to him in real life, not yet. <br/><br/>Her friend Buffy, though, is helping her find a date for the prom: she seems to know how to deal with boys, and thinks making Luke jealous might be her best bet.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, though, things are really not going well at home. Her mom's got this new boyfriend, and the other day she came home crying and sporting a black eye. Willow wishes she could be like Lilith, who seems so carefree, like this stuff would just never happen to her. What's she doing that Willow isn't?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Basically, I'm looking at Monsterhearts a little bit like Dogs in the Vineyard: "Here are some tools you can use to change things (the gun and the Book of Life vs. your monstrous self and your weird-ass moves, your gang, etc)." The idea behind this custom move is that helps me ground the characters in real-life problems that their tools are *really* not suited to fixing: the equivalent to Town Creation. <br/><br/>It's just that, in Monsterhearts (unlike Apocalypse World and Dogs), those problems aren't about troubled communities or the world at large: they're all about self-centered, personal problems inherent to the characters' private lives and they way the view themselves.<br/><br/>[edited a bunch]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400176/#Comment_400176" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T04:38:41+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  4:38AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2012 4:45AM by Paul_T.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I've not seen a Queen's gang go a whole session without some mixture of: erroneous murder, messy drug trips, kidnappings, hallway violence, intimidating the principal, creepy cult-initiation orgies, or turning on their master.<br/></blockquote>\nI'm also saving this sentence and adding it to my copy of Monsterhearts!

If you're all great, proactive players with great familiarity with the genre, sure, you'll come up with this stuff on your own. But if I'm feeling like I'm not sure what this game and I just want to try it, or maybe I'm just not feeling "on" that night, I don't easily get from "make a seating chart" to "my single dad is in trouble with the law, and my friend is staying with us because she has nowhere to live".<br/><br/>Again, this is why I posted that Actual Play link. It's not mine, sure, but it looks like what I imagine a potential breakdown would look like.<br/><br/>Can you tell me more about what a "player-facing" situation move looks like? Is that just shorthand for "let the players come with the situation, ask them questions until you've got enough details to work with?" (Not that this is at all a bad method, mind you.)<br/><br/>Jason, can you give an example for illustration?<br/><br/>I know I'm exaggerating the situation a bit: the Skins and moves and genre and everything is already very evocative. But hey, at the very least thinking about it got me to make this move. So that's cool: it means this is a more productive thread (at least for me) than 90% of S-G threads. Thanks!<br/><br/>I like how, in AW, you can start playing (as a player, anyway) with no knowledge of the genre or the setting, and by the time the session starts, you pretty much know what kind of trouble you're in for, and what some of your goals might be. The hardhold is in want and your gang is rebelling and you've got no food.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400222/#Comment_400222" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T14:36:37+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  2:36PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>High School is Complicated, Dude</b><br/><br/>Once you've chosen your Skin, stats, moves, and so on, take a look at this list of problems:<br/><br/>* My academics are really suffering: I'm in danger of flunking some important classes, or worse.<br/>* My family, my home, or my life outside school is a dysfunctional mess, unstable, hurtful, jarring.<br/>* I'm unpopular, shunned, forced out of the circle or group I desperately wish I could be a part of.<br/>* My romantic life is a disaster, or non-existent.

A couple comments:<br/><br/>I think "5 problems, pick 2" is good enough. Whether or not something is maybe sorta true can fall under the purview of asking provocative questions, right? You already start with 2 scenes per character that basically frame themselves, and then a backup of three questions the MC can ask (like: "so why isn't this other thing on the list a problem for you.. when it IS a problem for your best friend?"). Just circle or check off 2 I think gets you right to the goods with the least amount of work.<br/><br/>And I feel like the list for connecting other PCs to your problems kinda steps on the toes of strings. Like, connecting other PCs is good, but you can just look at your string as-is. If you didn't have those skin-specific starting strings details I can see why you'd need that connection list, but as-is I think it's extraneous.<br/><br/>I've been considering using BW-style beliefs with AW rules, for xp, with players writing their beliefs from scratch, but this makes me think you could start with a list of beliefs (ie the problems you list) for each playbook, to give you a starting sitch right out of the gate. And then you can change them and write your own after you start playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400223/#Comment_400223" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T14:42:34+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  2:42PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because of strings, that's why. <br/><br/>Here, let me look at the example you gave earlier:\n<blockquote><br/>Example 2:<br/><br/>Willow is a young Witch, very smart but a little nerdy.<br/><br/>She's a straight-A student, and she's never been in trouble for anything, so that's good.<br/><br/>She's not very popular at school, though, and the "cool kids" mock her sometimes, but she's above that - or thinks she is - for now.<br/><br/>Luke was her best friend since they were five years old. But now he's dating this cheerleader, and Willow is beginning to realize that maybe, just maybe, they aren't going to get married when they finish high school like she always imagined they would. She's got a journal full of angry letters to him, but she's never said anything about it to him in real life, not yet. <br/><br/>Her friend Buffy, though, is helping her find a date for the prom: she seems to know how to deal with boys, and thinks making Luke jealous might be her best bet.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, though, things are really not going well at home. Her mom's got this new boyfriend, and the other day she came home crying and sporting a black eye. Willow wishes she could be like Lilith, who seems so carefree, like this stuff would just never happen to her. What's she doing that Willow isn't?</blockquote>\n"You get home and discover your angry letter collection is missing. Someone anonymously has posted the first, most innocuous one, to the school Facebook page. There's a text on your phone from Luke saying "WTF" and one from the cheerleader promising to fuck you up."<br/><br/>"Luke got in trouble for no reason and he's got detention. So does that bitch he's dating and she bragged to her friends that she arranged the whole thing so they could make out in the library when they're supposed to be reshelving books. They're gonna go all the way, this afternoon."<br/><br/>"You found a butterfly hair clip that belongs to your mother in her boyfriend's coat pocket. For some reason he is collecting...sympathetic tokens? There's also an engagement ring in there."<br/><br/>Like, the setup you have is pretty good except there's nothing "about to happen."  If Luke is going to go all the way, or is about to find out about how much you hate him, or whatever, that li'l witch is going to be busting out with Turning Luke On (strings) or stealing the cheerleader's lipstick out of her locker (strings) or something (strings strings strings). The GM introduces some urgent thing and the player responds to it with moves.<br/><br/>You seem really stuck on that particular elaborate setup in the big example. Don't worry about it, you will get an elaborate and tangled setup of your own as soon as players start making moves and not being able to roll a 11.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400232/#Comment_400232" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T16:09:20+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  4:09PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>this makes me think you could start with a list of beliefs (ie the problems you list) for each playbook, to give you a starting sitch right out of the gate.

However, it is a piece of advice about MCing from one of my friends blogs that I think is useful. And since you've asked about tools to MC with I feel it is related enough to post. <br/><br/>Things I'm still learning:<br/><br/>Punch hard. Punch so hard they should see stars. I had said earlier you had to watch how hard you punch. It's all lies... if they take the time to freak out and cry about that, it's fine. The players are going to take those moments to go into a corner and cry a good, long hard time. However, the beauty of Monsterhearts is that you then as the MC say, "What do you do?" And a good player will eventually realize that while sitting in a corner and crying is a thing to do, eventually you come out of that corner swinging. And oh, how amazingly delicious it is.<br/><br/>Tell them everything. The power of the "gotcha!" is a fun toy in the gaming toolbox, but it ends up getting used terribly, and it just pisses people off. I've definitely had to lean back and hand over information, stuff I would have been completely happy keeping hidden until later. I've found that the info I've given has made their lives generally more complicated and an overall better story. They know all sorts of things about the demon Rife, but haven't met him yet. Some of them... even seem to have some sympathy for his problems. Awesome.<br/><br/>When you're done for the day, stop. I've now run a few times where I've kept going past where my brain was able to deal out enough stuff. In the writeup for the game, it says you'll do a session for about 4 hours. We've generally gone way longer, just because damn, they like to talk to one another. I've found my trigger from when I've gone too far is when I have an NPC show up and ask about something, for no reason. "Why are they doing that?" ... "I don't know," I reply to myself. I've found that if you don't find a nice stopping point, the best thing to do is just stop, nearly cold, maybe do a sum-up. It may feel like it's in the middle of things, it may feel awkward not having a nice episode end, and it's totally fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400256/#Comment_400256" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T19:52:54+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  7:52PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2012 7:56PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">@Johnstone</a> - I don't disagree with that! I put the "not a problem right now" option there for two reasons: one is to give you something to build on later, and another is for a way for the player to say "I don't want to deal with this, I'm not interested in it". If they create a problem but say they're not worried, they want it to surface later. If they minimize the problem, they probably just don't want to see it in play at all. For example, they want to play a character whose family situation never comes up. Cool!<br/><br/>Highlighting two things as "strengths" also gives everyone some things to threaten in your character's life. "You have great grades? OK, let's see if you can maintain them when..."<br/><br/>As for the connections, you're right that the backstories and starting Strings will often take care of these. In that case, you have no extra work to do: it's already done for you. But it seems to me that sometimes they won't, then this reminder is in place. "Hey, have you thought about how another character might be involved in this?"<br/><br/>(For example, the Fae's starting Strings are: "You wear your heart on your sleeve. Give everyone one String. You\u2019ve captured someone\u2019s fancy. Gain 2 Strings on them." It's possible that this doesn't give you the messy starting Situation. Again, please look at the linked Actual Play and let me know whether you see what I'm talking about or not.)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a> - Yeah, the Strings play into this, obviously. I understand that 95% of the battle I'm imagine is fought for me by the game system. Starting Strings, moves snowball, all that. I'm just trying to fill that 5% gap, for myself, or other players who might not be familiar with the genre. <br/><br/>Like you might look at Dogs in the Vineyard and say: "Hey, here's a description of fantasy Mormon life and beliefs in this chapter. And the conflict rules will make sure messy stuff happens. Why do you need a Town Creation procedure? All the tools are right there!" <br/><br/>Well, for that one guy or three who don't get it and instead just make a town with a single criminal in it. The Dogs investigate and kill him, end of story. They don't understand why they didn't find any moral ambiguity, like the book promised. <br/><br/>It's for the one girl who just would never think of Pride as an important thing, even though it's hinted at in the book in a million places. She's suddenly feeling really stuck.<br/><br/>It's to communicate the genre and the expectations of play better to the reader and the players, in case someone out there wants to try the game and experience it, but just *doesn't get it* for lack of familiarity.<br/><br/>Does that sound like nonsense?<br/><br/>I'm being serious, though. For example: I read the whole Monsterhearts book and watched a few episodes of Buffy. But until I read the Long Example, it didn't occur to me for a second that it might be interesting to bring in a *family* situation. It's never mentioned in the book, or any of the playbooks, and it doesn't happen at all in Buffy (or a lot of other source material). <br/><br/>So, if I'm sitting down to play Monsterhearts and I'm trying to come up with a character concept, but I'm feeling stuck... and someone hands me the "High School is Complicated" move I wrote above, it's a huge revelation to see "family trouble" on there! Oh, man! What a great idea! That could lead to some really messy, intense situations!<br/><br/>Hell, maybe I'm not even that clueless. I just forgot about that possibility because I'm tired tonight or whatever. It's a helpful tool!<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's necessary for everyone. Maybe I'm the only one in the world who feels this way! It could be.<br/><br/>But it's not terribly helpful when people go: "Trust the Force, man! You'll get it somehow. No, I don't want to give you any examples or any ideas. It's better if you come up with your own."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400260/#Comment_400260" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T20:34:03+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  8:34PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Full disclosure, haven't played MH as yet.

But you probably have to bribe them. With what? You'll hex their enemy.<br/>Shut Someone Down - Confront Luke and get cold as shit with him. Or maybe the girlfriend.<br/><br/>Probably you will pursue all of these things, or maybe turn to magic.  Let's trace out just one of the options so you can see how tangled it gets when you start not hitting 11s:<br/><br/>Let's say you go after Luke because it's now or never. Turn him on. you don't roll an 11, because your Hot is -1. Now Luke promises you something they think you want. Luke thinks you want him to go trash the guy who is leaking the letters. Crap. The next day he disappears and the Bill, the dude who is crushing on you, shows up in a cast. Says he fell down the stairs. Meanwhile Luke's girlfriend blames you. She's going to fuck you up after school. You Run Away, but you don't roll an 11, so you end up someplace worse, or the girlfriend gets a string on you, that can't be good. You confront people but your ability to Manipulate them isn't that great (Hot -1, remember?) You're promising the computer nerds this and promising the school Queen bee that just to get them to help even a little.  (<i>"See the Pin pipes it from the lowest scraper for Brad Bramish to sell, maybe. Ask any dope rat where their junk sprang and they'll say they scraped it from that, who scored it from this, who bought it off so, and after four or five connections the list always ends with The Pin. But I bet you, if you got every rat in town together and said "Show your hands" if any of them've actually seen The Pin, you'd get a crowd of full pockets.</i>)<br/><br/>Everyone has strings on you and everyone sees you out on a limb.  You have to turn to magic. Magic works. You hex Bill. Come clean and I'll let you go. Bill loves you so much he's done something REALLY crazy. Maybe Luke is somewhere trapped, or hurt, or something.  So long as you keep Bill in the palm of your hand Luke has a chance. You can keep hexing him or you can be nice, maybe you try to be nice. But Bill wants more and more from you - bribing him with attention is getting really expensive. Hitting him with hexes works so much better. But now you're getting side effects. You're hurting yourself, harm 1, harm 1, harm 1. Your mom thinks you're cutting. Technically you are but it's just because you need your blood. So your mom asks the girl she thinks is your best friend, Luke's girlfriend. She sees her chance and uses your mom to get close to you. Strings start flying. She wrangles an invitation to your house for dinner, then stages a fake suicide attempt by poisoning your milk and slipping a fake suicide note (made with tracings of your angry letter journal so it REALLY IS YOUR HAND WRITING) into your room in the confusion. Now you're in the mental hospital and a simple hex isn't enough to get you out.  You need more. Darkest Self time. Who did you hurt the most? Who did YOU hurt the most? <br/><br/>This is just one thread of moves from one possible reaction to the situation I described (actually not the best of the situations because there isn't a clear immediate antagonist.)

You make characters but then when you start the other players all look at you are you're like "oh right I still have to come up with a scene" and you flail around.

And you the MC have something concrete to start with, regardless of how well you prepped.<br/><br/>I'm just critiquing the efficiency is all--you want that minimum of chargen to maximum used material ration (or I do, anyway). So when you connect those two choices to other PCs and <i>then</i> do strings, you're like "didn't I do this step already?" It just needs a little design work to smooth it out.

This thread has been pretty insightful, and it's obvious that I did drift the game a bit toward territory that the players were more familiar with. <br/><br/>The initial stages of the session were a bit stagnant because I kept on the players, asking them "what do you do now?"...and the players just described mundane details of their lives. I had set up a witness protection program for the characters with a number of subtle tensions that could have built up in a slow burn, gradually moving to a point where explosions might occur. But this was simply starting to frustrate the players (who were after a bit of intrigue or excitement like they'd find in a traditional game). <br/><br/>So I provided this...drifting the play to a Cthulhu style investigation, gradually hoping to introduce the love-triangles and social play of Monsterhearts toward the end of the session and then escalate this side of things while downplaying the ongoing investigation.<br/><br/>Failed moves on the part of the characters allowed me to push the complications of the investigation storyline, but I deliberately made the investigation slow. Forcing the players to come up with activities while the background gradually unfolded.<br/><br/>This worked to some degree (something I glossed over in the AP report), as the two female characters watched a next door neighbur mow the lawn and decided that he was "hot". They both decided to make attempts to turn him on...and failed. When the male PC decided to introduce himself, I figured it would be funny if there was a chance for a lazy-slob football watching vampire to turn on the hot neighbour...the player went with it, just to see what would happen, and he successfully turned on the NPC. This has led to two instant love triangles...<br/><br/>PC boyfriend and PC girlfriend, where the NPC is after the boyfriend, and the girlfriend is confused about the new arrival.<br/><br/>PC female and PC male both linked to an NPC male, where PC female wants the NPC but doesn't have a link to him, and PC male isn;t sure what he wants but has links to the NPC male anyway.<br/><br/>I think this is where the "real" Monsterhearts game will begin and the investigative drama will fall away, only to rise to prominence when (or if) other aspects of the story stagnate.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400290/#Comment_400290" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T02:34:35+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  2:34AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on!<br/><br/>Just to be super-clear: I'm not at all criticizing your game.

I started with the "Willow" character from Buffy (based on my very very limited exposure to the show). The Witch backstory and Strings give her two sympathetic tokens, and someone who knows she might be into snooping around and collecting things. But if that's a trusted friend, it's not necessarily a source of conflict.<br/><br/>You can get something like:\n<blockquote>Willow is a young Witch, very smart but a little nerdy.<br/><br/>She's a straight-A student, and she's never been in trouble for anything, so that's good.<br/><br/>She's not very popular at school, though, and the "cool kids" mock her sometimes, but she's above that - or thinks she is - for now.</blockquote>\nThe rules also tell us that she has some sympathetic tokens, but if the player chooses some not-so-interesting options, we can get a static situation like in the Actual Play: she lives with these two other people and keeps a lock of hair from each. One of them knows she does that kind of thing sometimes.<br/><br/>Going through my procedure, though, now I had to create some romantic problem for her, and "another PC is the source of the trouble" seemed to line up well with the first character's highly happy romantic life. It was an obvious connection.<br/><br/>I get your point, though. The chance of "missing" the good stuff is way way lower than I'm making it out to be. I know, and I've known that from the beginning. This discussion is really helping me get a better handle on it, though, as I think the "custom move" shows. That tool gives me more confidence, whether I'm going to play myself or help someone else learn how to play.<br/><br/>This thread has been super-helpful, I'll be sure to re-read before I play.<br/><br/>Here's another useful tip I heard from someone smart:<br/><br/>I said, "How in the world does a story with a vampire and a mermaid and a ghost all make sense? It seems so disjointed."<br/><br/>They answered, "Don't just pick playbooks at random, because you feel like it, as you could in AW. Instead, when making those choices, make them with some thought to how they fit together. For instance, in our game, we had a Ghoul--someone who had died--so another player chose to be an Angel, sent to Earth because they'd failed to prevent the Ghoul's death."<br/><br/>That's smart and really helps me understand the game, too. Now we have a reason for why <i>these</i> character types are in <i>this</i> story together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400358/#Comment_400358" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T11:38:01+00:00" title="December 10, 2012 11:38AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, cool.

Maybe I am just good at doing all my failures on my own time?<br/><br/>So, the other thing I really like about this list is that it is something to talk about. Everybody at the table reads it, has to make a decision about it, however small, so it's natural to just chat about in addition. Which is where I think you can throw in what you think about the other aspects. So the MC can ask questions about the rest and the players can be like "nope don't care" or haha whine about how they can't pick three or maybe they just do it anyway.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, when it's combined with strings, it's almost like a "second chance" to do this, if strings doesn't spark a big discussion. Like I never thought the looks sections was a big deal or anything, and then I read other people who found it to be like a super-useful tool to start envisioning their character. Or how Hx with the people I play with almost never turns into a long conversation and we figure out PC relationships more on the fly. So, huh, you might have me turned around from my original "they overlap" position here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400362/#Comment_400362" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T11:59:14+00:00" title="December 10, 2012 11:59AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's exactly how I see it:<br/><br/>It opens the floor for topics of conversation a bunch of people unfamiliar with the genre might not think of discussing. (Like how I assumed family life would never be relevant to a Monsterhearts game because I'd never seen it in the source material, but the Long Example put it on the table for me.)<br/><br/>For the MC, it gives a bunch of prompts. Like how in Apocalypse World you have a whole chapter of threat types, just to give you some ideas to work with. Except here it's still the players inventing their own trouble, which is even better.<br/><br/>Putting it last in character creation means you can painlessly skip it if you feel like you have enough material already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400380/#Comment_400380" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T16:22:28+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  4:22PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2012 4:23PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So first off, I do think this is a real thing that groups can run into. But secondly, I think part of the troublesome thinking here is that you are focusing on your own limited understanding of 'genre' -- but genre is mostly covered by the game itself. What isn't covered as much is 'being a teenager in high school' -- which is one step back from most of the 'genre' examples people are bringing up, but also of course the entire basis for the genre. (This is what Graham already pointed out, I am just amplifying the point.)<br/><br/>And while I understand that some people might play this game without much exposure to the genre fiction it's based off of, I think it's really unlikely that some people might play this game without any feelings towards, experience of, or interest in what it's like to be a teenager in high school.<br/><br/>None of the situations that the book provides, or that you are struggling to generate, or that you have written a custom chargen move about, are specific to the Monster-teenager genre. They're all just things that happen in high school. And yes, of course, they happen more often and more melodramatically in Monsterhearts, but that's because of what's actually there in the rules. The melodrama is covered, as has been pointed out, by the Strings and escalating moves and etc.<br/><br/>But the situations you want to generate aren't genre-specific. Just take any slightly fucked up or emotionally untenable situation from high school, and then watch what happens when Monsterhearts PCs have to deal with those situations <i>using only the moves Monsterhearts provides</i>. There's really almost nowhere it can go but genre-appropriate melodrama.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400393/#Comment_400393" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T18:17:41+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  6:17PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>The rules also tell us that she has some sympathetic tokens, but if the player chooses some not-so-interesting options, we can get a static situation like in the Actual Play: she lives with these two other people and keeps a lock of hair from each.

"troublesome thinking"), but I agree with everything you wrote in your post. That's <i>exactly</i> what I'm trying to get at here with this discussion, in fact. I feel that the game gives me all this stuff about monsters and moves, but it just assumes that I'll do fine coming up with the high school stuff. <br/><br/>That's what I was talking about when I wrote:\n<blockquote>Basically, I'm looking at Monsterhearts a little bit like Dogs in the Vineyard: "Here are some tools you can use to change things (the gun and the Book of Life vs. your monstrous self and your weird-ass moves, your gang, etc)." The idea behind this custom move is that helps me ground the characters in real-life problems that their tools are *really* not suited to fixing: the equivalent to Town Creation. <br/><br/>It's just that, in Monsterhearts (unlike Apocalypse World and Dogs), those problems aren't about troubled communities or the world at large: they're all about self-centered, personal problems inherent to the characters' private lives and they way the view themselves.</blockquote>\nMonsterhearts, to me, looks like a game where, hey, you're a teenager in high school, and that sucks. But here, you have some weird supernatural stuff to play with. Let's see where that leads! (Hint: nowhere good.)<br/><br/>I'd like the Situation in play and the material I'm drawing on to be all about the regular person high school stuff, and I'm finding that the game doesn't seem to give a lot of support to that, given its focus on the supernatural.<br/><br/>What you wrote there sounds like exactly the way I'm thinking about this game.

A quirky situation is just a string that hasn't been pulled hard enough by the MC. If a situation is uninteresting, it seems to me that at the MC hasn't asked provocative questions. Look at the AP you posted. No provocative questions. Steve has strings. Evelyn has a token. These two have a relationship. Tia caught Evelyn going through her things. But then we're off dealing with the police at the door.<br/><br/>MC: "So, you have a lock of Bobby's hair? I see. WHY? Are you planning to cast some kind of magic hex on him? Why would you be preparing to do that?<br/>Sabine: "No I would never do that to Bobby. He's my friend."<br/><br/>But, we know the witch has a loaded gun pointed right at Bobby. If Bobby's an NPC, the MC's job is to make him so monstrous that she pulls the trigger. If he's a PC, then the MC looks for other ways to put the screws to their relationship until Sabine slips into her Darkest Self and things really hit the fan.<br/><br/>MC: So, Suzy, you know that Sabine has a lock of Bobby's hair. How do you know that? Were you spying on her? Did you sneak into her room one night and go through her things? And, most importantly, How did it make you feel about Sabine? You didn't tell anyone did you?<br/><br/>Now we're starting to put a loaded gun in Suzy's hand. All she has to do is blurt out in an argument with Sabine, loud enough to be overheard, that she's a hair-stealing freak who's obviously crushing on Bobby. What's Bobby's girlfriend going to do with that?<br/><br/>It's high school turned to 11. The PCs are all looking for love and validation from people that they have reason to hate and distrust, including themselves. Especially themselves.<br/><br/>The witch, her talents are only good for destroying the people closest to her. The Queen? She's nothing without her gang of fickle sycophants. The Fae is constantly trusting people to keep their word and is constantly disappointed. The Chosen is up against impossible odds, trying to live up to impossible standards.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400426/#Comment_400426" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T00:04:06+00:00" title="December 11, 2012 12:04AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, sympathetic tokens are problematic &amp; messy by their very nature.

Even if they pick a boring sympathetic token, the fact that it's a sympathetic token in the first place makes it weird and interesting.<br/><br/>And having a collection of locks of hair that you stole from people in your class?

(What follows are just random observations and experiences YMMV)<br/><br/>I don't think an MH MC will have a problem with material if they ask the right questions of the players so that players start the game with something their characters want. You really don't need much for an evening's play and trying to squeeze in too many issues can make the game feel rushed and superficial. <br/><br/>You can tell from player responses to your questions whether or not the question you've chosen is going to be a hot button topic. They often seek to adjust, clarify or add to the elements created by the questions when they are interested in something. Once you hit on something at least one player really goes for, you have insta-story and the game will just about run itself in my experience. <br/><br/>I've not had problems with material, I've had more problems with player disappointment about not getting to explore certain issues. <br/><br/><br/>I use the following a lot...There is nothing wrong with not detailing something cool beforehand. You can stop the game at some point to detail it or make it up on the fly once you have other material for context. This is kinda like "Draw maps, leave blanks" from DW.   <br/><br/>The best games of MH I've had involved the players initially playing playing a pure high school story with the monster thing on the periphery. Having it on the periphery means that one of the players (including the MC) can bring it back with a vengeance just when it's most convenient for the players. <br/><br/>The not-so-great games of MH I've had have involved the players are trying to be monstrous to each other, to NPCs and in public from the outset with no build-up. I had one game where someone tore someone up in front of witnesses who then put a video up on the web. The game turned into "Monster Police Chase Across Sydney". *sigh*<br/><br/>My games of AW are about relationships but are otherwise about the threats the characters face. There can be a strong external focus in AW. (This varies by player and exact setting and group dynamic of course)<br/><br/>My games of MH are about relationships too but they have a far more inward focus and I really push hard to keep them that way. In my games, I find "What do you do?" to not be the best question sometimes.  I ask "How do you feel?" instead or before asking the former. <br/><br/>Sometimes ask players how their characters feel out of immediate context to really help the players into their characters heads. Teenagers have mood swings after all.... <br/><br/>When I'm a player in  MH rather than the MC, I sort of treat my PC like a stolen car...  When deciding how to respond to something, I imagine myself as a teenager who thinks the whole world revolves around them and who has very little self control. I have the best time in this game when I make bad decisions.<br/><br/>YMMV of course. These are just my observations about what might be my favourite game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400448/#Comment_400448" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T07:26:45+00:00" title="December 11, 2012  7:26AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            StuMc,<br/><br/>That's fantastic!

Monsterhearts doesn't ache for lots of outside adversity, and so it doesn't make sense to have a big complicated structure for that adversity.<br/><br/>Menaces feel like the right amount of complicated. You write one up when you have a really good idea for one. There are either one or several threats, and each has three moves attached to it (Craving/Offering/Capacity). Make those moves whenever you'd make any other moves, as you see fit. Add a custom move if you see fit. Done.<br/><br/>Menaces are essentially a set of prompts/supports for introducing and handling outside adversity, should you feel the need to do so. Coals/Flames were a complicated management game for the MC to handle adversity, and they frankly didn't add anything or work in context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401879/#Comment_401879" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T20:12:38+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  8:12PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Joe!<br/><br/>I didn't realize those Coals and things were external forces.

It's just so easy for the players to come up with their own trouble and create their own messy situations with a little prompting. Just reading through the descriptions of certain moves (and especially Darkest Self and Sex Moves) inspired a lot of stuff for us.<br/><br/>However, at the same time, I do find certain parts of it difficult, and would have found those things a lot MORE difficult before I checked out some of the source fiction Joe suggested in this thread. And those are more or less the parts I was worried about.<br/><br/>We used "It All Ends in Tears", which really helped people get into the game right away without first having to discuss the genre or understand what kinds of problems were appropriate and which wouldn't be a good fit. It's not a bad way to start a game; I'm very happy with how it worked out.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to trying some of the other methods I brainstormed here, as well. They all approach the problem a little differently, and would give different payoffs.<br/><br/>The IaWA oracle concept might be fruitful - in many ways, a really important aspect of M&lt;3s (and which separates it from AW and a lot of other story games) is how the game is really fundamentally a PvP kind of engine. (Although that could mean seduction and love just as much as it could betrayal and murder.) The NPCs exist to "blanket in darkness" and to force wedges between the characters, to put pressure on their relationships.<br/><br/>I would imagine that putting the characters slightly less "pointed at each other" is better for a simmering, long-term game - and outside concerns and interests, like a Menace, help with that. I would also imagine that pointing them more directly at each other might be better for an intense one-shot kind of game. But that's just me theorizing right now.<br/><br/>Like Joe says, the game's about people anxious to get at each other's throats and at each other's belt buckles. The story's about them.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17660/monsterhearts-vs-apocalypse-world-missing-mc-advice-or-procedures" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17660/monsterhearts-vs-apocalypse-world-missing-mc-advice-or-procedures" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17660/monsterhearts-vs-apocalypse-world-missing-mc-advice-or-procedures/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17660%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17660%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
