Imagine that the basic rule of the game is "Toss a coin when your character does something; on a heads, they succeed and on a tails, they fail." Are you happy that everyone has the same chance at everything, all the time? Or do you want to pick abilities for your character that let them toss more coins, for an increased chance of success under the right circumstances?<br/><br/>Would it make a difference if, instead of a random system like tossing coins, you had a more tactical system where the player had to choose whether or not to spend a resource? Or played "Rock-Paper-Scissors" against their opponent to see who succeeded?<br/><br/>This is mostly about short games and mini-games, not necessarily full-sized games for campaigning: is the trade off in the simplicity &amp; speed of the rules worth it for the lack of definition between characters?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446020/#Comment_446020" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-08T10:52:52+00:00" title="July  8, 2015 10:52AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Being particularly good at something is probably only going to be important if the game is about being good at things.

However, in that case your game can't be all about "how competent is your character" (which is arguably the focus of a lot of mainstream RPGs).<br/><br/>What matters, though, is <i>how people play the game.</i> <br/><br/>Having everything decided by a coin flip doesn't give you any differentiation between characters, true. But it also - and more importantly:<br/><br/>1. Doesn't give you differentiation between players. (Unless the game is made so that you can choose character actions which allow you to avoid coin flips, or change what's at stake, of course.)<br/><br/>As a counter-example, consider Dread (the Jenga one). Here, outcomes are decided in a way which doesn't differentiate between characters: but now your skill as a player is important. The way to make your *character* more competent is to make better pulls than your friend.<br/><br/>2. Doesn't give any weight to the <i>way</i> in which your character does something. Do they do it carefully? Are they willing to take great risks? Do they try to make sure circumstances are in their favour before they act?<br/><br/>If fighting 20 armed guards is a coin flip, and running away or hiding from them until they leave is also a coin flip, my decision to fight or run or hide becomes almost irrelevant: it's just colour narration. <br/><br/>That means people are going to make decisions differently in your game: based on how they want things to look, or how it will affect their character portrayal (after all, in the above example, the only reason to try hiding rather than fighting is to show that your character is a coward, or overly cautious, or is good at hiding)... not based on what you think is most likely to succeed.<br/><br/>Character ability isn't the issue here; the issue is <i>how does this design choice affect the way people play this game</i>? <br/><br/>...and then the real question is: <br/><br/>"Does that support or undermine my design goals and/or creative goals/agenda?"<br/><br/><br/><i>*: Note that, in <b>Penny for My Thoughts</b>, you can have very competent characters and very incompetent characters. It's just not decided by a die roll or coin flip - it's up to the choices the players make.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446038/#Comment_446038" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-08T15:49:35+00:00" title="July  8, 2015  3:49PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll add another question: what are your players like?<br/><br/>I know the op question mainly revolves around mechanics, but it has always been my focus to consider social interaction into the mechanics as much as possible.<br/><br/>My point here is that, taking the D&amp;D example, the wizard may be able to do everything and more better than the rest of the party, but if her player is less inclined to roleplaying and the fighter's player is more inclined to it, you'll probably see both have the same amount of spotlight and fun (I'm being optimistic, I know we've all seen the opposite but let's not go there, i'm already derrailing the thread enough)<br/><br/>Does this affect the game design-wise?. For optimal Flow and reaching a wider audience, I'd say yes, it should. Of course it's easier to just design the game you want to play with the people you know full well and let the audience out there find out if they like it or not; but if you can design at least a few procedures to help players sort that problem, that'll be awesome.<br/><br/>Here's an idea on how to implement that: in the character creation part, include a procedure to create a narrative niche for the character, as in "once a player has chosen a combination of background features, no other player can choose the same combination, nor have more that one feature in common". Then, make the use of race and class features optional, free for everyone and unrestricted by requirements so GMs interested in balance can disregard that part, and players interested in the mechanical character building can build whatever they want. <br/><br/>Worried about mechanical game balance? use the AW core: when players roll poorly, the GM makes a move. That way it doesn't matter how many skills the player has, each time they roll a dice, something will happen, and the more they roll, the more interesting things will happen. That solved about 70% of my problems with game balance.<br/><br/>Of course, there are a lot of other ways and as I stated before, you can also totally disregard this and just make the game you want to play with the people you know better.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446039/#Comment_446039" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-08T16:25:09+00:00" title="July  8, 2015  4:25PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good points, thanks folks. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The deciding factors seem to be the type of game you're playing and whether it uses strongly defined roles for the characters: a game about escorting a Witch to Lindisfarne can be an action-adventure, with the characters facing hordes of demons intent on freeing the Witch, in which case I expect characters to be differentiated by skills &amp; abilities... or, on the other hand, the story can focus on the personalities of the PCs, their histories &amp; motivations, so the differentiation comes from the way they are portrayed, not what they can do.<br/><br/>There's also the issue of target numbers and difficulty modifiers: as Paul_T points out, if the chances of success are the same no matter what I do, then the only things influencing my choice are how I want my character to be perceived and what the optimal choice is in any situation.<br/><br/>The alternative to skills &amp; abilities is motivations: instead of being better at doing a thing, you're better if doing that thing is in accord with your personality or situation, e.g. if the 20 armed guards stand between you and your goal, then you might do better attacking them than running away, but you would do equally well trying to sneak past them, bribe them, disguise yourself as a guard, bluff them into believing you have an army behind you, etc. Fictional positioning comes into this strongly, so you are 'better' if your approach to the problem is more plausible and you have laid more groundwork for it.<br/><br/><b>TLDR:</b> 'better' can be about the story and not the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446040/#Comment_446040" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-08T17:06:09+00:00" title="July  8, 2015  5:06PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Yet another approach is balancing character success with other factors - in Primetime Adventures, it's whether you're the focal character of a particular episode or not; in games like the Pool it's about how important the player thinks a certain action might or might not be; yet in other situations it could a question of gambling - how much are you willing to put on the line for this?)<br/><br/>(An example: When you do something, roll one die.

If it isn't then something is off about the scenario or situation.<br/><br/>But then when you add in players and characters then often 50/50 doesn't feel satisfying.  Answering when and why it doesn't feel satisfying for THIS game is, in fact, game design.<br/><br/>And that's assuming you've accepted randomization as an element of this game at all.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
