It completely depends on the context in which he heard it (which he'd forgotten).  An indie gamer friend gave one possible definition and I riffed off of that (so as not to seem ignorant of my own hobby).  But I did say that it really depended on the context and I was struggling with it.<br/><br/>Are there any other words you can substitute into the sentence that maybe you would struggle with?<br/><br/>Edit: Just to clarify I'm not primarily asking what Narrative gaming means but highlighting the vocabulary gap that I see gamers struggle against.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410116/#Comment_410116" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T12:03:29+00:00" title="March 22, 2013 12:03PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I try to just use neutral terms, and explain what I think are the most important (e.g. fun) differences for me -- e.g. for narrative stuff, I'd talk about distributed authority and collaborative creativity and the like -- even though narrative games don't necessarily need to possess those qualities, I just frame it in terms of "oh, the games that I like that people call narrative, this is what I like about them that you won't see in D&amp;D or Traveller."  I'd probably throw in "rules light," and then follow that with "but not all the games are rules light, and some of the games have rules for stuff you wouldn't expect in D&amp;D, like player ownership of motifs" and then I'd talk about Annalise and Universalis or the like.<br/><br/>If a story gamer asked me why I enjoyed Savage Worlds, I could talk about the enjoyment of discovering and exploring the world that someone else has spent time creating -- you could talk about this in terms of more reading a book than writing one together, but that's not really dismissive -- it's not like roleplaying necessarily has to be creative in order to be fun.  There's also an aspect of "us against them" and competition and a sense of urgency that is present in a different way than it is in more collaborative games.  And again -- it's not like this is true for all gamist style gaming, but it's the part that appeals to me and that I can describe with some degree of passion, that sort of deal.<br/><br/>Anyway, ultimately, it's a fairly huge question, I just frame it by saying "these are the aspects that I like of what you just asked me about," and I follow it up with "but, just like D&amp;D, lots of people have lots of definitions on just what playing a game means."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410125/#Comment_410125" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T13:22:38+00:00" title="March 22, 2013  1:22PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd answer like this:\n<blockquote><br/>When groups play together, they either all agree on what's important for play, or they don't. If they all have different ideas of what makes a game awesome, then no one will be happy all the time and possibly, someone will be unhappy a big part of the time. <br/><br/>I don't know where you heard about "narrative gaming," so I'm not sure what those people were talking about. However, there's a term called "Narrativist" gaming, sometimes called "Story Now" gaming, and its one kind of play to aim for. Like, imagine you're playing some old version of D&amp;D or something and the cleric refuses to heal your fighter because you tortured the orc, and the cleric's player is making a point about his RL feelings about torture. But you're playing it more for the challenge of survival and you're all into optimization and making the best tactical moves. Maybe an occasional moral statement is fine in that game, but if you never play the way the cleric's player does, he's not getting what he wants most out of the game, and if the cleric's player never cares about tactics and optimization ("so what if we all died? it just goes to prove my point about man's inhumanity to man!"), you're gonna get frustrated eventually.<br/><br/>Or at least, you know, not have the best game you could have.<br/><br/>Narrativism is more about playing to tell a *meaningful* story, even if you all die. It's more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it.<br/></blockquote>\nWell, actually, I'd start with, "Are you sure you want to know? It's really complicated and I might be able to explain it without a lot of jargon, but maybe not. It's a specific kind of RPG play, but if you're having fun already, who cares?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410127/#Comment_410127" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T13:42:18+00:00" title="March 22, 2013  1:42PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a kind of surreal experience this past weekend.<br/><br/>I met up with a guy I haven't talked to in a decade, who I used to game with.

I heard some people talk about narrative gaming one time... I've only played D&amp;D and a bit of Traveller. What's this narrative gaming mean? I didn't really understand it."<br/>   Okay. Back in the day I "played D&amp;D and a bit of Traveller" ( I still have books "0: an introduction to Traveller" through "5: High Guard" and others including "Adventure 1: Kinunir" for the win!). I had Deities and DemiGods when it still included Lovecraft and Moorcock. Cthulhu AND Stormbringer in the same setting? Really?! <br/>  In full disclosure, I started my own home-brew game as a response to the fact that these games did NOT represent the fiction that they purported to represent (Traveller Supplement 4 : all the stats on Vader, Luke, Harry Mudd, Jame Retief, John Carter, and even the Stainless Steel Rat by Harrison ... in Traveller stats - how evocative!).<br/><br/> Okay, I know I'm the new guy here but (always that big sexy BUTT) - none of these responses are useful to a guy in a bar. It's not that I don't agree with them BUT!-<br/>  Me - "Ya see the Lord Of The Rings ?"<br/>  Guy/Gal in Pub ( here-after "Gip") "Sure"<br/>  Me - "Who's your favorite character?"<br/>  Gip - "Well, I read the books, too. Always kinda liked Sam"<br/>  Me - "Sure. But what is he in (game of your choice - level; class; etc)<br/>  Gip - "Well. I don't know-"<br/>  Me - "Okay, but he's really not the equal of the Wizard, or the Ranger, or the Elf or the Dwarf of even that sexy Elven NPC who rides in and-"<br/>  Gip- "Well, no ..."<br/>  Me - "BUTT (you know what you're thinking!) he's one of the characters who completes the quest. <br/>  Gip- "Sure, but that's the story. He's written that way."<br/>  You- "Fair enough. But what I'm saying is: what allowed him to get so far? What was it about Sam that MADE him a protagonist? His Strength? Dexterity? Basket Weaving skill?"<br/>  Gip- "Well, he's loyal to Frodo-<br/>  Me- "Yes, exactly. That's ONE aspect of the character. Is Gandalf loyal to Frodo?<br/> Gip- " Of course-<br/> Me- "But isn't Gandalf more loyal to the Quest first? He's been working on it for 2,000 years! Didn't he send Bilbo to a dragon's lair? And Aragorn, what is his primary motivation? Ring or King? At what point is he willing to give up the Quest? What of Borimir? Pippin and Merry both took on new loyalties. And loyalty is just ONE aspect we're talking about (such as between Gimli and Legolas). <br/> Gip- "So, narrative gaming is all about "who completes the Grail Quest"?<br/> Me- "Maybe. Is that important to your Character? Is that important to you?"<br/> Gip - "Nah, I just wanna go out and fight things and, ya know, get stuff."<br/>  Me- "Fair enough. But when you kill the goblins and get the Golden Idol, it turns out it's cursed! It's slowly turning you Undead, at odds with all your party, BUT it's giving you awesome powers!"<br/> Gip- "Oh, no! Not falling for that! If I'm Undead I can't be an adventurer."<br/> Me- "What if you could. All you have to do is kill another party member..."<br/>  Gip- "Uhm - what do I roll for that?"<br/> Me- "Just your soul... We're gonna need another round of drinks over here."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410186/#Comment_410186" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T23:50:11+00:00" title="March 22, 2013 11:50PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "biffboff!" sounds like the kind of sound effect you should put in a comic after the delivery of such an awesome post.<br/><br/>And it definitely applies here!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StuMc" title="StuMc"><img alt="StuMc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StuMc">StuMc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410197/#Comment_410197" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T02:30:54+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  2:30AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post biffboff.

When they tracked down a person of interest while he was trespassing in someone else's home, one of the players said, "I shoot him in the leg." When everybody else looked at him like he was crazy, he said, "What? We're never going to see these people again."<br/><br/>Everybody was looking at him like he was crazy because they were playing it like it's a story, like their characters were real people. This guy was playing it like a game to be won, where nobody bats an eye if you torture someone for information in an innocent family's home if that's just the quickest way to achieve your objective. (And it's never been clear to me whether he meant "our characters will never see these people again" or "we [the players] will never see these people again because the game will be over soon," but I suspect the latter.) This kind of shows the distinction between playing RPGs as "narrative gaming" versus what some players might actually consider more "traditional." In games like that, you're allowed to act like a sociopath as long as your job title is "hero."</i></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410273/#Comment_410273" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T18:58:49+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  6:58PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like people here are focusing on Narrativism and playstyles instead of "<i>narrative gaming</i>" as a phrase.

Naturally, they wanna know what that means. I keep it short and sweet and just sorta say "I like games where motivation matters more than lots of rules. A lot of the time these games have rule sets that are specific to the type of stories they're made for, so they do one thing and do it really well." <br/><br/>If you interact with a lot of 'trad gamers' or people who've only sort-of-heard-about RPGs, you'll find that they genuinely don't understand what could possibly be so different about a storygame (and why shouldn't they just try the <i>setting</i> of that game, but using the d20 rules they already know?).

Now I'm probably going to shoot myself in the foot and put said bloody appendage firmly in my mouth. I find the topic (and responses) both intriguing and puzzling. Stripped of the jargon, so many responses are muddled and leave ME confused as to what a Story Game definition is.  The OP said "Are there any other words you can substitute into the sentence that maybe you would struggle with?" But what sentence? He doesn't actually give HIS response. He wants to describe how a Story Game differs from a "traditional" RPG (Hell, let's just assume D+D) but " I'm not primarily asking what Narrative gaming means but highlighting the vocabulary gap that I see gamers struggle against. " Describe a Story Game in simple terms without saying what Narrative gaming means? No wonder we're struggling!<br/><br/>One definition of Narrative is a string of connected events. I don't generally like extremes but they can be useful for illustration purposes. On the far left, a story game engages Characters with other characters, with plot, even with themselves (Man against Nature, Man against Himself, etc). On the far right, a "traditional" RPG engages with the rules. At the back of the AD+D DM Guide their is a random dungeon generator. You roll to determine passages and rooms and you roll to determine traps and monsters (and, by extension, loot). The dungeon ends when every passage and room is closed off (no more exits). <br/><br/>"That's a pretty lame dungeon"<br/>"Oh, hey Gip. Didn't see you there."<br/>"Who were you just talking to?"<br/>"Doesn't matter. But yeah, at least this dungeon should have a theme, right? Say- Undead? Everybody likes Undead. Or 'Things that return that should be left to lie"<br/>"-groan-"<br/>"And we can assume the tone of this dungeon would be dark and grim."<br/>"Yeah, yeah. I get it. Theme, Tone, story elements. What next? Characters?"<br/>"Hmm, not yet. Don't these dungeons usually have a Big Bad Guy or McGuffin? Let's do both! A lich guarding a golden idol!"<br/>"Not that again!"<br/>"Don't worry. Your just there to retrieve it. Character motivation, and all that. Hey, maybe your character needs it to buy a tavern."<br/>"Kinda always wanted a tavern..."<br/>"Okay, but the tavern owner only wants the idol. Random loot won't cut it. Now, you need companions. Let's say there's a Paladin. He's coming along because you once saved him and he owes you his life."<br/>"Sure. Whatever."<br/>"No. Not 'whatever'. He gets a bonus anytime he intervenes to save you"<br/>"WooHoo! That's a Character motivation I can get on board with!"<br/>"Of course, he comes with the usual Paladin baggage. He'll probably want to slay the lich."<br/>"Gotta do what ya gotta do. 's all good"<br/>"Now, your other companion is a cleric. Useful in a dungeon of Undead. She's there specifically to kill the lich; an abomination to her faith."<br/>"Cool. Let's go!"<br/>"Here's the thing your character doesn't realize, though: the cleric knows that in order to destroy the lich, she must destroy the idol."<br/>"Whoah, whoah! I need that idol. I think this cleric is gonna get fragged along the way."<br/>"Well, first off, I doubt the Paladin will allow that. He owes you HIS life, not the cleric's. Second, your character doesn't know this. Maybe during a rest, you could discuss-"<br/>"Screw that noise. We're still in the tavern, right? I'll ply her with drinks and get her to talk."<br/>"But you haven't even gone to the dungeon yet."<br/>"The dungeon can wait. This shit's important! And, hey, what does the tavern keeper want with this idol, anyway?"<br/>"Gip, you're a filthy hippie Story gamer..."<br/><br/>The dirty, ugly truth is that Story Gaming has been around as long as the hobby has; not because of the Rules - but in spite of them. We are all 50 shades of Grey Wizard. We are all Sneetches, some with stars on thars and some without. We are all Gip to some-one else. That Guy in the Bar may have played in more awesome stories than you or I. Let's make up jargon to separate us. Let's shout "system matters!".

I made the thread because in my experience gamers suck at talking about gaming and I want to know why.  <br/><br/>"I know you're into gaming... I heard some people talk about <b>conflict resolution</b> one time... I've only played D&amp;D and a bit of Traveller. What's this <b>conflict resolution</b> mean? I didn't really understand it."<br/><br/>"I know you're into gaming... I heard some people talk about <b>player priorities</b> one time... I've only played D&amp;D and a bit of Traveller. What's this <b>player priorities</b> mean? I didn't really understand it."<br/><br/>I'm reading a really good book at the moment called Characteristics of Games and it's about defining characteristics that board games, sports and computer games have.  (And even a lot of the subject matter there has not been looked at a lot.)  I think that a lot of the definitions that the roleplaying game community has for the characteristics of RPGs are quite controversial due to their prescriptive nature (rather than descriptive).<br/><br/>My own loosey goosey definition of a narrative game is one in which the game itself asks "why?" with respect to choices the players make and the answers matter to the rules of the game.  <br/><br/>In my mind the traditional game is the physics simulator, rules are interpreted by the players and they check to see if they offend the physics simulator.  Maybe some rule that is story-game-like won't offend the physics simulator like say a fate point currency as you can say that it represents a full on effort or something. The interpretation of some rules will offend the physics simulator like say, the Player's Turn in Mouse Guard.  If the physics simulator is sufficiently offended the game ceases to be traditional.<br/><br/><b>But this isn't the most important subject to this topic.</b>  Why can we all spend so much effort on definitions and not get anywhere?  Sometimes you tell a guy that D&amp;D isn't the best system to use for a modern political game, and he hears "D&amp;D is a bad system and you are a bad gamer: I personally attack your gamer credentials and do not value you as a person!"  That happens just when somebody has asked you a question about what a word means in the pub.  I just wanted to talk about gaming.<br/><br/><br/>You want to know what I think? (Oh boy, this'll get me taken off the christmas card lists!)<br/><br/>A big subset of gamers put too much of their own identities in identifying as a particular kind of gamer.  Gamers are active, they expend effort to play and it's really cool.  It's deeply investing just by doing it and the player has a great time in a sheltered little community of groups.<br/><br/>But this guy wants to talk to someone else outside of the community and tries to share opinions and ideas, which are all formed by highly personal anecdotes and experiences, and so the person lacks the perspective and lexicon to do so effectively.  This reinforces the unique identity of the guy to terms that change meaning from person to person.<br/><br/>When this guy is met with someone who challenges these opinions then it routes back to the experiences and onto the identity.  Effectively, the person becomes upset because a difference of opinion has directly attacked self-identification.  Which makes every little discussion inherently personal.  And then we get folks offended over nothing.<br/><br/>It's like everyone starts off broken the moment they declare themselves to be a roleplayer.<br/><br/>Now that I've had my little rant I'd like you to go back over it and re-imagine it but this time with me as the subject rather than as the ranter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410296/#Comment_410296" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T06:26:32+00:00" title="March 24, 2013  6:26AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Let's make up jargon to separate us.

Some people hated what it was doing. They all agreed though that it was different enough that some means was needed to tag that kind of game and that kind of play to differentiate it from that parent trunk of the gaming hobby.<br/><br/>So someone suggested Roleplaying Game. It was a placeholder term and nothing more, but it stuck.

Same situation, same response.<br/><br/>On the upside, that split, indicated by the change in jargon, ends up leading to RPGs truly diversifying in mechanics and playstyle, going beyond being just a single figure miniatures campaign game with a tradition of talking like your character every now and again.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410320/#Comment_410320" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T12:06:12+00:00" title="March 24, 2013 12:06PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">@TotallyGuy</a>  First things first. I didn't realize that the sentence you were referring to was Guy's. I thought it was your explanatory sentence (which wasn't written) to his sentence/question. That's my bad. <br/> I think we're very much in agreement. You say 'the game itself asks "why?"'; I say it 'engages the Character'. In both cases we are really talking about the Player. Character and game are just tools to frame that "why".<br/> You say 'physics simulator'; I say 'Random Dungeon Generator'. We can pick at nits but the tree will never show us where the forest is, no matter how close we look at it.<br/> I say 'people are passionate about their games'; you say 'people are passionate about their games'.

Segues nicely to komradebob's comment.<br/><br/>Out of courtesy (rather than hubris), I will assume you are reading this, komradebob, and write directly instead of in the third person, as though you weren't even in the room. Did I detect a slight hint of offense at my reference to "system matters"? Or was it the "filthy hippie" remark? If you care (and I'm not saying you do and I'm not saying you don't - God! Being totally PC is tedious!)  I am a filthy hippie who thinks system matters BUT only insofar as it enhances play. In fact, I think that was the whole point of system matters. "But my Game Master can run any system and make it fun." I can quote that whole fictional conversation Ron had - almost verbatim. Insightful stuff. Your post rails (too strong a word?) against elitism and divisiveness. But that was the point of my post, too; that we are not as different as we perceive or believe.<br/><br/>And that segues nicely back to you, TotallyGuy. - 'and he hears "D&amp;D is a bad system and you are a bad gamer: I personally attack your gamer credentials and do not value you as a person!" '. Again, gotta agree. It's this PERCIEVED difference that leads to miscommunication. Then again, some people are just jerks. Substitute religion/politics/ crunchy or smooth peanut butter for 'gamer' in that sentiment and- well, you have the internet (especially YouTube commenters; man, those people are ANGRY!!! ). Don't engage 'that Guy', just ... don't; not in a bar, not in a car, not in a boat, not even with a goat!<br/><br/>I wonder, did anyone reading this NOT get the Sneetches reference? I sometimes forget that I'm old. 'The Sneetches ' is a wonderful little story about divisiveness. It really speaks to the heart of the matter. Personally, I think it's okay that someone thinks their game is better than mine; that's just opinion and you should love your game! It's when someone thinks their game is better because my game is shit! - well, not even with a goat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410325/#Comment_410325" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T13:23:17+00:00" title="March 24, 2013  1:23PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, it's really just that I think  it's funny how history repeats itself ( or at least people act with similar behavior repeatedly and collectively). On one hand I think it can be frustrating. On the other, sometimes horrible behavior leads to something really interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
