I don't have a great deal of time to fit gaming into my schedule, so I've been looking for a quick to read, quicker to prep and even quicker to explain game. Mike's AP sounded like it fit the bill, so I checked it out and decided that I had to run it (Chalk up another punter sold on the game by the face dice!). I prepped a quick three act hack 'n slasher over the weekend and ran it for a small group at my campus' gaming society. Most of the members are board gamers, but there are a decent number of roleplayers as well as some people with no gaming experience. This was the first game I'd run at the club.<br/><br/>I had four players of varying RPG experience from virtually none to lots. I had them roll stats, then I gave a one sentence summary of each of the classes and each of the attributes and had them to choose a class in ascending order of stat totals. The characters were:<br/><br/>Andreas Nicolio (Magus); Alertness 3, Daring 1, Eloquence 4, Sneakiness 1, Size -1, Stubbornness 3; Illusions; light weapon, light armour, cloak of stealth.<br/>Luna (Mystic); Alertness 3, Daring 1, Eloquence 1, Sneakiness 0, Size -1, Stubbornness 3; Raven Companion; light weapon, light armour, broomstick.<br/>Ursa Major (Bear); Alertness 0, Daring 3 (rerolled from -1), Eloquence -1, Sneakiness 0, Size 3, Stubbornness 0; Mighty Grip; very heavy reach weapon, heavy armour, perfect teeth.<br/>The Red Herring (Longrunner); Alertness 0, Daring 0, Eloquence 3, Sneakiness 2, Size 2, Stubbornness 2; Bird feet; heavy weapon, heavy armour, grappling hook.<br/><br/>In the first act, the characters approached a town obviously affected by a some sort of magical blight. On the hills overlooking the cursed valley stood a ruined tower surrounded by glowing yellow clouds. The townsfolk told them that until a few months ago the tower had been occupied by a reclusive wizard, but that it had exploded and shortly thereafter the magical blight had begun to afflict their town. Being brave adventurers well aware of a plot hook when it strikes them roughly in the face, they headed immediately for the tower.<br/><br/>On the way (the second act), they encountered a strange and arrogant magus with a small band of foreign eunuch bodyguards in a clearing. One thing led to another which led to a fight:<br/>Arrogant Wizard (Magus 2); Alertness 1, Daring 3, Eloquence 1, Sneakiness 0, Size 0, Stubbornness 5; Blast, Illusions; light weapon, light armour; 5 HP (20XP)<br/>8 unarmoured Mooks withe heavy weapons<br/>[I statted this guy as a level 2 NPC and assigned him XP as a monster. In retrospect, I should have given him 10hp like a monster.]<br/>At the beginning of the fight, I explained Showing Off and the other fight actions. Two PCs immediately attempted to show off, but both rolled less that 8. Mwahaha! When the dust cleared, all but one character were on 1 or 2 hp (and The Red Herring scored the killing blow), so they returned to the town and told the townsfolk that the wizard had been the source of their problems. By the time the townsfolk had realised that they hadn't solved the problem at all, our brave humanitarians were off up the mountain again.<br/><br/>The third and final act  began with a fight between the PCs and a neverending supply of unarmoured, unremarkably weaponed imp mook who popped into exsistence near the tower and swooped down on the PCs. When they entered the tower, a Drake appeared:<br/>Drake; Alertness 3, Daring 3, Eloquence -1, Sneakiness 1, Size 7, Stubbornness 2; Thick skin, Internal Fire, Flight, Vicious, Blast, Heavy weapon, heavy armour; 10hp (40XP)<br/>Fortunately for the PCs they were never all in the same arena, so the Drake's Blast wasn't as useful as it could have been. Ursa Major was the first and only to be taken down, and Luna's raven swooped in for the killing blow (I gave Luna the XP). Ursa Major required a healer, but survived, so all but one character scored a bonus +5XP from something, and thus leveled with 101XP.<br/><br/>We played the whole thing in about 2 hours. I only had 2 d12s, but plenty of d10s, so pretty early on I houseruled that all skill tests would be done on d10s (I presume the d12 skill checks are only there to give some love to the much maligned d12?). Once I got to the showing off table I realised that I'd need to adjust the table or keep the d12s, so I reintroduced the d12s for that test. That resulted in a certain amount of ceremony as the showing off player took and rolled the special dice. I intentionally made the adventure very simple and combat heavy in order to give everyone plenty of time with the combat system. I didn't throw in very many non-combat challenges.<br/><br/>The players were buzzing after the game, and when I stated my intention to run it regularly at the Monday meetings, it was pointed out to me that there is a Thursday meeting as well!<br/>Flawless victory, RBH wins!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21" title="Sean ov Newcastle !"><img alt="Sean ov Newcastle !" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21">Sean ov Newcastle !</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122709/#Comment_122709" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T10:51:50+00:00" title="January 29, 2008 10:51AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome !<br/><br/>I'd be interested to know how you did the arenas for the fight with the Drake.

I didn't define the connections, but they were all pretty much as you'd expect. Next week I think I'll do something with a dungeon and play around with the Arenas more carefully.<br/><br/>I was allowing the Longrunner to jump through arenas and attack a creature in the arena he passed through, so he made a few attacks into the Air around Tower, but the rest of the action took place in the Ground around Tower arena, especially as non of the characters were armed with a ranged weapon. I forgot to mention that new Imps continuously appeared until the eponymous Gem guarded by the Drake was removed from a pedestal atop the tower. So some of the PCs were running to get that.<br/><br/>The player of the Longrunner was totally sold on Bird feet; he was calling out regularly across the room to his friends playing a card game to describe cool things he was doing with it (excited players is the best advertising!). The other players made use of their talents in every act. I don't think anyone felt like their talent was useless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21" title="Sean ov Newcastle !"><img alt="Sean ov Newcastle !" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21">Sean ov Newcastle !</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123070/#Comment_123070" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T12:09:51+00:00" title="January 30, 2008 12:09PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, my players seem enamoured with the talents too.

One night, the town is attacked by unknown human assailants who kidnap Andreas Nicolio (the Magus - absent for a session) and escape with the Gem. I dealt with the town pretty broadly as five of neutral arenas with plenty of opportunity for arena creation if desired. The assailants attempted to storm the house of the young chief-in-waiting, a tight arena which played into the hands of the light-weapon-armed Luna (Mystic) and her light-weapon-armed Raven companion (now statted as +3 Alertness, +2 Sneakiness, +1 Stubbornness and -1 Size). The assailants were all mooks and the damage from the fight was easily Heartsung away with some great improvised Disney-style lyrics to the tune of Kumbaya.<br/><br/>Naturally, the PCs pursue the kidnappers. The (renamed) Red Hunter (Longrunner) runs off up the river (literally, with Bird feet) after the retreating "bandits" while Ursa Major (Bear) and Luna follow at human/bear pace. The Red Hunter passes a covered bridge and soon catches a bunch of six stragglers. Confident in his ability against six mooks, he leaps in from the treetops and kills two with a surprise attack. The four mooks respond with a one point hit, a miss, a two consecutive hits to the face, dropping the Longrunner (+5 xp!). Meanwhile, back in the forest...<br/><br/>Ursa Major and Luna approach the bridge and discover it occupied by a large monster - The Tollkeeper (Bloodlust, Fighter Talent: Weapon Bond; light weapon). Some taunting ensues between Ursa and the Tollkeeper before everyone piles into the tight arena. This works more in favour of Luna and her Raven than the Tollkeeper who is soon beaten down - killing blow to Ursa I believe. As far as I remember, neither Luna nor her Raven missed a strike during the entire session (three fights in tight arenas). After a brief rest (Heartsong) the pair continue and soon find the Red Hunter - left badly wounded by the fleeing stragglers - heal him and move on. <br/><br/>The encounter is an ambush by two groups of three archers in tight arenas overlooking a path on the steep hillside. Luna's +3 Alertness detects the ambush before it's sprung. This combat took place in four arenas. The two ambushing arenas (above) were each connected to a Hazardous area of steep hillside which required a Daring roll to successfully move into. The PCs started in a neutral area of path which was connected to the two ambushing arenas by Ranged only connections. The Raven and the Bird Feeted Longrunner weren't effected by the terrain. The mook archers shot Luna a couple of times, once in the face, before being defeated.<br/><br/>Soon after the mountainside became steeper until they came into sight of a towering waterfall, behind which the path crossed. Before they could reach it, another split level mountainside encounter ensnared them. A half-woman, half-Komodo Dragon (centaur-style) (+4 Size, +3 Eloquence, Vicious, Siren (modified so that it actually ensorcelled them), Thick Skin) began to lure them up the cliff (two Daring rolls to climb up, a failure resulted in a one damage fall) then attempt to Push them down (for another one damage fall. Unfortunately for her, the PCs made their Daring rolls faster than she could push them off (which was only once out of about five attempts - too many high size PCs for that trick!). Ursa Major arrived at the top, pounded on his chest and ripped out his hair for a couple of rounds, building up 5 Awesome Tokens, (The Siren-creature attempted to push him off at this point, but failed) then pounded her for her last four HP.<br/><br/>The group continued to the waterfall, behind which lay, dum dum DUM, a cave! Who knew?<br/><br/>(The XP haul put all three characters around the 170 mark)<br/><br/>Lessons:<br/>Light weapons in tight arenas are deadly.<br/>Heartsong effectively means the PCs start every fight on full HP.<br/>Bird Feet poses a encounter design challenge for the GM.<br/>Outnumbering is deadly.<br/>A challenging fight requires mooks <i>and</i> a monster.<br/><br/>Questions:<br/>Are Companions supposed to be assigned a weapon?<br/><br/>Stay tuned next week as we delve into the dungeoneering capabilities of Red Box Hack!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124479/#Comment_124479" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T02:29:35+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  2:29AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds great, Hamish.
