We discovered that Jimmy and his second-in-command both loved the same woman, but she was killed by the second when she spurned him; it was also the second who was duelling the lieutenant. We travelled into the future and saw the child the woman had by Jimmy as a young man in a Christian orphange, flagellating the potential sin out of other orphans.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules as stated said that the investigation phase ended and the court phase began when wither player had obtained at least 5 coins; unfortunately, this meant we went into the court phase with the forces of hell having 6 coins in their possession, while heaven only had 2, making the outcome of the court case a bit of a foregone conclusion; the redrafted rules now say that the phase change occurs only when both sides have at least 5 coins.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, Jimmy ended up in Hell, quite predictably, but the game was very enjoyable and created a rich and complex narrative as we wove together the threads of Jimmy's past and future to create an emergent story, so that now forms an important part of the redrafted game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
