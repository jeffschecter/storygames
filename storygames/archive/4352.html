Wouldn't it be nice, I said, if we could use the rules to draw attention to stuff that isn't a conflict?<br/>\n<br/>\nI stand by that, but hey ... people wanted <i>specifics</i>.  And, really, specifics are ... specific.  They'd be tangential.  But they're also fun, so I figured a new thread would be good.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here's me going off the deep end here:  Let's go beyond landmarking stuff that's merely <i>not a conflict</i>.  Let's talk about rewarding people for stuff in the story which <i>is not an action</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I'm very fond of "Get two widgets and a foober if you betray your group to their death" and similar stuff.  I think that it drives ... well ... action.  But there's stuff you can do other than action.  Sometimes the best landmark you can aim for it "Your character is sitting perfectly still, looking out a window as the rain falls."<br/>\n<br/>\nSetting aside <i>which formulae</i> need that kind of stuff (hint ... there's more than one) I'd like to wrestle with the difficulty of providing it.  Do you get a widget when you <i>first</i> look out the window?  What if we enter the scene <i>in media res</i>, with you already looking out the window?  What if you look out the window for a long time ... do you get more widgets?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above ridiculous questions are aimed to make something clear:  Rewarding someone with an instantaneous "This happens" sort of reward is in the wrong category if the thing you're trying to reward is not instantaneous, but rather continuous.  It's like trying to give your child a dollar every time they're blonde.  Either you never give them a dollar at all, or you give them an infinite amount of money.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what sort of mechanical rewards <i>would</i> make sense for passive, inactive conditions?  Passive, inactive rewards.  Check out this example:  "If your character feels all alone in the world then you may spend a widget point to flip up to three foobers.  If they don't feel all alone in the world then you may not."<br/>\n<br/>\nWould this type of setup encourage people to have <i>whole scenes</i> in which nothing actually happened, just to establish a state that's advantageous?  I tend to think that it would.  And, since I've got formulae that require such scenes, I think that's a damn fine thing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98176/#Comment_98176" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T11:58:10+00:00" title="September 21, 2007 11:58AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This might be absolutely not-what-you're-looking-for, as it's not so much about inaction.

I think I may have an idea of why this would be good, but I'm not sure if we're thinking along the same lines.

I mean, I do try and frequently succeed, but very often it falls by the wayside.. So the downtime is advantageous there. What I'm not sure of is how this concept translates into tabletop..

It seem to me that this is a circuitous observation that the assumptions in many games limit themselves to more extroverted, crudely drawn ways to address the plot. <br/><br/>Like an earlier thread about tracking symbolism and foreshadowing and encouraging them, just adding a structure were players beg for benefits by invoking things tends to be lame. There is no risk and the narrative weight assigned to it consists entirely of the player being pretentious (literally, exactly so, because you're busy reporting your Important Feelings).

"Sure, sure, you can build model airplanes with balsa wood - but I just <i>want</i> to use lead, okay?"

Like "smile" or "speak."  How about "As long as your character has nothing he cares about at stake, he cannot be killed, even in ambush.  If something he cares about is threatened then he can be harmed like any other character."<br/><br/>In fact, I can think of Kurosawa characters that this describes to a T.  When, for the first time in the movie, they start bleeding you think to yourself "Yeah ... that's because he let the plight of the villagers get to him.  Poor sap.  He's a goner now."<br/><br/>An actual play example:  I ran a My Life with Master where Eric's minion had the ability "Can escape any situation <i>unless</i> he would leave something he cares about behind."  He spent a lot of time dealing with another PC, talking and cooperating and generally bonding.  At one point late in the game the master attacked both of them, pinning the other PC.  Eric looked over the situation, and then said "I use my ability and escape."  And everybody said "Oh MAN!  That is ... oh that's harsh."  It wasn't the act of escaping that was harsh (though ... yeah, that too) but rather that the fact he could do it showed that his <i>state</i> was "not caring a whit about you."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98459/#Comment_98459" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T16:31:56+00:00" title="September 23, 2007  4:31PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>\n  Tony, I am going to admit I have no idea what you are talking about.<br/>\n  I mean, I understand the words, but what you are trying to say is a mystery.<br/>\n  The SOY example given by Lord Minx earlier, do you feel it applies to what you are trying to say?<br/>\n  What is the goal of a mechanic like this? Are we trying to raise dramatic tension by delaying the ultimate conflict? Are you trying to reward exposition, so we get to know th characters?

To me its significant what kind of bonus you are giving for inaction. For instance, Getting a scene framing/other dramatic-centered bonus for exposition-style scenes makes sense. Or giving someone a combat bonus for some sort of meditation, OK, I can see that. Or locking abilities behind emotions that the char must experience, that makes sense too.

Real lonbeliness isn't. Real moral positions are often reflexive. Game mechanics that deal with morality are not. For instance, Vampire's Humanity system is actually a check to determine the existence of moral conflict in-world (if you fail, you don't care and there's no conflict), but the game mechanic ensures that it is a type of conflict in the game's narrative, no matter (and preceding the) result.<br/><br/>"Begging," in the form of tagging, spending, using or performing any other almost-totally player-controlled action does not work well for these subtle narrative conflicts because the player simply asserts privilege regardless of the quality of performance. If I say I'm lonely IC and nobody else gives a shit, the loneliness mechanic was a stupid waste of time for the group. This is why appealing to the group as an audience, and basing a mechanic off of their feedback rather than individual player privilege, is in my mind a superior way to go about this.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if you don't like this because I didn't give you a fucking hug, Tony.

Ars Magica and Houses of the Blooded both have the latter, expressed over a seasonal scale; this could easily be used as the model for shorter periods of "downtime." But "downtime" . . . isn't.

The purpose of the mechanic isn't to restrict the rewards to the people to deliver quality portrayals of loneliness.  The purpose is to help draw the player's attention to that loneliness in their character, where otherwise they might have overlooked it.<br/><br/>I've heard the same groundless worry about TSoY Keys ... "Oh, you can't let somebody claim 2XP whenever they<i>say</i>that they've been influenced by the presence of their beloved ... they'll just take the points whether they've earned them or not."  And yet, somehow, Keys work just fine.<br/><br/>1) How does it draw attention to loneliness? Is there a loneliness template the player plus the character into? In that case, it's not loneliness in any narrative sense; it's a mechanical transaction where "loneliness" is about as meaningful as fire/acid/divine/epic templating in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>If loneliness is not templated and the mechanic can be used for any emotional state then it doesn't encourage the player to explore anything in particular. Well, maybe it asks him/her to toss some superficial content out there that means nothing to anybody except to get a bennie. Which is kind of underwhelming in terms of story.<br/><br/>2) TSoY's Key scenes do rely on audience approval since the Story Guide metes out the award. Plus of course, listed Keys themselves describe interpersonal conditions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98506/#Comment_98506" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T22:25:48+00:00" title="September 23, 2007 10:25PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>\n  Nah, not trying to get you worked up.

It's a subtle display of emotion/character. It's an ambiguous display (is it loneliness? Apprehension? Self-reflection? Detachment? etc.), but I would *expect* that the player was trying to trying to communicate <i>something</i>, even if it was just color.<br/><br/>So I would encourage people to dig a bit deeper and think about what the purpose of such "inaction" is really all about.

How about this ... whatever caring is (action or state or plasma or gefilte fish) it is <i>continuous</i> rather than instantaneous.  It does not occur at one particular moment in time, but rather is the case over a long span and without any initiation or execution during that period of time.<br/><br/>Like, "dying your hair blonde" is something which you start, you do, and it's done.  "Being blonde" is something which is the case over a long span, whether you're <i>doing it</i> or not.<br/><br/>EDIT to add this line:  Caring is something which is the case over a long span, whether you're doing anything specific about it or not.  Not caring is also something which is the case over a long span, whether you're doing anything specific about it or not.  I don't see them as being opposite on the spectrum I've been talking about.<br/><br/>Which is a long-winded way of saying "I don't see any distinction between your two examples.

My point is that there's no distinction between "rewarding long-term inaction" and "punishing short-term action" - they just depend on how you phrase the rule, positively or negatively. And it's often much easier to apply a "trigger" rule - "ah, now you're taking action X, so rule Y comes into effect". So a rule to encourage, for example, a lot of "feeling alone in the world" could be "for each relationship your character establishes, lose 1 Foobar Point".<br/><br/>But, of course, when - as you write - "not caring" and "caring" both are long-span things, negative rephrasing doesn't help much.<br/><br/>I'm getting lost, though.

Could be more, could be less, I like five.  On the track, one box will be marked as the current position.  Each end will be tied to an emotion.  Any time your character feels one of these emotions, you may move the current position on the track any number of spaces toward that emotion.  When your track is on one side of the middle, each box toward a particular emotion and away from the middle provides an incremental bonus to a related skill or roll or whatever.  It also gives you a penalty to the roll related to the opposite end of the track.  In the middle, you get no bonuses or penalties to either roll.<br/><br/>It might look like this:<br/><br/>Lonely [ ][X][ ][ ][ ] Outgoing<br/><br/>For the purpose of the example, we'll say that when you're lonely, you get a bonus to mental rolls, since you have more time to think.  When you feel outgoing, you get a bonus to social rolls.  In this case, the character in question would get a +1 to mental rolls, and a -1 to social rolls.  If the track were marked like this<br/><br/>Lonely [ ][ ][ ][ ][X] Outgoing<br/><br/>that would indicate a +2 to social rolls and a -2 to mental rolls.<br/><br/>Of course, without some further restriction on when you can change your current position, this would allow players to choose whatever bonus they wanted based on the situation at hand.  Perhaps an appropriate restriction would be that any time you narrate a demonstration of this emotion, you can change the position.  I think this could be pretty cool if the players were allowed to select or create these tracks for their character, somewhat like Keys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98954/#Comment_98954" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T11:00:40+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 11:00AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite>Perhaps an appropriate restriction would be that any time you narrate a demonstration of this emotion, you can change the position.</blockquote>That's a crucially different incentive though, yes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98991/#Comment_98991" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T12:18:28+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 12:18PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2007 12:18PM by Max Higley.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>That's a crucially different incentive though, yes?</blockquote>\nMaybe.  Requiring a demonstration of the emotion would seem to necessitate action, but not necessarily.  Sitting and staring out the window is an appropriate demonstration of some emotions, so a scene in which nothing else happened would still qualify with this restriction.  A demonstration of anger may be much more active.  This approach seems sort of action-agnostic, which may not be what you're looking for.<br/><br/>I'm struggling with how one can reward an internal state that is unobservable to the rest of the group without the "constant piling on of rewards" effect.  The track idea comes from your idea of having something you can fiddle with as long as some condition is true.

As long as there's not some arbitrageur-style loop which lets you end up with more of that resource than you started with, there's only a finite amount of good that people can get out of the reward, no matter how often they apply it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, if there is such a loop ("Convert one widget to three fleeples if you're lonely," "Convert two fleeples to a widget if you're angry,") then you're pretty well screwed.

The track thingy limits the total amount of reward you can have at any one time, and thus avoids this loop.\n<blockquote>You look at your track thing and say "Man, if the thing isn't attached to some measurable action then they'll have access to every reward at all times, and we can't have that!" and so you attach a measurable action.

How about scene boundaries?  At the end of any scene you participate in, if your character feels one of these things, you can move the track one way or another.

Because what you're rewarding there is not a state ... you are rewarding ending the scene.  You're tying the reward to a distinct <i>action</i>, in order to try to pin down the borders of the continuous state that you really want to be rewarding.<br/>\n<br/>\nPick a mechanic of some sort that can be applied an infinite number of times without upsetting the game, and all these problems disappear.  You can let people do it whenever they're in the state, as many times as they want, and everything's fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example:  Say you earn Widget points through some <i>action</i>.  Like, say, conflicts.  Earning them, clearly ... not something you can let the players apply an infinite number of times without upsetting the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut given that Widget points are limited, you can probably give the players unlimited ability to convert Widgets to Fleebles, right?  They'll stop when they run out of Widgets.  It's self-limiting, which means you don't need to put additional limits on it, which means that you can assign it to a continuous variable like "If you're sad" rather than an instant one like "Once each time you end a scene in which you feel sad" or anything like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99189/#Comment_99189" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T07:53:05+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  7:53AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2007 7:53AM by Max Higley.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, I get the concept, and I'm very cognizant of the failings of the mechanic I'm proposing.

In fact, I'm starting to see that players will be tempted to just say "I feel sad" in order to be able to convert things whenever they like without actually adding any content to the game at all.  So, remind me what the goal is here?  If we're trying to establish a landmark, is that landmark for one player or for the whole group?

So, I'm fine with that, and that's where I'm inclined to leave things between the two of us on this topic.  'kay?<br/>I can accept that, but I'm somewhat disappointed.  This feels like fertile ground to me, and I'm interested in planting something in it.  However, I'm experiencing difficulty understanding why you want to take it the direction you want to take it.  I perceive that direction as being away from a host of useful and interesting techniques that are close to what you're talking about, but not exactly in the tiny space you're delineating.  And I perceive that space as defined as leading to few productive techniques, because the space itself denies the existence of techniques themselves by proscribing action.  So, if this means I need to explore the "closely related but not precisely the same" territory with others here or on my own, then that's what I'll do.

I've actually got something like this working in my game Gnostigmata (free for download at http://legendaryquest.com).  The mechanics for what I'm talking about, though, feed directly into conflict resolution, so maybe it isn't what you're looking for.  In any case, it might spur some ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nGnostigmata is a game about the nature of reality.  Specifically, it deals with the conflict between the belief systems of Catholicism and Gnosticism.  It is GM-less, so the players control everything.  It is also competitive, so the players are always in conflict.  Each player has one attribute called "Coincidence" (or "Divine Grace" or "Fate" - depending on the character's perspective), which applies to all situations in scenes where a player's character is absent.  The combination of Fate and the fact that attacks can be either physical or intellectual sometimes produce circumstances where a character is essentially emotionally attacked by happenstance.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, suppose it has been established that a character, let's call him "Stan", used to have a daughter, but that daughter accidentally killed herself when playing with Stan's gun.  Further, suppose another player decides to use his "Coincidence" to perform an intellectual attack on Stan, who is currently in his apartment.  One possibility would be for the vibration of a passing train to cause one of his daughter's red rubber balls to fall off of the closet shelf and, further, the closet door just happens to be open.  The ball bounces a few times and then rolls to stop at Stan's feet.  The dice are rolled, Stan loses, and consequently suffers Agony at the reminder.  No characters, including Stan, did anything.  Further, nothing physically threatened Stan.  And yet, Stan suffers.  Stan's player would, of course, be allowed to narrate Stan's reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that kind of what you're looking for?  Gnostigmata is still in Beta, and doesn't quite meet my ultimate vision yet.  But, this part occasionally provides some nice effects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101467/#Comment_101467" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T22:02:13+00:00" title="October  6, 2007 10:02PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2007 10:07PM by dyjoots.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone looked at personal sets in Primetime Adventures for this sort of thing?
