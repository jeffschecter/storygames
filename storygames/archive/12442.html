A group of strangers wake up in a derelict, sealed house containing a large metal cylinder with a digital clock counting down from 2 hours and two boxes on opposite sides of it with a key hole in each one. A recorded message tells them that when the clock reaches zero, a toxic gas will be released, unless they can find two keys to disable the clock before then, The keys must be turned silmultaneously, but one of the locks is boobytrapped and will kill whoever turns the key in it.<br/><br/>Each player then describes what their character looks like but makes no choices about who they are, their background or their relationship to anyone else; each player has two revelation tokens with which to flesh out the story. A revelation token is spent to recognise another character in some way, to confide something about your own characters or to find a puzzle trap that contains a key; a revelation token is earned when a player tries to overcome a puzzle trap. We had an interesting start, with three of the characters being described largely by their physical appearance (large and muscular, tall and thin, etc) but the other two were wearing a diving suit and a pirate's costume!<br/><br/>Interestingly, though plenty of recognitions occurred, which gives the target character the option of either accepting that statement and gaining a skill or denying it and turning the accusation about to give the character who recognised them a skill, no-one ever chose to confide in another character, despite the fact that it operates in almost the same way. I wonder if that was just a result of our play-style or a lack of impetus to trust another character? Perhaps some increased incentive to confide in others would help...<br/><br/>The mecanics of the game depend on rolling dice to match the result on a neutral die; succeed and you get a key! If you have a skill that relates to the puzzle, you doubled the dice rolled and you could also permanently increase your stats by making accusations or confiding in others. The catch is that a double on any roll puts you in Pain, which kills you the next time you fail a puzzle, but a triple kills you outright.<br/><br/>The game played very fast, taking 5 of us to go from start to finish in less than an hour, but it didn't leave much room for character interaction beyond making accusations against each other and then squabbling over who should have the keys we'd found. I believe in the maxim 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it', and the game ceratinly worked, but it seemed a little dry and might benefit from a flashback/cutaway mechanic that would allow players to portray scenes outside the immedaite location of their imprisonment.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279490/#Comment_279490" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-06T17:16:18+00:00" title="July  6, 2010  5:16PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you have a link to the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279521/#Comment_279521" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-07T00:50:12+00:00" title="July  7, 2010 12:50AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I have a sheet of A4 paper with the rules for the game written in longhand, with plenty of bits crossed out and rewritten; I may have to place it on Google docs, when I get time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333706/#Comment_333706" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-09T19:32:07+00:00" title="July  9, 2011  7:32PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi James<br/><br/>Sitting here reading the submittal to PDM and this thread helped to clear up one or two points. So when players cross of a skill can they not use it again, as in the Carny example,can he not use it in another puzzle or not?<br/><br/>Also if there is a usable skill why have more puzzle dice rolled vice adding to the characters die roll? So best case, in those instances, I as a PC can roll 3 dice (either selfish or selfless) and then there are 2 puzzle dice to try and match up. I would rather I add a dice to my rolls, making it 4 dice for me to try and match up to the single puzzle dice. How has this played out so far?<br/><br/>Also there seems to be no real mechanical issue with a Pain Dice or two. Heck that could make it easier to get a Key if I have some more dice, however increasing the chance of triples and instant death. But otherwise, unlike in DRYH, having more Pain is not too bad on the face of it.<br/><br/>Otherwise a fine addition and it is going to be in PDM 9 coming out soon....<br/><br/>Tad                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333718/#Comment_333718" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-10T00:16:31+00:00" title="July 10, 2011 12:16AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2011 12:20AM by James_Mullen.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent, that is good news. Obviously, for interested onlookers, the game has evolved since that intitial paper scrawl and the latest version was playtested at Indiecon 2010, as well as featuring at the London Indie Meetup when I wasn''t there, so it passes the 'other people can run the game' test! :-D<br/>\n<br/>\nTo deal with your questions:<br/>\n- Yes, each skill can only be used once; after a skill has been used in an attempt at a puzzle, the skill is crossed off, whether the attempt was successful or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The skill bonus has worked well so far: don't forget that adding anything to the number of dice you roll makes it more likely that your character will die! The puzzle die bonus obtained from using a skill is therefore 'safe'.<br/>\n<br/>\n- After trying other iterations of the rules, the 'roll triple and die' turned out to be the most effective: in other versions, death was either too frequent or too rare. So, inevitably, the first pain die you collect carries with it a very low risk of death, but don't forget that spending a pain die is also a requirement of confiding in another character, which is the only way to get more revelation tokens into circulation, so there is a small incentive for players to gain pain as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333997/#Comment_333997" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-12T09:27:04+00:00" title="July 12, 2011  9:27AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks James.
