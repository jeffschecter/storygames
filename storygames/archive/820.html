                    Last saturday in my improv class we played a game that I really want to repurpose as an RPG mechanic.  Here's the setup:<br/><br/>We're working on relationships in class.  The exercise is intended to force us to establish very solid, complex relationships with a partner.  We start on either side of the stage and begin a scene, but movement is linear and unidirectional - our goal is to meet center stage, and we're only allowed to take a step when we've added detail to our relationship.  The instructor says "take a step" when he's satisfied with a statement we've made.  So:<br/><br/>***<br/>PARTNER ONE:  I didn't even know 'crashing a yacht' was possible, Maurice.<br/><br/>INSTRUCTOR:  Take a step.<br/><br/>PARTNER TWO:  I've ... always been clumsy.  It's my curse.<br/><br/>INSTRUCTOR:  Take a step.<br/><br/>PARTNER ONE:  And yet, somehow, I still love you.<br/><br/>INSTRUCTOR:  Take a step.<br/><br/>PARTNER TWO:  I can't seem to avoid screwing up.<br/><br/>(Stony silence from INSTRUCTOR.  Not good enough)<br/><br/>For a Nazi you're very gracious, Emily, and very forgiving.<br/><br/>INSTRUCTOR:  Take a step!<br/>***<br/><br/>A silly example, but invariably we'd meet at the middle with very rich characters brimming with options after five or six declarative statements by each player, building on what had already been said.  I love this idea for establishing relationships among characters in-game, but can't imagine the "instructor approval" model of validation being useful.  Let's talk about ways to implement this either mechanically or within some clearly-defined social contract parameters.                </div>

                            I'd argue that a play group has that responsibility anyway.  I'm looking for an interesting way to encourage and reinforce this, as in "we hand you dice to use in conflicts between these two characters based on the complexity of your relationship, as indicated by your statements."  And I don't want a central authority making value judgments.  Does that make what I'm after any clearer?  It's a bit of a fishing expedition I'll admit.                        </div>

                            How about a Fan-Mail type system?<br/>
<br/>
Whenever a player narrates a detail of his characters relationship with another, anybody else can give the narrating player a token*. These tokens can be used later by that player to modify conflicts with the other character or similar.<br/>
<br/>
Authority over what's good enough and isn't should then become distributed amongst the group.<br/>
<br/>
*EDIT: I'm not sure how new tokens would enter the economy, but it would have to be a controlled resource in the same way that Budget gets turned into the Audience pool in PTA.                        </div>

                            Jason, some groups just can't handle that.  You're probably better off (as little-w warren suggests) having participants reward good contributions in some way that helps players reach their goals.<br/>
<br/>
There is a pitfall with this, however in that the reward can become de rigeur and cheapened if rigor is not applied, or else it can become forgotten if it's applied too rarely.                        </div>

                            What about requiring the player towards which the connection is directed to respond to the connection?  What about requiring an exchange--i.e. no one gets anything until player one reaches out, player two responds, player one responds, and player two responds.  That way you get the "we meet in the middle" moment rather than just "ooh, I like that connection."<br/>
<br/>
As for judging, perhaps a rule like this: "Repetition cannot occur in an exchange--each response must add substantively to the previous."  If it merely rephrases a previous response, the 'judges' get to withold rewards for the whole exchange.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm clumsy, it's my curse" is very, very similar to "I'm always screwing up" but "I feel I always owe you something because you still love me when I screw up" repeats *with* development--i.e. takes the love, takes the screwing up, and establishes a new attitude based on their copresence (I owe you...).<br/>
<br/>
Could that additive structure be coded to the rules with other players being the judge?  It gives them a pretty straightforward rubric to work with and it would allow the nazi move, as well--it takes her forgiveness and reframes it, extracting an implicit sadism (*somehow* I still love you) into an explicit one (for a nazi).<br/>
<br/>
Rule: If everyone at the table affirms exchange, each player gets rewarded.  If only some affirm, allow majority to carry the decision?  If the exchange is affirmed, then it gets 'scripted' into the story.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I like about this mechanic--it has a very pull quality, since the other person can always 'drop' the ball and keep the exchange from becoming part of the story.                        </div>

<br/>
Are you looking to create a character creation style mechanism where these steps would take place before other story narrations, or are you just looking for any mechanism which, inspired by the improv game, would ultimately lead to the relationship between two characters being ultimately drawn very tight?<br/>

                            Jason, it sounds like you want something similar to Breaking The Ice. <br/>
<br/>
In that game, someone gives you a dice every time you do something they find attractive. Just expand that so other players give you dice for narrating cool relationship things (and withhold dice until you've done so).<br/>

                            Actually, in the back of my head I'm thinking about this as a character generation procedure.  Say you have an ensemble cast consisting of names and needs ("Mr. Greenglass; Love")   A player chooses Mr. Greenglass and ties him to every other PC using this "take a step" method.  Once a "step" is approved (however that happens), the facts revealed become canonical.  This approval could be as simple as your partner agreeing to it BtI style, or as complicated as a PTA-like currency mechanic.                        </div>

<p>Is there any reason why a simple "Yes, and..." system wouldn't get at what you're looking for?  Wouldn't it work just as well if there were no formal approval system at all?  Just a little guideline is all I imagine it would need.</p>

Imagine character generation in Dogs like this: the other players keep your dice. You suggest a relationship. If the other players like the relationship, they give you dice for it; otherwise, they withhold the dice until you say something good.<br/>
