(Each site nominally holds eight campers, and depending of the tent configuration could certainly hold more.<br/><br/>We were up on a hill last time, but there wasn't much wind. The campground is actually across the road from the water, but you could certainly walk to the beach.<br/><br/>Nighttime got a bit cold, but this year we're slightly later so it should be warmer.<br/><br/>We had a few gas stoves last time, but we also had a wood fire.<br/><br/>Cambria is a mile down the road, complete with grocery store.<br/><br/>We didn't interact much with non-Nerdly campers, as the part wasn't even close to full so people tended to spread out. Everyone I dealt with was nice though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Faerieloch" title="Faerieloch"><img alt="Faerieloch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Faerieloch">Faerieloch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136927/#Comment_136927" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-29T20:43:38+00:00" title="March 29, 2008  8:43PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are also flush toilets and a couple of sinks to wash dishes at the campground, as well as a place to buy firewood if you run out.  It was a chilly at night and there was a bit of fog in the morning, but t-shirt warm during the day.  Bring a sun-hat.  Each campsite has a firepit with grill that worked well for cooking meats/veggies for dinner, and there were a couple of propane-fueled campstoves for other cooking, too.  There are some trees and the campsites were relatively flat; definitely enough space so no one had to sleep on a noticeable slope.<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136934/#Comment_136934" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-29T23:59:34+00:00" title="March 29, 2008 11:59PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And, yes, showers.<br/><br/>I really, really like this park.  It's well-put-together, in a beautiful location, and relatively unknown, so uncrowded.<br/><br/>Last year we did a slightly overcomplicated food plan; this year we're simplifying and making things more sit-chat-and-be-friendly rather than hey-everybody-it's-time-to-help-make-food.  We'll have propane and firepits for cooking this year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
