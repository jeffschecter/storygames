Ask the players what their characters are thinking, then use it against them (but warn them first).<br/><br/>- Don't know what to do? Ask the players what their characters wish would happen.<br/><br/>- Have 2 GMs on the opposite extreme sides of the room rotating between describing foreground and background details in the world.<br/><br/>- Use cues to signal scene transitions. Changing music. Turning lights on and off. Asking players to close their eyes. Changing where the players sit.<br/><br/>- When choosing characters, players only have access to the characters picture and name. They then each get to ask 2 questions about the characters to help them decide who they want to play. GMs note the questions as they reveal what players are interested in.<br/><br/>- To create insane background sounds of confusion, open up 10 random YouTube videos in separate tabs and have them all play at the same time.<br/><br/>- Have the GMs pace around the room in circles, pausing randomly, and then changing directions to create confusion.<br/><br/>- Use countdowns. You have 30 seconds to... 3 seconds...<br/><br/>- Text message awful thoughts in the form of words and pictures to illustrate what players see when no one else is looking.<br/><br/>- Leaving the room for 2, 5, 15, 20+ minutes at a time.<br/><br/>- Relay rules information in character. In scary monster voice, "I'm going to destroy everyone you care about, starting with... by the way you can roll to stop me... with Bob because I know you care about him least but it will make it clear what I will do to the people you actually care about... please note your injuries... rahhhhrrr."<br/><br/>- When trying to decide what other characters will suffer for the PC's failure, we asked the player to announce who their character cared the most and least about. We asked them to be truthful while making it clear their answers will be used against them. But be truthful. <br/><br/>- Trick players into framing scenes (co-GMing) in character. One of the game's mechanics was you chose a picture from a yearbook and tell us what regret on your character sheet it reminded you of and why. We then played out that scene using the described details.<br/><br/>- Use every day interfaces like Facebook profiles as character sheets.<br/><br/>- Opt out mechanics so that players can call for a break or opt out if anything was too much. X-Card: <a href="http://goo.gl/ztpWY" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/ztpWY</a><br/><br/>- Talk after the game to talk about what players liked, disliked, and how they felt. <br/><br/>- When uncomfortable, slow down, talk less, stare, linger in the moment. <br/><br/>- Time feels relative. I don't know what's too fast or too long. So I count to 30 or 60 in my head if I want to slow down.<br/><br/>- Encourage pregnant pauses. To prime this I used a lot of expressions and cliches but didn't finish them. "you just flushed it all down the..." ::walk away:: <br/><br/>- Reincorporated all mistakes of unshared imagination. If you thought you hear two different things because of a player (not character) mistake... It wasn't a mistake. <br/><br/>- Believe what is happening in the fiction and share that belief with your eyes. <br/><br/><br/>Fun!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390454/#Comment_390454" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T14:08:27+00:00" title="September 16, 2012  2:08PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2012 2:09PM by John_Harper.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys are crazy wizards.

Second was a con room with nothing special. <br/><br/>Games were about 4 hours and 6 players each. <br/><br/>Lots of X-Card use by players on each other when they broke the tone in ridiculous ways (laughter is cool though). One almost X-Card use regarding a crashed plane and 9/11 triggers. When I say almost, I mean touching the card as a warning. <br/><br/>Players who didn't use the X-Card said that is still helped as it made them feel safer.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
