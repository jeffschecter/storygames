In the eyes of most, "magic" = "bad".  You play a regular nobody, who advances through play to become something more.<br/><br/>Reward Path 1:<br/>Go solve mysteries &amp; problems involving the supernatural.  Get clues in the process that gradually reveal how you could do some magics yourself.  Yay!  Learning rare, special knowledge is cool!  Now we can use it for... uh...<br/><br/>Reward Path 2:<br/>Go solve mysteries &amp; problems that beat back evil and benefit humanity.  The Empire rewards you with gear and authority, and you can eventually be granted land and lordship over an area.  Yay!  Becoming someone important is cool!<br/><br/>I want these to be one cycle that really feeds back into itself strongly on both a per-mission level and a large campaign level.  I think a good answer to the thread title, given the constraints of the Setting I described, oughta do it.<br/><br/>Brainstorms welcome.  Pointing out fatal flaws is welcome too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182968/#Comment_182968" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T20:07:13+00:00" title="December 11, 2008  8:07PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really get why learning magic wouldn't make you able to get gear, authority, land, etc. even without being granter such things by an empire. I mean, if this is like low level "flame finger and glowing ball of light" magic then yeah, it wouldn't help, but actually effective magic could be used to improve society and carve a niche for yourself with ease. Even if magic is viewed as bad by a society, doesn't mean that it can't be helpful.<br/><br/>As far as how it would make you matter, it could easily put you on the level of "invented electricity" and from there it's a short leap to "used superior firepower to overthrow an entire continent". Especially if only a few people had magic, it would definitely make you matter in my book, even if only for the novelty of being the only one able to re-arrange the building blocks of reality without also being made of pure evil. (Unless of course, magic in your setting turns you pure evil, but even then you could still matter a lot, just not in the friendly sort of way).<br/><br/>Hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182973/#Comment_182973" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T20:29:25+00:00" title="December 11, 2008  8:29PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to attack the question, but why do you want it to be one cycle?

I didn't want 3 PCs with 3 short, unrelated missions, based on backstory that hadn't seen play.  So I guided them to specify these goals:<br/><br/>Path of Renown: Become a feared chieftain<br/>Path of Power: Protect men from the Cursed<br/>Path of Power: Achieve social/political power/influence<br/><br/>The thing is, as GM, I haven't been able to do a very good job answering "how do tidbits of magic lore help you <i>progress toward</i> those goals?"<br/><br/>It's not hard to engineer a sequence of "solve mysteries, get magic info, eventually learn spells, then once you've learned spells <i>stop</i> solving mysteries and go forward with personal plans, abetted by magic."  It's the smaller-grain progress that I need a context to provide.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182989/#Comment_182989" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T22:32:47+00:00" title="December 11, 2008 10:32PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your question is formulated in a somewhat counter-intuitive manner that makes answering difficult.

It's certainly somewhat difficult for us to suggest things to David when on some very fundamental level the majority of us <i>likes</i> the idea that a character would need to choose between being a "warrior type" and being a "wizard type". I know that I do - making integrating the two identities difficult opens the doors for all sorts of cool conflicts between the two paradigms as personified by characters who choose to follow those paths. I'd be all for playing Siegfried from Soulcalibur in this setting and being all "Magic, bitches? I'll show you magic - the imperial kind! Catapults!"<br/><br/>But that's not what David's looking for, I understand. Rather, how would you integrate those two identities and reward cycles?<br/><br/>David: are you familiar with <i>Barbaren</i>? In that game all characters have these two resource cycles side by side, one for fighting, one for fucking. The way they integrate is that a successful fighter collects energy for horny exploits, while the successful lover gains energy for aggression. Thus characters have to alternate between these activities, there is no such thing as a fighting-specialized barbarian. Is this along the lines you're thinking here? Characters need the imperial mandate to preserve their social acceptance despite the magical experiments they make, and they need the magic to understand the enemy and thus prove themselves to the emperor? Doing service to the empire allows the character the social and financial freedom to explore magic, and doing magic allows the character to serve the empire - would that be the sort of integrated cycle you're thinking of here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182997/#Comment_182997" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T01:19:36+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  1:19AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, to make this more concrete: I understand that magic is low-powered in this setting, so "serving the empire with magic" above would obviously be things like seeking hidden lore and figuring out snippets of crucial info about the enemy. Sage stuff that leads to the wizard stuff later. The emperor covets this information, but it's basically only available for sages who delve into enemy lore - perhaps, if the enemy is sufficiently bad-ass, the only real way of gaining insight is to call up demons from the pit and interrogate them. Something like that - magic is not useful for throwing fireballs, but it is useful for the information war, which might be important when you don't know anything about the enemy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182998/#Comment_182998" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T01:33:57+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  1:33AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2008 1:34AM by David_Berg.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Barbaren-style is fine.

It's a selfish power (which is why everyone hates it), but it can solve those things that public power are no use for. It can make another man's true love sleep with you instead. It can make your hated rival have an accident. It can cure you of your recurring nightmares from the crimes you committed. <br/><br/>For parallel cycles you can just make sure that characters have goals that could only be answered by one sort of power or the other. For interwoven cycles make sure that character goals really need to be answered by both of them. A good way to do the later might be the Houses of the Blooded way, magic is totally forbidden to everyone ... but the more mundane power you have the more people will look the other way. This is especially good if dabbling in magic to solve your inner problems leaves some sort of external mark, stigmata or consequence that others could ignore if you are of sufficient rank.<br/><br/>For a more arthurian sort of bent you could imagine that the stigmata is something that happens to your land, like famine, plague, or best of all, occurrences of evil magic that you need to go and fight. Then all the reward systems are bound together in a rather dysfunctional relationship. Personal need drives you to learn magic, using magic creates external threats you need to fight, fighting them gains temporal power, gaining temporal power lets you get away with using more magic, using more magic creates more threats ... and so on <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183062/#Comment_183062" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T10:24:44+00:00" title="December 12, 2008 10:24AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>Putting it in terms of what character need is answered by doing it, maybe magic is the tool that answers the murky inner dilemmas, greed, jealousy, hatred, lust and the like.

Magic is serious stuff, and the general belief that it's always evil should remain at least eerily plausible.  As for "you can get away with it more if you wield more power", makes sense and sounds tense and fun.<br/><br/>I love the flavor of "magic accomplishes things that swords and political clout are no good for", but as for murky inner dilemmas, I don't tend to spend much play time on the PCs' personal lives.  Making your rival's wife sleep with you would be neat, but it wouldn't ever be a huge deal in itself... it'd need to tie back into the ascendance character track to <i>really</i> matter... like if it would make your rival challenge you to a duel, so you can kill him legally and take his land, or some such.<br/><br/>Hmm... maybe there are specific obstacles to ascendance that magic is uniquely suited to solving?  I'll see if I can think of some...  Obviously, possession and mind control always help, but I'd like it if something a little less bad-ass could help too.<br/><br/>Eero,<br/>The general equation of using your unique powers to accomplish impressive feats and thus win recognition, promotions, and unique assignments is solid.<br/><br/>I think it would be ideal, though, to provide alternatives, lest players feel like "I guess we do what the Empire tells us to" and lose their initiative.<br/><br/>"Scouts and spies in the info war" is a fantastic option to have, but I'm wary of making it the <i>only</i> option.<br/><br/>Using your unique powers to directly grab at what you want, instead of being handed what you want for doing other stuff, is an option I'd like to support somehow.<br/><br/>As for the true nature of magical secrets, your idea that they're intertwined with the working of the world accords perfectly wth my metaphysics.  However, you can only do The Big Reveal once, y'know?  <br/><br/>What I'm struggling to do is to get there in satisfying (but small) increments.<br/><br/>My current scheme of magical progression starts with purely observation powers, moves on to applying acquired data to specific items, and then eventually gets to the point where you could organize a ritual and try to create a given effect.  I'm open to tweaking the specifics, but that's an idea of the general power level.  So, it may be a while before PCs can scry or teleport or turn invisible, etc.  It would be really awesome if I could find a way to take a power like, "ah, when I see the sign of the Spider, it means the problem was caused by a wizard" or "don't touch that plant, I see an orange aura that indicates poison" and attach some social-climbing power to it.<br/><br/>Despite this long post of "buts", these ideas are really pushing in some fun directions.  Please, keep 'em comin'!<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183345/#Comment_183345" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-14T20:00:19+00:00" title="December 14, 2008  8:00PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way to do the Big Reveal more than once is to not do such. Rather, do small reveals, like so:\n<ul>\n<li>What do you know, people can use magic and still remain themselves. Who knew?</li>\n<li>Hey, that senator has a magical aura. How come?</li>\n<li>WTF, apparently there is some sort of freemason-like secret cabal out there that tries to monopolize magic-use and rule the empire from the shadows.</li>\n<li>Hey, cool, I joined them.</li>\n<li>Mindblowing! They're telling me that the emperor is actually a magical construct and not the son of god we were taught. Magic actually controls the empire.</li>\n<li>Damn, now this ecclesiastical secret society is telling me that my secret society is full of lies and the emperor is actually just a man. Luckily they want my magic for keeping the world together.</li>\n<li>etc... the truth might be out there, but it's not going to come in for a couple of seasons yet.</li>\n</ul>\nAnyway, the basic problem of how to make magic matter in social climbing seems obvious to me - magic is understanding of the nature of the world and it might allow you to sabotage enemy rituals as well as, ultimately, create your own. Of course it's going to give you a social cachet. Science did that as early as the Middle Ages, and science does not give you special sight for perceiving when somebody is using his amazing science powers. Even if we dropped all possible religious power, information power, influence over weak minds, martial enchantments and all other practical uses magic might conseivably have, it'd <i>still</i> be something rulers would want to possess and sponsor just for the prestige as long there was some vague promise of value in it. Just consider how much a medieval university costs, and then remember that the only practical reason for having such at the time was to get a place to school priests in - priests who in turn are largely useless. So if a medieval ruler will finance an university for priests, why not wizards?<br/><br/>How positioning in the power structure of the empire would feed your magic is somewhat less obvious, but only if you're stuck with D&amp;D-like utility magic. Start talking of rituals that require shaping cliff-faces into totemic shapes and the concentrated worship of hundreds of acolytes, and we're again in the area of public works projects that can only be attempted with the blessings and financing of the ruler. In an environment where magic is reliably teachable to anybody with sufficient leisure, but expensive to use, the only people who are magicians <i>will</i> be the rulers and their advisors. Others are limited to cheap hedge-workings and observing what the high and mighty attempt.<br/><br/>In other words, I sort of don't perhaps quite see how this would be difficult to achieve in play. Both magic and social position are clearly useful and preferable for ambitious characters, and they both allow for utility and threaten attacks on fronts that others are vulnerable to without their own resources. So it seems obvious to me that unless genre convention or specific rules limit it, of course power-seeking characters will find it immensely preferable to be both magicians and nobility, using the strengths of one to gain advantages in the other role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183447/#Comment_183447" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T11:23:49+00:00" title="December 15, 2008 11:23AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>Another thought:<br/><br/>A setup that generates opportunities for those who learn metaphysical secrets can easily be prepared.<br/><br/>Things like:<br/><br/>* The secrets you are discovering allow you to control a resource or find a way to prevent a problem.<br/><br/>For instance, the poisonous plants you mentioned with the yellow aura? If they are not identifiable in any other way, and their presence is devastating a whole agricultural society, whoever has the means to sniff those out can use that ability to advance themselves, make demands, etc.<br/><br/>* Enough in the world is based on magical secrets that learning any gives you leverage to move up in society<br/><br/>You'd have to keep the secrets pretty subtle to keep your "low magic" vibe, but otherwise it's solid. Make sure the characters are interested in achieving power upfront, then give them opportunities to discover secrets. If each secret gives them a way of understanding how someone who HAS power already can be manipulated, you're tying magical discovery to social advancement. For instance, if I learn that the General is only successful in battle because of a magical charm he keeps in his boot... and perhaps what kind of magic would counteract that charm, I have the means to become more powerful/influential/successful.<br/><br/>In other words, those who have power in your setting have achieved it through some magical means. They don't "play fair", which is why they are dominant. Learning their secrets, though, allows you to compete with them, blackmail them, and eventually take their place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183585/#Comment_183585" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T20:26:20+00:00" title="December 15, 2008  8:26PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2008 8:28PM by JuddG.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are cultures (mostly Eastern, as I recall) where only someone who rejects mortal, temporal power can have magic.

They would also wear clothing with some obvious flaw so that they were not valuable.  They acted in ways that caused men to distrust them and pity them - for a man who follows you or respects you is an asset you can ill afford.<br/><br/>Backing Paul's comments above up, what if the magical and the mortal realm were at odds specifically because the powers behind them were either unrelated and opposed, or (perhaps even better) interrelated and denied?  The very powers that send heroes out to destroy the magic in the shadows pray that those heroes never see what happens in their own cellars.

I'd like to give the poor guy (who is often me) some help, in terms of both inspiration/context and procedures/advice.  Thus, my solicitation in this thread for the more general answer.<br/><br/>I'm still hoping to engineer some schema that'll make dumping the right kinds of problems, secrets, and opportunities into play as easy as possible.  Something broad like "all powerful people have achieved their status via magic" -- just not that, specifically.  <br/><br/>I'd like to work in the nature of the world somehow, but the problem is that such info is free for distribution -- once <i>someone</i> knows that moonlight cures the plague, soon <i>everyone</i> knows it and it isn't a secret and society starts looking funny as folks utilize it.  I've also toyed with underground problem-sources, with PC powers uniquely suited to find the entrances, but I fear that'll get lame if it becomes predictable ("something's amiss? let's look for the tunnel entrance we know must be around somewhere").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184308/#Comment_184308" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T15:15:29+00:00" title="December 19, 2008  3:15PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>You're trying to create a game with a consistent "gameworld", right? And one that has to be "replayable"? In that case, you might have a serious problem. The discovery of major secrets is going to change stuff, probably too much for your liking, and, yeah, "everyone will find out". If you can't accept that kind of change, you might be stuck.<br/><br/>A model for creating such worlds and mysteries, which can then be uncovered, might be more doable. Then you can devise a procedure that does that consistently.<br/><br/>However, I think that's not what you want.<br/><br/>Do you want:<br/><br/>1. Players explore world with no creative input, discovering secrets everywhere they go.<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>2. The GM does NOT need to continually come up with "secrets that matter"?<br/><br/>That sounds, uh, tricky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184321/#Comment_184321" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T16:03:59+00:00" title="December 19, 2008  4:03PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>You're trying to create a game with a consistent "gameworld", right?</blockquote>\nWhat about a game that has a consistent starting point, but the secrets that are discovered alter it so that the end result is like an RPG version of the child's game "Rumor".  It would be kind of cool to have a talk about a game where you're discussing the game and find that each of you discovered very different truths about the same political entities and groups.<br/><br/>I think this idea has an appeal to my way of thinking.  Now, a twist I just thought of is - what if you could join another game in process at another group with the character who came from another game in progress.  Two worlds that started from a single starting point that went in differing directions and are now joined by some sort of probabilistic travel.<br/><br/>This needs to go to a new discussion...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184460/#Comment_184460" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T00:10:25+00:00" title="December 21, 2008 12:10AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2008 12:11AM by David_Berg.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>PC actions and discoveries deforming small parts of the world is fine.  "We discovered this city is growing on the back of a demon, which must be prevented from awakening at all costs!" kicks ass.  Any other city is still plausibly normal.  <br/><br/>"We discovered this whole world is growing on the back of a demon, which must be prevented from awakening at all costs!" deforms the setting too much.  Replayability is part of that, but the bigger part is losing the relationship between setting and characters that I like.  The world ceases to feel big and weighty and real and consequential and awesome if you can, like, save it single-handedly.  It's pretty much your bitch at that point.  And, y'know, there's still fun to be had in preventing people from stealing or roughing up your bitch, but that's really a different game.\n<blockquote>A model for creating such worlds and mysteries, which can then be uncovered, might be more doable.

Just replace "worlds" with "baronies" or "provinces" or "earldoms" or some such.\n<blockquote>Do you want:<br/>1. Players explore world with no creative input, discovering secrets everywhere they go.<br/>and<br/>2. The GM does NOT need to continually come up with "secrets that matter"?</blockquote>No, it <i>is</i> okay to force the GM to do that -- <i>just not without help</i>, in the form of inspiration, guidance, and tools.  That's really what I meant with the end of my last post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184464/#Comment_184464" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T00:55:38+00:00" title="December 21, 2008 12:55AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe magic lets you see and interact with the demons, daemons, spirits, and other supernatural entities roaming the world that no one else can?<br/><br/>Then the problem changes from "how is magic is cool/useful?" to "how can I make cool and interesting stories about supernatural entities and their motivations, and how the characters can impede or assist them?"  (It also gives you an easy explanation for why magic is frowned on, since, well, you'd look like a fucking lunatic if you told anyone that you saw a demon steering the local parson like a marionette with innumerable inky black tentacles of smoke, or had a charming afternoon tea with a blue-furred ocelot wearing a monocle, or whatever.)<br/><br/>Without magic, you can't address the roots of supernatural evil, because you can't see or touch it.  Without magic, you can't enlist supernatural allies of your own.  But without temporal power, you can't fight the evil done in real life, or enlist real-life allies.  Since you can't fight just one half of the evil and achieve any lasting success, you have to pursue both goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185065/#Comment_185065" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-27T17:39:46+00:00" title="December 27, 2008  5:39PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, well, we're very much on the same page about a cool experience of a secret magical reality.  My PCs already sense things that others can't.  I don't want to go down the track of supernatural entities' motivations, though.  They all have the same motivation: to annihilate physical reality and especially humanity.<br/><br/>Now, being able to look at a problem and say, "I am uniquely equipped to identify and combat this problem cuz I know some magic!" is great!  However, creating the right problems, and the right relationships to derive benefit from problem-solving, continues to be the tricky part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
