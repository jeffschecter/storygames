But then I realized what I want to say is because there's such a scatter shot.  What I want to do is narrow down exactly what the complaint is.  In particular I'd like to hear from Josh, Paul, Judson and Ryan since they kind of spearheaded this whole thing.  Here is the list of possible issues plus where I personally stand on them.<br/><br/><b>Half-Baked Games</b><br/><br/>This is the case where the game has not been thoroughly play tested and clearly has procedural flaws relative to the experience it's trying to deliver.  One simple factor I've seen many games over look is how to handle ties in the resolution system.  A lot of games don't consider certain boundary conditions in the resolution system.  Some don't really explain how to handle a certain kind of conflict very well (PvP or Multi-way Conflict).  Or maybe the system has an optimal strategy such as highly rewarding one kind of behavior even though the game suggests you should want to do one or two others.<br/><br/>My Take: Yes this is a real issue.  My Pet Peeve: PLEASE, PLEASE study the issue of Orthogonal vs. Oppositional conflict.<br/><br/>Solution: More play-testing and especially more play-testing in the absence of the designer.<br/><br/><b>Games That Take Practice</b><br/>See my thread with this title for a more thorough examination of this topic.  In summary there are games whose procedures are actually complete and functional but require a high degree of artistry from the players to get the desired results.  The musical instrument analogy applies in full.  You can have the most precision tuned instruments in the world but they aren't going to make music for you.<br/><br/>My Take: I like these games.  I know others don't.  Judson once said to me, "I feel like some games do nothing other than give me permission to tell a story."  I think he may have been talking about this kind of game.  I, on the other hand, have no problem telling someone who has failed with these games, "You played it wrong."  The real issue with this category is play testing.  These games are vulnerable to social and creative differences among a widely disparate number of people.  So when one group fails in play testing and comes back with a list of issues how do you weed out the legitimate issues from the issues that arose because they didn't bring the level of artistry to the table that the game requires.  I keep trying to start discussions on this issue and they keep getting derailed.<br/><br/>The Solution: I honestly don't know.  I'd like to talk about it in another thread.<br/><br/>(more)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129314/#Comment_129314" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T14:00:29+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  2:00PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2008 2:11PM by Jesse.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Designer Not Included</b><br/>The previous two problems have been referring to game designs directly.  This is the first issue that gets into the text of games and is some what related to the games that take practice issue.  Sometimes a game and its textual presentation are procedurally complete but what they fail to mention are certain social expectations on how those procedures are meant to be applied in order to work as advertised.  Both Capes and The Shab-al-Hiri Roach are guilty of this.  Both fail to mention something that I consider to be fundamentally required to make the game work - It is not enough to pursue your character's goals.  These two games only sing when your character's goals threaten the interests of another player.  See the Handbook part of Dirty Secrets and the discussion of The Cold in Spione on how to avoid this problem.  See my thread on the The Forge titled The Social Mandate.<br/><br/>My Take: Sometimes this is an issue and sometimes it isn't.  Some games just have a very specific target audience and the game simply will not function if you are not part of that target audience.  I agree that it would be nice if the text told you up front who it was written for but I'm also not afraid of putting a little responsibility on the reader to decide if this is something they really want to put time and effort into.  A big BIG example of this is probably Lacuna.  For what it's worth, Sorcerer &amp; Sword was like that for me.  I knew NOTHING about the genre when I bought Sorcerer and its supplements.  But after reading my attention was peaked and I said, "I think this is something I want to learn" and have literally spent years both studying the source material and the game.  I think the books give you enough of a taste to decide if it's something you want to pursue or not.<br/><br/>The Solution: This problem is hard to diagnose because the designer probably already brings to the table The Social Mandate unconsciously.  I have watched many Capes discussions flounder because Tony just can not conceive of certain viewpoints and desires and creative processes that might be brought to the table by others that will confound the Capes experience.  The problem is also hard to solve in that sometimes the explanation that will work for person A will just make person B confused and trying to use both explanations simultaneously will just leave everyone confused.  Sorcerer suffers from this.  The real solution here is more self-awareness on the part of the designers with regards to what they creatively and socially bring to the table when playing the game.  In particular when discussing the game with others watch yourself for phrases like, "Well, when I run it I usually do X" because what you might not realize is that X is actually fundamentally required to make your game work as you intended and it should go in your text.<br/><br/><b>Clarity of Procedures</b><br/>Does the text actually convey how the mechanics work and in what order they should be applied?  Are terms used before they're introduced?  Are you describing a procedural point of play before it's actually time to use it relative to the other procedures.  Does your description of your mechanic accurately describe all its legal uses and all its procedural consequences.<br/><br/>My Take: This is a real issue and it's a BIG issue.  Capes suffers from this.  There are rules I only figured out how to use because of the examples provided.  To this day I'm unsure if I'm allowed to do ALL of the things I can do that top of a Page on my go or just one of them.  I know I'm all hot on Dirty Secrets but I'll point out that I think the concepts of Jurisdiction and Appeal are introduced a little too soon.<br/><br/>The Solution: The simplest solution is have others who have not read the text read it and see if they can explain the game back to you.  Another solution is to write your game in some kind of short hand like an explicit flow chart or an outline or like a simple set of board game instructions.  My Life with Master fits on a page when you do this.<br/><br/><b>Delivery Method</b><br/>This is quite simply the choice for distribution.  Pamphlet, .pdf, small book. large book, hard cover, soft cover, folder full of loose leafs.  Whatever.<br/><br/>My Take: I think this is an issue that is over looked.  Ron publishes It Was A Mutual Decision in a very unusual format for a reason.  My understanding is that Bacchanal comes as a kind of pamphlet.  I'm planning on publishing my own little game Misunderstood as a pamphlet.  There is no reason to pad your game up to book size if it isn't a book sized game.<br/><br/>The Solution:  I don't know if I can put this into words.  I want Misunderstood to be a pamphlet in some sense because I think the characters it portrays feel like digest versions of real people.  They're cute and small and sad and so I want the game to be cute and small and sad looking.<br/><br/><b>Production Values</b><br/>This is sort of a catch all category that covers EVERYTHING ELSE that takes talent.  Font choices, layout, art choices, back page blurb, front cover presentation and so on.<br/><br/>My Take: I think this is where I might strike some nerves.  I like my indie-games a little grungy.  I think professionalism can be dehumanizing.  And my heart goes back to something Ron once said about us not being an industry but hobbyist selling and trading games with other hobbyists.  I LIKE the stigma that we're designing for other designers.  It's not elitism, it's an invitation.  I did this!  So can you!  <br/><br/>I like Dirty Secrets's text and presentation because I feel like I'm talking with a fan of the genre whose kind of fumbling around in his own excitement and we're working together through these ideas.  Ron's academic lecturing tone works well for me too and while it's less interactive I still feel like I'm dealing with an individual person.  Compare that with Josh Roby who's so ultra-professional I don't feel like I'm dealing with him as a fellow hobbyist.  His call for play-testing and pre-order "press release" (the fact that I feel compelled to use that term is telling) here reads like something 5 guys in the marketing/hype department came up with after getting the product for the first time last week.  Spirit of the Century turns me off for similar reasons.  It just feels like the same dense dispassionate impersonal text trying to hit as broad an audience as possible that I would expect from the so-called "big publishers."  Talk to *me* your fellow indie-game enthusiast.  Fred's Don't Rest Your Head was written in the context of his anger over the Brain Damaged thread and his separation from The Forge.  That anger and the passion it instilled is all over that text and I think it's better for it.<br/><br/>The Solution: Set personal goals for success.  I've given my preferences above but at the end of the day that's just me.  Choose art and layout and presentation that match those goals and don't get caught up in what anyone else tells you unless they understand your goals and their feedback will help you fulfill those goals.  Don't design for everybody.  Design (here that includes the game and its presentation) for yourself first and foremost.  If you build it, like minded others will find it.<br/><br/>That's my take.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129368/#Comment_129368" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T15:00:16+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  3:00PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2008 3:00PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey that's good stuff.

If a product is designed and written with a certain aesthetic, that should be clear to me the moment I have the product in my hands.  If it cannot communicate that to me, the product has <em>failed</em>.<br/><br/>I am all for games that are different, and I am even all for games that don't appeal to me.  All I want is for the game and its designer (and to some extent, its fans) to be honest about that fact.  And on the whole, I don't think a lot of indie games are.  Which means, and I say this with all the gravity it deserves, that <em>we are lying to each other.</em> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129415/#Comment_129415" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T15:59:11+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  3:59PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><br/><b>Games That Take Practice</b><br/>[...]<br/>The Solution: I honestly don't know.

The Travel Hands in <i>Sons of Liberty</i> and Accomplishments in <i>Dogs</i> are great examples of how to introduce players slowly to the complexity of the game.

If I need to have the same play culture as you, and you don't articulate this to me, then your game has failed basic communication.

I also think that's teachable. I'm not saying that right out of the box you should be able to master it, but the book should at least point you in the right direction. The section on writing effective Muses in <i>Nine Worlds</i> is prime example on how to do that. It iteratively refines examples Muses, stopping at each step to show what's wrong and how to make it better. Town creation in <i>Dogs</i> is another one.

I know Spione talks about the Cold, so there's a finger pointing at your "drive a wedge between the spy and his home agency."  But I don't recall Sorcerer even telling you that you should "construct situations that put the character's humanity at risk."  Whether or not you can do it with artistic flair, and whether or not that flair can be taught in whole or in part, the book should, at the very least, tell you what you need to be doing!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
