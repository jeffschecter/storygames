The Sheriff gets to ask if someone is Mafia, and the Doctor gets to pick one person to save from death. Both roles are IMO crucial for the game to really fire on all cylinders, because they create opportunities for deceit, risk analysis, and occasional heroism. Having a Doctor adds a lot of variables to the Sheriff role -- it makes 'coming clean' earlier in the game an option, because painting a target on your head is no longer a guaranteed death sentence -- and also adds wiggle room in terms of the optimal ratio of Mafia/Civilians, since a single deathless night can easily turn the tables.<br/><br/>I have never heard of the Witness role, so maybe I'm biased, but it sounds really terrible. How do you determine if they've been noticed in a way that doesn't disrupt the gameplay, or require the Mafia/Werewolf players to risk further exposure? Also, combined with the Detective/Sheriff/Whatever that's two vectors for 100% reliable information on who is Mafia/Werewolf. The only advantage I can see is that the presence of the role would encourage people to claim that they 'hear something' during the killing phase -- which is of course the major source of hilariously overwrought speculation during the early rounds.<br/><br/>In terms of facilitating, I have no tips -- the most important thing in my experience is getting people over the hump when they realize that they are basically lynching someone on almost-zero evidence the first day. One or two zealous Civilians (or pretend-Civilians) go a long way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324439/#Comment_324439" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T10:14:54+00:00" title="May 14, 2011 10:14AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ross Cowman</cite>-narrate to let people know when they kill someone in the mafia or their detective</blockquote>\nMan, 8:2 and revealing identities upon death? That is some crazy easy-mode Mafia, right there. (Though I guess there's no Doctor, so that's something.) I haven't played in awhile but with 10 players I would go for 3 Mafia at least. Revealing identity on death is a good idea for new players, but if you're playing a second time I highly, highly recommend not doing so. Concealed identities encourage bluffing and elaborate impersonation gambits (as does having at least two special roles), which is the best thing about the game.

He wakes up every night and chooses someone who receives a sausage (could be a letter or something instead if you don't like it, but "korv" is a funny word in swedish since it's got a k). The only rules about him are:<br/>- He can never give himself one<br/>- He can't give a second helping to anyone before everyone currently alive has got a first<br/>- He's on the villagers' side<br/><br/>When I have a kill-free first night to learn who the wolves are, this means two things happen: the sheriff gets a first lookup and someone gets the first sausage, which sometimes works to start off the discussion.<br/><br/>The trick is to be just clear enough on the three rules: anyone that actually listens have to know what his deal is, but the kind of people who distrusts the facilitator or sticks to unreasonable accusations will try to draw strange connections to the sausage man and the mafia. Very often the mafia catches on and kills whoever gets the first sausage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324751/#Comment_324751" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T12:40:20+00:00" title="May 16, 2011 12:40PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Sometimes roles of the lynched were revealed, sometimes not.
