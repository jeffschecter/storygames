This final scene I'll not see                   <br/>
to the end...my dream                         <br/>
is fraying.                                           <br/>
<br/>
I finished up The Mountain Witch last night with my Wednesday crew. I've run TMW once before but we couldn't finish. This was the first time I've reached then end. Took us three 2 hour sessions. <br/>
<br/>
Wow. Bloody, dark, the bad guys won, utterly.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind as I describe this that I did not know what the characters' Dark Fates were until the game was over or just about over. I'll let you know how I feel about this at the end.<br/>
<br/>
The dark fates involved were:<br/>
<br/>
Worst Fear - Yoshinosuke: The character was actually a woman pretending to be a man, and was deathly afraid of being found out! The hints the player was dropping throughout the game went right over my head though, and we didn't find out about it until the game was over. But when we heard afterward this it all made sense.<br/>
<br/>
Desperately in Love - Sakura: The character was a woman (played by a woman). Unfortunately, the player didn't really pin down who her character was in love with. I think she (the player) was a bit disappointed because her character got killed before her dark fate could be fully realized. I do think she should have pushed it harder than she did.<br/>
<br/>
Unholy Pact - Hagenaga: I was sure this guy had Revenge the way he was playing it - when things finally flipped he was hell bent on killing Sakura, and even said, "You took the only person I ever loved." But indeed he was in cahoots with the Witch. He killed Sakura (chopped her up bad) and once the Witch killed Yoshinosuke, he said, "I've kept my part of the bargain."<br/>
<br/>
Basically what happened was, once they got into the castle, I separated them (Hagenaga fell down a chute). I told Hagenaga, "OK, you fell down this chute. Where are you now and who's there with you?" He said Lord Ravenstone (a recurring NPC from earlier on) was there. "What does he say to you?" "He says, 'Come with me to see the Master.'"<br/>
<br/>
Now at that point, I still wasn't sure what he was up to. Hagenaga had been a fairly loyal and stalwart character to that point. Was he just lying to Ravenstone to get close to the Witch? I didn't know, and it made playing Ravenstone and his reactions very difficult. So I had Ravenstone pull a pistol, point it at Hagenaga and say, "Let's go."<br/>
<br/>
We were in Act 3, and indeed we were about to hit Act 4 (it really does start all by itself). Yoshinosuke and Sakura run through the castles, slamming open sliding doors in chamber after chamber, and finally run into the one where Ravenstone and Hagenaga are waiting (with a horde of Lugo-men of course).<br/>
<br/>
"What the hell are you doing?" Yoshinosuke asks.<br/>
<br/>
"Excellent," says Ravenstone, looking at Hagenaga. "You've done well. Kill them."<br/>
<br/>
And here, Hagenaga went after Sakura. We used the duelling system and it went on for several rounds actually. Yoshinosuke was throwing Trust at Sakura (what little he had - they didn't get along earlier) and both Sakura and Hagenaga spent all they had as a Betrayal bonus against each other (they trusted each other a lot at the start). Sakura had some chapter wounds on her so she was basically done for.<br/>
<br/>
What was kinda frustrating for everyone was each time Hagenaga attacked he wouldn't give any clue as to why he wanted to kill Sakura. The player just said, "I'm trying to kill her." The other players started trying to make the point of their conflict rolls to get the truth out of Hagenaga. But no one had any trust left so it went on for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Yoshinosuke actually turned a killing blow by getting in between Hagenaga and Sakura (and getting a sword stuck through his arm) - the player spent his last Trust from Hagenaga to buy narration. But eventually Hagenaga took Sakura's head off.<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of this fight by the way, Yoshinosuke leaped on Ravenstone and head-butted him to death - awesome!<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, I was sure Hagenaga had Revenge, but the player hadn't revealed it openly, so we were all wondering why he wanted to kill Sakura so badly.<br/>
<br/>
So all right, I bring the Witch. He comes in and gloats. Yoshinosuke leaps over the Lugo-men to try and attack him. But without any Trust left they're both 1 - 1 on dice. Player rolls a 1, I roll a 6. The Witch stops Yoshinosuke's heart.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, we find out what Hagenaga is on about when he bows to the Witch and says, "I've kept my part of the bargain."<br/>
<br/>
The Witch laughs and his servant brings out a tray full of gold. "Enjoy it while you can, foolish mortal!" And we fade to black with the Witch's laughter echoing in the darkening chamber.<br/>
<br/>
So, in post game chatter, we asked Hagenaga's player what he was up to. He said that since he had Unholy Pact he thought he get people to trust him, which he indeed did. He also said he was maneuvering for a win however it went - if they actually succeeded and killed the Witch, they'd get the reward, but if everyone else died, the Witch would reward him. So his deception was actually pretty well played.<br/>
<br/>
But when he turned on the group, I, as the GM, felt I hadn't had enough foreshadowing. I found it really hard to help the players push their agendas because I couldn't target bangs at their kickers (the Dark Fates). The next time I play, I either want more from the players in terms of them setting things up, or, I want to know what their Fates are from the get go.<br/>

                            [continued from above]<br/><br/>Also, once all the Trust had been spent, we went a couple of rounds before Sakura finally got taken out. She had a lot of Chapter Wounds on her and a Permanent as well, but even with like a -4 mod she was still holding out, even with the duelling mechanics. This dragged out the fight a bit and because Hagenage wouldn't spill the beans (despite his having a reason not to even at that point) caused a bit of frustration from Sakura's player.<br/><br/>The players did well. Mostly for them it was the challenge of basically having more power to narrate what happened than they'd ever had before. It wasn't something they were used to. The guy who played Yoshinosuke had only ever played Rifts and D&amp;D (he was perhaps the best overall and he really seemed to groove  on being let off the leash). Hagenaga's player had played D&amp;D once, like, 10 years ago, and that was all the RPGing he'd ever done, so he was just plain inexperienced. He sure knew how to scheme though! Sakura's player came mostly from a White Wolf and AD&amp;D background and had only been gaming about 5 years so I can see where TMW was a bit of step.<br/><br/>All in all, it went well and the finale was indeed all about the characters. Everybody liked it and everybody said it had been a really neat experience with a game and play style they didn't know was out there.<br/><br/>It was bloody and treacherous, and I will absolutely play it again!                        </div>

What do people think about the GM knowing the Dark Fates? I felt I could have targeted the bangs better if I knew. This is the second time I've run it without knowing and I do find it a bit difficult not knowing.<br/>

                            Mike,<br/><br/>I've run TMW twice recently, and I had similar problems with the Dark Fates. I'm not sure what Tim's thinking was when he decided to keep the Dark Fates from the GMs. (Perhaps he will comment here and explain?) It's player-empowering to be in charge of them, but it's a bit problematic, as in your case. There are a couple of ways I would drift the rules as written, the next time I run it. Making the Dark Fates known to the GM would be one of them. Also, I might discuss details of the Dark Fates with the players: why do you want Revenge on X? Why did you make a Pact with the Mountain Witch? What is your Worst Fear?<br/><br/>Otherwise, it sounds like you and your players had a ton of fun, despite some hiccups.                        </div>

                            I'm glad you had fun!<br/><br/>Let me ask a couple questions---Did Yoshinosuke give Sakura trust <i>during</i> the duel? Did Hagenaga and Sakura betray each other <i>at the same time</i> or during a formal duel? 'Cause technically noone is suppose to spend any Trust during a duel except dead characters. I'm not sure if that would have sped up the duel, sometimes those things just take a few rolls.<br/><br/>Also, I just want to point out that Sakura could have continued to develop her fate even after she had died. There's nothing saying that dead characters can't continue narrating facts about their Fate. (Though I should point this out more on my website.)<br/><br/>The trick with not knowing a PC's fate is to encourage player exposition. Ask them to define game elements (whose decapitated head do you see?) and set up scenes where NPCs can question and prod the PCs. Try encouraging suspicion between PCs. Do stuff like that enough and usually it becomes obvious which they're holding, if they don't outright reveal them. I'll admit it's frustrating when players don't give you much to work with. This is another reason I try for long-ish games, it gives players more time to develop their fate.                        </div>

                            Tim,<br/><br/>Wouldn't it be easier if the GM knew the Dark Fates, but not the specifics? Then the GM could give them more tailored opportunities while still leaving the bulk of the work to the player? Keeping them secret from the GM cuts off a potential line of support. I realize there will be players uncomfortable with the shared narration of the game and would lean heavily on the GM to supply everything related to the FATEs, but a good GM can push back - and push along the right lines - if they're somewhat In the Know.                        </div>

                            Matt,<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with the GM knowing, per se.  But most of the time players don't know what they want their Fate to be in the beginning. It's kinda asking alot to ask them for the details during chargen. Lots of time, something will happen in the game that will inspire their Fate. <i>(He's holding a fan from his past lover... Wait! His past lover was my sister! Yeah--I want Revenge on him for dishonoring my sister!)</i> This is great for interweaving Fates together, which gives the game more of a "fateful" feel. <br/><br/>Part of it is just trusting that your playes will give you the neccessary foreshadowing. If they don't, well, just keep going with the other stuff (exposition, suspicion, and harsh adversity) and it will come out eventually. You can also use the "if you don't foreshadow, I won't change chapters" trick.                        </div>

                            Also Matt,<br/><br/>It's mostly the specifics that matter. Generally knowing which Fate a player has doesn't mean much by itself. Revenge? Against who? Why? Even if you knew, you would have to wait for the players to start foreshadowing stuff before you could really start going after them.<br/><br/>There's been times when I knew what Fate someone had (by figuring out what Fates they didn't have) but I still couldn't act because they hadn't given me anything to work with. <br/><br/>Do you mind writing a bit more about how your games went in regard to fate-related difficulties?                        </div>

                            Tim,<br/><br/>Happy to oblige. After all, I'm the schmuck who broke your game repeatedly on the Forge a month or two ago. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> If Mike wants to boot us to a separate thread, that's cool - I'm not here to hijack, just to explore some of the issues I feel he's raising.<br/><br/>I agree that details beforehand is asking a bit much. Just knowing the Fates might help me as a GM. As for foreshadowing, I have a hard enough time doing that as a GM. Asking a player, especially one new to the level of player empowerment that TMW allows, to develop their own foreshadowing is pretty demanding. Expecting it to "come out eventually" seems like wishful thinking to me, and not changing chapters until you get foreshadowing seems like punishment, not to mention a pace-killer.<br/><br/>That said, I'm having difficulty remembering a lot of the particulars of the two games I ran, as it was about a month ago. One game had two people new to role-playing, period, and everyone else in both groups had no experience with games with player-narrated outcomes. Mostly, I just remember not having a lot to work with. One of the newbies clued me in that she had Worst Fear, as her character was plagued by nightmares when she slept, but I don't think she ever really developed the specifics of the fear. (It may have been her character being violated, as she gave a vague speech to that effect near the climax of the game, but it wasn't really clear.) I do remember some after-game discussion among the players, but much of it was either "I didn't know you had Fate X!" or "What I wanted to do with Fate Y was Z, but I didn't really get the chance."<br/><br/>Ultimately, most of the players were looking to me to tell them what to do, even with the new power they had at their disposal ("Tell me what I'm supposed to say"), and it really felt a bit cruel to say "Dark Fates are up to you. I can't push to develop them." How much metagame discussion or table-talk do you expect in a Mountain Witch game? Should the player with Revenge ask another player at the table, "Is it OK if my character wants Revenge on yours?" and then discuss the details? Otherwise, I worry that you end up with Hagenaga, whose player kept his Dark Fate close to his vest and seemed to be following a very Gamist agenda.<br/><br/>I don't mean to come off as querrelous or accusatory - I love the game - but I find it a bit difficult to navigate and set the various sliders where they should be for the game to operate as intended. I look forward to response.                        </div>

                            Tim,<br/>
<br/>
To answer your first two questions, yes and yes. I didn't remember they couldn't spend any. But it actually didn't make any real difference because of the way the dice came up (a tie).<br/>
<br/>
By the time of the final conflict, no one had any Trust left - they'd burned it all, so it was entirely up to the dice to decide things, which resulted in Sakura getting Chapter Wound after Chapter Wound, and then somehow, miraculously not dying. Combined with Hagenaga's player not giving anything up, it was getting frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
At the start, all the players were keeping their Dark Fates very close to their chests, even in the 2nd session, and going into the third I still could only guess. I was really trying to stress to them that they could initiate stuff related to their fates and to try to foreshadow these things, but I think their inexperience hampered them here. <br/>
<br/>
As an aside, in a previous TMW game with a different group, I had one guy who hardly let anything out at all, and tried to avoid any and all bangs or other distractions. He took a straight up "Get to the Witch and kill him" mission oriented posture, so it was a bit annoying. Fortunately, the other players dragged him into stuff.<br/>
<br/>
For Yoshinosuke, I didn't know at all even after he died, that he had Worst Fear, although I have to say the things he did earlier on totally suggested it and they just went right over my head. In Hagenaga's case, I still couldn't guess what he had even after he bowed to the Witch, because what he did sure looked and sounded (and felt) like Revenge. Only when we declared the game over and I said "show me what you got" did we finally see he had Unholy Pact.<br/>
<br/>
Had I known what they were, I could have fired bangs at them more accurately, but still leave the development up to them. As it was I felt more like a was tossing hand grenades than sniping, if you get my drift.<br/>
<br/>

"It's mostly the specifics that matter. Generally knowing which Fate a player has doesn't mean much by itself. Revenge? Against who? Why? Even if you knew, you would have to wait for the players to start foreshadowing stuff before you could really start going after them."<br/>
<br/>
I'm cool with that. I have a couple which speak to the themes of the Fates but are not character specific. For example, for Desperately in Love: I have these two nagas in an underground lake that once loved the Witch and he cursed them, which they moan about when someone shows up (before they try to eat them), giving the PC an opportunity to reflect or say something about it, or bring in something of their own story. Once that happens, then I can hit them with more specific ones as they start to come out.<br/>
<br/>
Admittedly, this was the first time this group had ever tried a non-trad RPG (and I'd run some CoC and Godlike with them before TMW), so being a bit gunshy of taking the reins of their story is maybe natural. Afterwards, all of them commented on how different it was and how they'd never had a GM saying "Yes," so much or asking them to describe what happens or how things go. Sakura's player seemed particularly flabbergasted, and often when asked to describe an outcome or set something up, she was at a loss - I could see her looking to me to take over.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm rambling. Back to the point. If I run it again with experienced story gamers or even just people who've played TMW before, I maybe don't need to know. If I run it for another crew of less experienced players or those coming from more trad gaming backgrounds, I think I want to know at least what Dark Fate they pulled, then use the bangs to help encourage their development.                        </div>

Yes, I feel the same way.                        </div>
