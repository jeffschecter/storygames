I've written a number of dramatic scenarios for the game during its development, but they've all been in Finnish because I'm a difficult person.<br/><br/>Petteri's been doing a creative writing exercise after publishing the game, one that he calls <a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/#scenariodb" rel="nofollow">Scenario of the Week</a>: he's publishing one English-language scenario for the game each week, striving to keep up for a full year. He's recently started publishing translations from the Finnish-language selection, which means that my obviously A-grade scenarios are getting some air-time in English, now. Unfortunately he seems to be skipping the hilarious Finnish culture in-joke pieces in favour of things with more international flavour, but that's how it goes.<br/><br/>I wrote some really funny scenarios for the game last year (at least according to my own sense of humour), but the one Petteri published today just might be my favourite: <a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/scenarios/doku.php?id=super_mario_bros" rel="nofollow">Super Mario Bros.</a> is the harrowing tale of a pair of plumbers stuck in Naples during the confusion and anguish of the Italian Years of lead. (My apologies to any Neapolitans in the audience, the scenario text is quite intentionally from a cliched tourist perspective.)<br/><br/>Light-hearted farce is a somewhat rare and quite challenging genre for roleplaying due to how much it can resemble confused, failing play. This scenario, plus its actual play run when we tried it out last summer, is possibly my best stab at a traditional Hollywood farce ever. It is obviously very much inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._(film)" rel="nofollow">the hilariously awful movie</a>.<br/><br/>In case you're interested in seeing what other sorts of scenarios I've found imperative to write for the game, <a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/scenarios/doku.php?id=a_night_in_limehouse" rel="nofollow">A Night in the Limehouse</a> and <a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/scenarios/doku.php?id=astronaut_school_yggrasil" rel="nofollow">Astronaut School Yggdrasil</a> are also by yours truly. Perhaps we'll see more of these later, as Petteri runs out of ideas and is forced to translate more of my unique brand of genius to keep up with his schedule.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468638/#Comment_468638" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-28T21:24:30+00:00" title="December 28, 2017  9:24PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Lovely writeup!

Let me know if any thoughts emerge. I'd love to hear if you notice ways to improve the craft that is scenario-writing for Entropy.<br/><br/>(Language criticism may be somewhat unnecessary, this being mainly rough-and-ready stuff made for use. For instance, the translation for the Mario thing was something I whipped out myself earlier this week, raw and unedited. If it's intelligible enough to understand, it's intelligible enough to take to the game table as a starting point for real play. If somebody wants to edit it to shape, fine, but I'm not going to do it unless the game starts to gain some real traction out there...)<br/><br/>One thing about the Mario scenario that occurred to me while translating it is that I'm not too sure if the whimsical nature of the supposed genre of romantic farce comes through very well in the text. I originally wrote the scenario for an earlier iteration of Entropy that included something that might be termed "pivotal events"; a ready-made list of inspirational plot points that might or might not make an appearance during play. Much of the actual examples of what the genre is supposed to be resided in those. I remember how I was thinking while writing the scenario that even players who don't know the genre will surely grok it when they see a piece of paper on the table that says something like "A millionaire benefactor appears" or "Love at first sight" or whatever.<br/><br/>I mean, the Years of Lead is some grim shit to open with. I wouldn't blame a reader for deciding that this is intended to be serious misery tourism, even if I was personally thinking of something like the Blue Meanies from the <i>Yellow Submarine</i>.<br/><br/>When we played this last summer (for the one time it's been played, as far as I know), the event rule had long been discarded, and it went fine nonetheless - we got a plot-wise confused, action-packed, comic, heart-warming tale of how Mario and his surprisingly assertive old girlfriend Pauline found each other in a land far away from home. Could be simply because I was at the table to interpret the scenario; I might have said something at some point to make sure the other players got the genre. Reading that text now, it seems to me that you'll need to be intimately familiar with old-fashioned farces to understand how "Super Mario is lost in Naples" translates into wacky romantic hi-jinks. You can see the comedy, sure, but "comedy" is a broad term.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468640/#Comment_468640" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-28T22:35:54+00:00" title="December 28, 2017 10:35PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For someone who's never played Tales of Entropy, is there anything System-wise that would be important to know? <br/><br/>Most games imply some developments simply from their format, after all...<br/><br/>Could these scenarios be useful for any other games/game systems?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468641/#Comment_468641" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-29T00:07:01+00:00" title="December 29, 2017 12:07AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2017 12:08AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you'd find the game quite intuitive. It's very much like <i>Dust Devils</i> - a Forgite blood opera with dramatic scene setting, player characters with conflicting interests, conflict resolution in a central place in the game. No GM, though. Probably the biggest "thing to know" is that the scenario format intentionally only gives you a single "pivot character" instead of laying out an entire relationship map; the idea is that while one of the players will play the pivot character, the rest will create their own characters in opposition to the initial pivot character and each other. This scenario-development stage at the beginning actually "opens up" the written scenario, which only serves as a starting point.<br/><br/>For example, in the Super Mario scenario when we played it, the character creation went as follows (best as I remember it, anyway): <br/><b>1)</b> The "operator" - the player who chairmans the rules and reads the scenario out loud at the beginning - is presumed to play the pivot character (unless one of the other players "steals" it at the end of chargen). Because I was the operator here, I would presumably play Mario Mario. As we now knew one character for the relationship map, the other players could start thinking about their character concepts.<br/><b>2)</b> One of the players decided that he would play an antagonist to contrast with Mario's cheerful happy-go-lucky idiotism. This antagonistic character would be a Neapolitan parish priest, a seriously-minded cleric of the Catholic church, but also a covert supporter of fascist radicalism. A mix of awful and awfully stupid, as befits a bad guy in a farce. He is a "nemesis" of Mario, as the game terms it, because they represent different thematic interests: although Mario diegetically does not know it, in a certain sense he has been brought into Naples in our tale to oppose and overturn the vile designs (to be further elaborated upon later) of the evil priest.<br/><b>3)</b> A third player, seeing what has been established, chose to play a foolish local policeman. The fat and jolly type, oblivious to things, a suitable foil for farcical developments. He is technically a nemesis to the evil priest, however ineffectually, as he presents a na\xefve native understanding of societal harmony and a centrist denial of radicalism. "If everybody would just get along, we would be sure to get along well!"<br/><b>4)</b> Finally, a fourth player hit it out of the park by opting to play Mario's estranged fiance Pauline. (Believe it or not, that hadn't occurred as an option to me when writing the scenario.) She's found out where Mario and Luigi have gone (probably the latter tipped her off, really), and has followed them to Naples. Mad as hell at him abandoning her so callously, and defined initially in terms of opposition to Mario: while the hero foolishly desires to nobly sacrifice his own happiness to "keep Pauline safe" by escaping anonymously overseas, she views the situation in a rather different light.<br/><br/>As you can see, there are crucial creative issues that are left intentionally ambiguous by the Entropy scenario format. They're not really "adventure modules" in the traditional sense so much as they're jumping-off points that the group tackles to see what they can make of it. A setting, a situation and a character, in Forgite theory terms. It's generally held to be very auspicious if a group ends up discovering an entirely different scenario than the one the author initially had in mind.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Could these scenarios be useful for any other games/game systems?</p></div></blockquote>\nDefinitely. I've been very hesitant to talk about this with Petteri during game development, as I haven't wanted him to start making starry-eyed compromises for the sake of some generalized vision of "universal blood opera format" or anything like that. Nevertheless, the nature of the game has shaped to be such that it would be entirely trivial to lift the whole game-setup conceit from Entropy and use it with a different scenario-based game. The biggest limitation is probably the fact that Entropy is setting-generic, so any game where you can't adapt it to different settings easily might well be more trouble than it is worth.<br/><br/>I've personally considered trying an Entropy scenario out in <i>Dust Devils</i> or <i>Solar System</i> - both of those are generic in a similar way to Entropy, so it wouldn't be that difficult to just take the scenario at face value and adapt the game on the run to whatever the literary genre happens to be. Any game that does scenario-based blood opera would find no difficulty as long as you're able to convert the pivot character to the target system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468646/#Comment_468646" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-29T16:52:30+00:00" title="December 29, 2017  4:52PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, Astronaut School Yggdrasil leapt right out of the computer and grabbed me by the lapels (metaphorically speaking, as I am wearing a t-shirt) when I read it.

I think it's because of demographics - the guys are all 30-something classical pre-anime era geeks (and guys), they don't grok school anime [grin]. I'm very fond of the implied setting and the feel of the scenario myself, though, and will surely play it myself one of these days when I have a suitably young group to play with.<br/><br/>Writing these for Entropy has made me appreciate a specific facet of rpg scenario writing, namely accessibility: not because it is the be-all and end-all, but rather because it stands in stark opposition to colorful creativeness and artistic challenge. In other words: if you want a drama game to be fresh and challenging for its players, you have to push the creative envelope in terms of topics and treatment. That often means accepting a certain amount of befuddled pushback from the audience when you create something that inspires some people, yes, but also leaves others equivalently cold.<br/><br/>When thinking about that I'm often reminded of <i>Bliss Stage</i>. It's this absolutely wonderful <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i> ersatz rpg by Ben Lehman. Maybe not the world's most popular rpg; maybe in part because it's no <i>Dungeon World</i> or <i>Zombie Cinema</i> in terms of subject matter. Lots of my most beloved story games are like that: specific subject matters in exotic genres, out there in the land of stories that simply <i>cannot</i> be empty cliche regurgitation for your group because this is the first time some of you even encounter the genre.<br/><br/>Working with Petteri on Entropy scenarios has been particularly interesting in this regard, as he's got a very even, very conservative authorial style, generally speaking; his scenarios are outright plain most of the time. (There are exceptions, certainly, but that's the trend.) The extent of the contrast grew so clear for us during game development that Petteri ended up using Astronaut School Yggdrasil as a comparison piece in the game book itself when contrasting "easy scenarios that tell you what to do" with obscure, wide-open creative challenges [grin].<br/><br/>If you're interested in what I mean by plain, check out a couple of Petteri's "first batch" scenarios, <a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/scenarios/doku.php?id=in_the_shadow_of_the_great_wall" rel="nofollow">In the Shadow of the Great Wall</a> and <a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/scenarios/doku.php?id=the_iron_horse" rel="nofollow">The Iron Horse</a>. I think that I speak for a large swatch of the rpg culture if I say that these are outright accessible: common genres, common situations. They're simply <i>safe</i> in terms of subject matter and what a roleplayer knows how to do. Very easy to recommend for a first runaround with Entropy. On the other hand: while I do not dislike either scenario, neither do they actually bring anything to the table to excite me in terms of setting, character or situation; that will have to come from the players, then. (I've played both of these, and it was great fun in practice both times - but that's because the game is fun, not because of the scenarios per se.)<br/><br/>(As I intimated, not all of Petteri's stuff is ultra-plain, he's written several pieces that I actually find rather inspiring. My personal favourite may be <a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/scenarios/doku.php?id=dangerous_mind" rel="nofollow">Dangerous Mind</a>, the "I can't believe it's not <i>Firestarter</i>" psychic thriller. It's apparently so provocative that another member of the workgroup wrote his own version in <a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/scenarios/doku.php?id=awakening" rel="nofollow">Awakening</a> simply to illustrate his view of what the thematic weaknesses in <i>Dangerous Mind</i> supposedly are.)<br/><br/>As one might imagine, a game with this sort of capsule format for scenarios inspires a lot of polite debate about what it even is that we're trying to do when playing a drama game. Are you in a place in your hobby where you just want to have a successful session? Do you have artistic passions (for playing teenager astronauts with clear life goals, or whatever) that you want to bring to the table, even if that means asking the group to play something more difficult? Is the artistic challenge of executing a successful farce or whatever enough to get the blood pumping? Food for thought. I've known for a long time that I am myself often in that last category. The single reason why I even like <i>Zombie Cinema</i> is not that it's easy - it's that it's difficult in the right way, in confronting the player with their own skill as a storyteller [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468652/#Comment_468652" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-30T04:22:27+00:00" title="December 30, 2017  4:22AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Mario scenario made me chuckle to read.

The Finnish version in particular is ambiguously satiric of Star Trek; looking at the English text it's been toned down somewhat, but it's still about "what if captain Kirk never stopped captaining, and was a doddering old alcoholic at the end".<br/><br/>I think Tuomo, the author of the scenario, was thinking in satirical terms while writing the scenario, but we played it straight as an examination of mutiny and starfleet law in a situation where the captain has been judged unfit of command. Nothing comedic about that, I was reminded of <i>Moby Dick</i> more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orville" rel="nofollow">The Orville</a>.<br/><br/>(I remember that this particular playtest game was also interesting in that it featured the old boogaboo of roleplaying, early character death - I was playing the old Captain, and he was dropped like a hot potato in the very first scene thanks to bad dice luck. I'm happy to report that this did not make the game any less fun.)<br/><br/>Also, <i>We are such...</i> reminds me that I'm not the only one who's tried their hand at writing farces for Entropy. Petteri has done two that I can think of: <a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/scenarios/doku.php?id=honor_and_dignity_above_all" rel="nofollow">Honor and Dignity Above All</a> is an ersatz Jeeves &amp; Wooster scenario, while <a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/scenarios/doku.php?id=final_act" rel="nofollow">Final Act</a> is a Rambo-as-an-octogenarian scenario that Petteri himself for some weird reason thinks is a farce instead of tragic post-colonial character drama. Probably because he's finding it difficult to take '80s action movies seriously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PetteriHannila" title="PetteriHannila"><img alt="PetteriHannila" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PetteriHannila">PetteriHannila</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468655/#Comment_468655" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-30T07:28:22+00:00" title="December 30, 2017  7:28AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Mario is a great scenario and worked really well in actual play as well.<br/><br/>Maybe I'll get to Eero's hilarious Finnish culture snippets when I run out of ideas. Anyway I am always open for new scenarios to be published. It fills the void in my insides as a collector to populate the database with new entries and from new writers as well, so you are all most welcome to participate.<br/><br/>We have discussed about the scenario format via IRC quite a lot. As Eero stated, I tend to write "closed" scenarios, that is exact, pre-pinpointed dramatic situations that will be sorted out with cast generated by players. Eero tends to write "open" ones, as Yggdrasil showcases. This gave me a fruitful situation to use in the game book, to compare these kinds of scenarios for how they tick.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this openness should not be confused with approachability, though. Scenario can be approachable or avant-garde regardless of its openness, the former depending on the usage of familiar genres and situations that are easy (or hard) to build a drama game on.<br/><br/>As an example, I'll give my own avant-garde scenario: <a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/scenarios/doku.php?id=the_last_man_on_mars" rel="nofollow">The Last Man on Mars</a>. It is quite closed in my opinion, depicting a death-struggle of a last colonist on Mars, yet the dream-like starting situation and difficulty of creating characters push it to the avant-garde -realm of scenarios.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468660/#Comment_468660" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-30T17:53:12+00:00" title="December 30, 2017  5:53PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello,<br/>The text points at 3 directions : ridiculing the maffia/state/x, ridiculing Mario's dys-Italianism, heart pains. <br/>I find some references (terrorism, soccer) a bit far reaching for a quick game.<br/>The grains are neat.

The context of the scenario text in Entropy is that it's something that is read aloud to the group as part of the initial scenario selection. The baseline premise is that the text is pretty even-handed and distanced from the reader, essentially literature, but I've done some modest experimenting with other modes, making the presentation a little piece of rhetorical theater.<br/><br/>It's a questionable tactic in that I really should include "reading cues" for something like this where the text may seem somewhat confusing if read slowly in a monotone voice; it's supposed to present an excited feverish crescendo, that's why it becomes more incoherent towards the end. It obviously works better if the Operator (the player who reads these for the others) is familiar with the scenario text in advance and can prepare themselves to deliver it appropriately.<br/><br/>DeReel is observant about the throw-away nature of certain details in the scenario text - they are indeed somewhat unlikely to make an appearance, particularly every one and all of them in the same play-through. It's a virtue for an Entropy scenario, though, as the text serves them as an inspirational backdrop for the group's own ideas. The players can take it or leave it when it comes to incorporating football or the Catholic church or mobsters or whatever into what they decide to do. If all the other characters aside from Mario are created as sheep-herders from the hills, then that's what we'll be playing about, basically.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468662/#Comment_468662" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-30T20:37:34+00:00" title="December 30, 2017  8:37PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are quite good. I like both the more open-ended structure of Eero's scenarios (linked here) and the more focused, pointed nature of Petteri's. I've generally favoured the latter type in my own games, but that's mostly because I don't often get to play with the same people:<br/><br/>If I don't know how the players will react, it's nice to have a more "pointed" scenario, so that the setup is clear and we know what path lies ahead of us.<br/><br/>However, when I know the players will bring it, it's fun to throw something more wide open at them, and let them loose.<br/><br/>Another reason I favour the more "pointed" structure, though, is that if I guess wrong about how creative and/or active the players are, the "failure case" is less of a problem. <br/><br/>Giving an open-ended scenario to a bunch of confused or passive players can be a total disaster (or require me to do all the work of fixing it up to play). However, giving a "pointed", focused scenario to a bunch of people who ARE ready to be creative and inventive still works fine:<br/><br/>* They can play along, and create characters who fit perfectly into that kind of scenario, and we'll have a good time playing it.<br/><br/>* If they choose not to play along, though, we can easily "open up" the scenario and approach it obliquely. <br/><br/>Perhaps we treat the focal conflict of the more "pointed" scenario is something happening in the background, for instance, and position our characters in unusual corners of the thing. For instance, the scenario is about a posse of bandits robbing the bank, and the Sheriff's men who must deal with them? No problem: we'll create a few helpless employees at the bank, and play out the romantic entanglements between them as the robbery happens!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468663/#Comment_468663" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-30T20:41:51+00:00" title="December 30, 2017  8:41PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I'm not sure about - not having read or played the game - is how these scenarios turn into actual play.

(For instance, in the case of Super Mario Bros., the introductory paragraph has, really, nothing much to do with the Super Mario farce, and it's only reading the character description which clues us in to what we're actually meant to be playing. Same goes for the Yggdrasil scenario - the thematic cues which give us an idea of what the game might actually be about are all in the character writeup, it seems to me.<br/><br/>So, what do we do next?

It's an interesting way to look at scenario design!<br/><br/>As for "Mario Bros", for Eero: my initial impression just from that brief writeup is that I would play it very serious - somber, gritty, dark. The comedy that comes from including the Mario Bros. references in the game would be for the players only, not in the fiction as well. In other words, if someone was observing that game but NOT familiar with the Super Mario Bros., <i>they would miss out on the comedy entirely</i>, and just see a fairly somber story of poverty, crime, and heartbreak.<br/><br/>At least, that's what I see there - my first reaction to it.

You might want to think of these scenarios as sort of portable GM prep: the game doesn't actually have a GM,but it is <i>sort of</i> as if the scenario author was a GM prepping a game for the players. He preps the milieu, he preps the situation, he even preps a player character for himself, but he stops just barely before he's actually committed to a given dramatic arrangement. Rather than telling the players that "this is what we're playing now", it's more of a question: "Given this character, what kind of story would we construct around him?"<br/><br/>The key virtue of this choice is that it is a strict commitment to providing the maximum degree of support possible without losing the freedom that doing your own character generation and relationship mapping provides. We all know that it's possible to prep further, but it is not possible to prep further <i>and</i> still allow players to have real say over the thematic content of play. I think the balance chosen here is because there is genuine value in having the players contribute characters and issues to the game.<br/><br/>Specifically: if there was no prepped characters at all, then the scenario would either lack dramatic stakes (it would be just a milieu), or those stakes would have to be communicated in the abstract. There is no dramatic particular without particular characters. You could still have setting-based issues, but how do you actually, concretely encourage players to address those issues when they go on to develop the scenario to completion at the game table? It's pretty weak-sauce to just say that "this scenario is supposed to be about slavery, OK?" and expect the players to care if the claim doesn't have any teeth. The pivot character provides those teeth by concretely laying down the starting point of the relationship map. No matter what the players do, that character will be there, soaking up screen time. (Plus, the rules require and demand that you create your own characters in relation to the pivot character; no such thing as ignoring it, by the rules.)<br/><br/>Contrariwise, providing more than one character would not only enforce dramatic priorities (these are the official characters, anybody else you introduce will be support cast in comparison), but it'd also leave the players to determine who gets to and has to play each of those characters. It would not usually benefit the creative activity at the start of play to have more ready-made characters.<br/><br/>That being said, there's no particular reason why one couldn't write a scenario with more characters ready-made; it wouldn't require major changes to the procedures of Entropy for a scenario to have e.g. two pivot characters. If I thought up a scenario that worked better with more characters fixed in place, I would certainly write it that way. If the question of how blood opera games should be prepped interests you, I would invite anybody and everybody to try this out in practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468666/#Comment_468666" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-30T21:54:20+00:00" title="December 30, 2017  9:54PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And how do the other characters come to life?

It resembles <i>Legends of Alyria</i> more than anything else, if you're familiar with that game. Or <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, I guess - Entropy is pretty similar to that game, too.<br/><br/>The core lifeline that ensures that player-created characters actually have heat is the nemesis rule: every character has to be a thematic antipode (somebody who wants different things) of one of the prior established characters. It's simply not a legit character if you're not doing that, and it's playing it wrong if you think "I want to play a wizard" or something like that. What you're supposed to be thinking in character creation is not who or what your character will be, but rather: what is the intimate thematic value of this other character already established? What will it be that my character will be created to destroy? You think of the other person, not yourself.<br/><br/>For example, with this Super Mario scenario your first task as a player is to answer this question: what does Mario represent for our story? What does he want? Who is the antagonist that brings ruin to everything he does? Coming back to the question of why the scenario texts in Entropy stop halfway, I think there's immense creative value in having the game ask this question of you: it keeps the scenario-author honest, they have to actually communicate something interesting and trust the anonymous player on the other end to make their own, sometimes bold and nonsensical choices.<br/><br/>One of the perennial armchair testing procedures we've used in the Entropy workgroup to gauge these scenarios has been drydock speculation about that very question: given that I was playing this scenario right now, who would my character be, in juxtaposition to the provided pivot character? I think we've generally been in agreement about the idea that a well-crafted scenario needs to be one where it's easy enough to think of not just one answer, but many; if the scenario really only has one answer to "who my character needs to be", then perhaps it really should be a scenario with two pivot characters? Establish those and <i>then</i> ask the players to pick the rest.<br/><br/><i>Super Mario Bros.</i> is actually at the upper end of the spectrum of accessibility by this gauge: the answer to "who my character needs to be" is not super-duper obvious, I think. Thinking about it right now, I see three basic choices:<br/><b>*</b> Invent a Darth Vader type villain, an evil extremist or criminal. Serious in contrast to Mario's comic nature, as evil as Mario is good. Maybe don't bring king koopa Bowser into it, or if you do, make it a really grim portrayal so Mario still gets to be the goofy one. Prepare to be the player who brings the political and social upheaval of the milieu into focus: you should have goons tramping all over the place, and you should over-react to the slightest of offenses.<br/><b>*</b> Luigi. You could also (later, once more characters are established) create Luigi as a true buddy movie ally, but making him an actual nemesis for Mario would be interesting. I can think of plenty of reasons and ways in which Luigi would resent Mario here: Mario ruined their lives in New York, he continues to depend on his brother to be the responsible one, he's a constant foil in Luigi's romantic life... really, pick your favourite SMB fan fiction head-canon and go to town on it [grin].<br/><b>*</b> Pauline. This would be an amazingly bold choice for a <i>first</i> character pick (in our playthrough she was the last character chosen), as you'd essentially be saying that this is gonna be a romantic comedy - the primary, most important issue in this scenario is clearly Mario's masculine obviousness in leaving his girl behind for paltry reasons. Or I guess you could do serious character drama; maybe Mario just didn't care for her that much to begin with? Maybe she's not coming to Italy to win him back - maybe she's coming as a mob hitman, that'd certainly be a farcical turn if played right.<br/><br/>There are obviously other options once you start digging, but those are what jump out at first flush, and none are exactly obvious in terms of "what would Gary Gygax do" that so dominate dramatic creativity in RPGS. (Well, OK, Gygax would probably go for the Evil High Priest approach. Still, even that requires you to establish the character whole-cloth, as the scenario text doesn't give you anything to go on aside from the Mafia idea.)<br/><br/>I personally find this a very fruitful way of creating characters for a blood opera. Sort of obvious, even. It's especially wonderful right at the start when there's only one character in prior existence: somebody at the table has to step up and decide which way this scenario development is going to go, by declaring to the world that <i>this</i> is the antithesis of the aforesaid character, this is what I want to focus on. After one player makes that choice, the next player starts having a bit more elbow room, as they have two characters now to start from: either make a second nemesis for the initial character, or jump off the new character the other guy invented. You could reinforce the other guy's choice of themes, or you could pick apart a different thematic strand to work on. Maybe character A opposes the pivot in personal psychological terms, while character B opposes them politically?<br/><br/>Once play starts you're just supposed to play your characters genuinely, uncaring of the initial relationship map, but generally speaking a well-executed scenario development stage will ensure that you have something to sink your teeth to, drama-wise: start with scenes that further illustrate the differences between the characters, continue into scenes where they bash each other's brains out over said differences. Occasionally have surprising turns where characters that were initially established as enemies avoid mutual destruction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468667/#Comment_468667" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-30T22:00:31+00:00" title="December 30, 2017 10:00PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>As for "Mario Bros", for Eero: my initial impression just from that brief writeup is that I would play it very serious - somber, gritty, dark.

I use something similar when I create NPCs for games, sometimes, and it's always quite effective.<br/><br/>But how do I figure out the "intimate thematic value of this other character"? <br/><br/>I can assume a number of things from his write-up (and, in particular, his Traits), but the write-up doesn't nail down a particular central theme that I can easily identify. Perhaps it's something like, "the common man hero, committed to hard work and his scruples, who suffers as a result". <br/><br/>However, I think it's actually a strength of the write-up that a few possible threads could be focused on - whether it's his mafia connections, his lost love, or his fledgling plumbing business. In practice, I think I would want to question Mario's player and find out which of these he's most interested in.<br/><br/>There is no procedure or process for that player to lend more focus for Mario? Creating a fictional goal for him, for instance? That would be my natural inclination - to tease that out.<br/><br/>If that was not on the table, though, I would position myself opposite whatever I found most interesting. Here, it's hard for me to say whether it would more interesting to dip into all of the issues or just to choose one. Perhaps the number of people participating in the game would decide that question for me - how much room do I want to leave for later contributions?<br/><br/>My immediate go-to's would be as follows (I'm intentionally not giving this too much thought, for the sake of the exercise):<br/><br/>* Mario is brave and honest. <br/><br/>Therefore, my character is a paranoid coward who's got his fingers into everything. A "spider-like" manipulator heavily involved in crime who's obsessed with controlling every variable.<br/><br/>Presumably, I would want Mario out of the picture, because his digging (perhaps literally! my secrets might be underground, or hidden in the sewer/water pipes beneath the city) threatens my carefully-constructed nefarious schemes.<br/><br/>More interestingly, maybe I would see Mario as the perfect stooge for my schemes - I would want to enlist him as a naive conspirator to carry out one of my plans. Perhaps I need to free my boss from his cell, and I plan to do so via a sewage pipe, so I hire Mario to "fix" a missing link between the prison's sewage and a nearby building I rent temporarily, enabling the rescue. Mario will need to be either arrested or killed afterwards, of course.<br/><br/>* Mario is trying to operate an honest business in Napoli.<br/><br/>He doesn't realize that plumbers here don't operate without the permission of the mafia. I may be a competitor of his, or a local mafiosi, who needs him to understand this. I seek to force him to pay tribute for his own "protection" (in order to keep operating the business), or to force him out of my turf (perhaps out of the city altogether!), because he threatens my business.<br/><br/>Perhaps his employees are people I have paid off; stuff like that.<br/><br/>* Mario is broken-hearted about Pauline.<br/><br/>I am rich and spoiled brat; someone who has earned an incredible fortune through dishonest means, and therefore connected to the mafia in all kinds of ways. I appear strong, brave, handsome - the perfect gentleman - but my skin is extremely thin.<br/><br/>I was recently in America, and Pauline fell in love with me. So I have brought her back here as my fiancee. She's not really in love with me, probably, but sees me as a perfect antidote to her disastrous relationship with Mario (although she may still harbour feelings for me!). Furthermore, Pauline has worked very hard to convince myself of what a good person I am, unspoiled, and ignored and rationalizes anything questionable about me - surely, she thinks, she wouldn't be so dumb as to end up with someone connected to the mafia yet again?<br/><br/>I like your idea of actually playing Pauline herself - that's far more interesting - but in that case I'm not entirely sure what her goal might be. How is she opposed to Mario? I suppose she could see herself as having a good life here, in Napoli, and become committed to making sure Mario leaves before he *ruins everything* for her!<br/><br/>More interesting, perhaps, would be to take on one of these roles as Luigi. Turns out the reason his Italian is so much better than Mario's is because he has been connected to the Italian mafia all along!<br/><br/>An interesting exercise; I can see how a few iterations of this can produce a really interesting relationship map.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468669/#Comment_468669" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-31T00:04:58+00:00" title="December 31, 2017 12:04AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I somewhat intentionally didn't read your choices before I composed my message.

I made a sort of "scenario starter", similar to these in spirit, although more detailed in many ways (it's supposed to last for a handful of sessions instead of just one, for instance). Most significantly, I use a mix of labels and roles to create a number of colourful NPCs or personas with the players. <br/><br/>AW's playbooks are meant to be combined with the three "Love Letters" I wrote to then position the PCs around these colourful personas.<br/><br/>The thread about it (and the PDF I put together) is here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21404/apocalypse-world-crows-flats-skyfall-a-mini-campaign-starter" rel="nofollow">Crow's Flats: Skyfall</a><br/><br/>The reason it's relevant in this thread is because what I ended up with is very similar to what is being discussed here:<br/><br/>I have a basic "catchy" concept and some colourful potential characters. <br/><br/>Then, one of the players announced that she would be playing Blind-blue - one of the "important personas" generated during the setup. This is VERY similar to the "scenario + one main character" presentation of the Tales of Entropy scenarios: we have a general sense of the setting and situation, and then one important character who gets more of a focus, in order to focus on a specific aspect of that situation.<br/><br/>The problem, though, is that AW isn't intended as a blood opera (although it can be!). I thought the Hx choices would create enough context for the PCs' relationships to each other, but in practice I don't think that they did. <br/><br/>Now, I am struggling a little bit to find which aspects of that scenario to focus in on. Positioning the characters as antagonists to each other is a really economical and easy way to do that, but we didn't do that. Now I'm really curious to see what other ways might be used to tease out a strong scenario from all this starting material. <br/><br/>Did you try any other approaches while developing Tales of Entropy?<br/><br/>Does anyone (reading this thread) have some advice for me in terms of finding that focus?<br/><br/>Feel free to contribute here or over there, as seems more appropriate, according to your answers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468672/#Comment_468672" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-31T01:42:02+00:00" title="December 31, 2017  1:42AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Question: given that each NEW character forms a conflict with an existing character, is there any necessity, then, to "close the chain" and figure out whether the first character should be positioned in opposition to someone created *after* him?

The shadow of the only character with a pre-conceived write-up usually looms rather large. The player who's tackling the pivot character, the "Operator", is also generally assumed to have plenty of agency anyway in extra-systemic ways, because he's the player who's presumably introducing the game, interpreting the rules and so on - you know what I mean, the facilitator person in a GMless game. It'd be rare for this player of them all to be creatively sidelined.<br/><br/>Also, it's an interesting choice to do exactly that, sideline the pivot character. The freedom is there if you find it creatively necessary. I mean, the rules don't demand the stars of you when it comes to including individual characters: exactly one character needs to have an adversial relationship to the pivot, and that single relationship could be very abstract in fictional terms, merely thematic. That could be an interesting exercise to play, to see what one might tease out of such complete refusal of the situation implied in the scenario text.<br/><br/>(For example, one could play this Mario scenario by the rules by declaring Pauline as the 1st character, except she's still in New York, and mightily miffed at Mario, clueless of where he is. She's antagonistic, but we have no clue how this antagonism will truly come up in play, if it does. Should every other player after the first choose to create characters in relation to <i>Pauline</i> instead of Mario, we'll get something really weird and interesting: a story set in New York, with a distant B plot set in Naples. One could ignore Mario all but completely.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I've toyed with making a scenario-creation procedure for TSoY/Solar System using a similar technique, although I've never actually carried it out.</p></div></blockquote>\nI've been thinking that I'll probably do something bold for a convention in February: I'll run Solar System with the Entropy scenario rules. This implies that I won't know what we'll be playing in advance, and I'll need to be able to improvise the SS crunch landscape on the fly. On the other hand, Entropy has much sharper and tighter scenario-developing than default Solar System, which is quite meandering. A worthy challenge!\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But how do I figure out the "intimate thematic value of this other character"? <br/><br/>I can assume a number of things from his write-up (and, in particular, his Traits), but the write-up doesn't nail down a particular central theme that I can easily identify.

I, being an asshole, have obviously not gone to the trouble of spelling it out on Mario's forehead here - you need to interpret it out of there [grin].<br/><br/>The "you" there is the whole group, though - this is one of those Forgite story games that you play together, everybody contributing to solving the issues. In practice the game procedure requests that the players start with a sort of a communal brainstorming stage where they produce multiple potential answers to this central question - they produce potential character ideas, that is. So you wouldn't be alone in trying to figure out what makes Mario tick, everybody would presumably have their own ideas. And you would do well to listen to the Operator, who's going to be playing Mario, if they have something to say.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, I think it's an important power that you get as a player: you get to make your own interpretation, your own call. The only limit is that if you tarry, another player might move to steal the march on you and declare their character first. That will again irrevocably change the dramaturgical balance, forcing you to re-evaluate your options. Aside from that your power to make your own interpretation is rather absolute: the point of the scenario is not to be something that tells you what to do, it's to be the object of your doings. Whatever you see in there is the right answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468673/#Comment_468673" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-31T01:42:15+00:00" title="December 31, 2017  1:42AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Dealing with this whole discussion has been really interesting for me, because I just started a short-run game of Apocalypse World.</p></div></blockquote>\nI find this thread interesting as well. This is something I've been fiddling with on the side-lines as Petteri's been working on the game for a while now, so I'm happy to share some of the fine points and concerns. Plus, I'd like to convince you to write a scenario for the database.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Did you try any other approaches while developing Tales of Entropy?<br/><br/>Does anyone (reading this thread) have some advice for me in terms of finding that focus?</p></div></blockquote>\nPetteri might correct me, but I think he's tried out "everybody just make some characters that fit together" and "I'll write all the character into the scenario in advance so they'll work" in practice before hitting on the adversial relationship map thing as a midway point between freeform and no-form. I was probably somehow mixed in with that idea myself - we were spit-balling about it around then - but I forget the particulars.<br/><br/>Obviously I've been immediately intrigued by the more general question - why and how should an antagonistic relationship map be the most powerful or most general procedure for procedural development of blood opera scenarios? It's a really obvious idea, but also a really simple one. Is it really the full width and breadth of drama, to set up colorful characters in opposition to each other?<br/><br/>I'll note that historically the mainline of story game dramatic theory in this regard has been a bit different for some reason. The most common way of "relationship mapping" focuses on positive relationships: you establish why the characters care about each other's concerns, and ensure that everybody is tied together by a web of duty. That, plus overriding important needs that put stress upon the web of relationships, is the recipe.<br/><br/>In the desk drawer of enticing ideas that didn't quite make the cut for Entropy lie a few half-worked alternate procedures for setting up the relationship map. One of them is a take on the above: instead of making your character the nemesis of the pivot character, you create somebody whose destiny is conjoined to theirs, but who also has a life - a Goal - beyond the other character. So in e.g. <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> a valid character under this scheme would be "Luigi, the loyal brother who wants to quit the plumbing business", for instance. Essentially, each character is drawn apart by their own desires and their loyalties to the web.<br/><br/>As you can immediately see, a positive mapping procedure like that is inclined to produce a more mature and measured dramatic scenario. For me it's an old struggle to match a true blood opera conflict resolution system with something like that; if the game of Entropy emphasized internal conflicting loyalties over external enemies, I'd want a conflict resolution system where the stakes weren't constantly escalating. It's like playing <i>Pride &amp; Prejudice</i> with <i>Dust Devils</i> (a friend once developed and published that exact thing in Finnish as a sort of tongue-in-cheek supplement): the lethal, binary conflict resolution system contrasts powerfully with the nuanced psychological drama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468674/#Comment_468674" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-31T01:56:37+00:00" title="December 31, 2017  1:56AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That being said, a word about your <i>Apocalypse World</i> woes: you've got a default Apocalypse World dramatic set-up which you need to get moving.

This achieves the same thing relationship mapping and such techniques achieve in advance: you orient the players on what their characters want and care about. Just be mechanical about it, run introductory low-plot, low-tension scenes for characters A+B, A+C, B+C... until you've got a firm grip on what the characters mean to each other.<br/><b>*</b> External threats should be used to destabilize whatever it is that the characters care about. An ensemble drama works by bringing crisis to one character in turn, generally speaking, and then showing how the other characters react in unison to either betray or support the character in crisis. The AW text focuses a lot on this aspect of it already.<br/><b>*</b> Weaves and crosses should be used to tighten up the relationship map (and plot) as play progresses. Characters who have weak connections and motivations should get support from dramatic coordination that emphasizes how their decisions impact each other.<br/><br/>An important point is that relationship scenes produce two "goods" that you want to establish powerfully: aside from relationships, the other is goals. Characters who meet each other and talk to each other in a drama game should basically be talking about one of three things only:<br/><b>*</b> What they mean to each other.<br/><b>*</b> What they are going to do about the on-going crisis.<br/><b>*</b> What they desire from the future.<br/>If your establishing scenes, relationship scenes, or whatever they're called, don't deliver those things, you need to sharpen up so they do. You see how running these scenes will establish the relationship map by force, even if it's been left sort of vague in pre-play. This is a good thing, as 90% of the various narrativist drama games don't actually have much of a pre-play scenario prep procedure. If you couldn't do this stuff in play, you couldn't do it at all.<br/><br/>Note how the above is all canonical <i>Dust Devils</i>, pretty much.

I'd like to add some further clarifications on the issues presented here.<br/><br/>Eero already described the brainstorming-phase and how the characters are then brought forth by the players as nemeses of previously defined ones. Lively brainstorming results in a paper full of ideas and characters concepts from where to draw upon. It is common to combine multiple concepts for a character, if there are plenty of concepts and ideas still on the paper (so that other players have room to pick interesting narrative characters).<br/><br/>In addition to the characters, players get to fiddle with the game world as well. The grains defined in each scenario are small snippets of interesting narrative "rules" that give bonuses during conflicts. Players get to add their own grains there as well and the grains also change (increase in value, are destroyed) during the game. Introductory grains are usually large, "meta-rule" -type of concepts but players can also bring forth things that are more precise, like interesting locations, npc:s and so forth. Also, unused concepts from the brainstorming list can also be transformed into grains here.<br/><br/>A short introductory vignette is played for each character before the actual play starts. This positions the characters regarding to the issues presented in the scenario narrative and often reveals some interesting bits from the characters' past.<br/><br/>I've found that this process gives enough meat on top of the bones given in the scenario narrative to start playing the game.<br/><br/>Regarding to the different compositions of pre-made characters. I actually haven't played this game ever without any characters, but the initial short playtests included only pre-made characters. After I learned that character opposition seemed to bring the best results drama-wise and after some discussions via IRC I ended up with the current system of one pivot-character.<br/><br/>Later I also created a "mini-entropy", a version of the game I ran in a gaming convention. It had only pre-made characters that were in each other's throats so to speak, and streamlined rules-set to get the action going as fast as possible. This way the game usually took about an hour, when we kept each scene as intense and "large" as possible to drive the story forward.<br/><br/>Normally a game of Entropy takes two playing sessions, the first to define things and characters and play a little and then the second to wrap things up. I have played quite many that were wrapped up in one session and some that were slower and lasted three or even more sessions. It all depends a bit on the speed of the initial setup, but the most defining factor is how "big" the played scenes are.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468686/#Comment_468686" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-02T01:19:35+00:00" title="January  2, 2018  1:19AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2018 1:20AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don\u2019t know why but your website won\u2019t load on my phone.

Essentially you're looking for the games that have mechanical tools for assigning meaning, and that don't constantly drum on the idea of continuous conflict. The polar opposite of a game like <i>Fiasco</i> or <i>Zombie Cinema</i> that all but mandate a "conflict in every scene" approach.<br/><br/>What would I highlight particularly... what comes to mind first are <i>Kagematsu</i>, <i>Bliss Stage</i>, <i>S/lay w/ Me</i>, <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> (played in a nuanced way), <i>Steal Away Jordan</i>, <i>Urchin</i>, <i>Primitive</i>... my list quickly gets into really obscure games. Many of my favourite non-conflict-y story games are nowhere near popular. The rise of the evil Freeformers (and their nefarious leader Megatron) doesn't help things any as they steal the thunder from real game design in this area [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468733/#Comment_468733" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-07T17:36:17+00:00" title="January  7, 2018  5:36PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good observations, Eero. I've seen some nice attempts to create or re-create slower "down" moments in gaming, and Kagematsu is a nice example of mechanizing and rewarding "small steps".<br/><br/>When you bring up <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, are you referring to refreshment scenes? Otherwise, it doesn't seem that different from another conflict-oriented story game to me.<br/><br/>Notably - and perhaps surprisingly, given the high-conflict nature of the game - <i>Monsterhearts</i>, I find, does this very well. It's the only game I've played where subtle glances, someone keeping quiet during a conversation, and small moments like someone taking off their jacket can have powerful meaning consistently. (Although I suspect that most people do not play it this way! Nevertheless, many of the moves enable such moments, and "gaze into the abyss" is quite explicitly about quiet introspection, which is fairly unusual for an RPG).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468734/#Comment_468734" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-07T18:20:05+00:00" title="January  7, 2018  6:20PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>When you bring up <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, are you referring to refreshment scenes?

The game is not very strongly scenario-based, and its campaign planning resides in an ambiguous place between strict basis on scenarios and the looser idea of following characters around and seeing them fulfill their personal stories. In my experience this ambiguity encourages a proliferation of set-up and introspection scenes that establish the reasons for up-coming conflicts and consequences of past conflicts.<br/><br/>In other words, the game's just plain slower than your average blood opera. Not in any strictly enforced way, but rather as a consequence of its particular approach. You can play tighter by up-fronting more scenario material during chargen and building characters tighter into the scenario, but the default way is for the GM to create stuff and introduce it slowly in drips and drabs during play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
