I haven't played before, but it was wonderfully fun.<br/><br/>We decided we were children in wartime Jersey. John played a Boy Scout who hated the war; Steve played the boy who told tales; I played a girl who liked guns; and Alex didn't play a child at all, but an elderly witch.<br/><br/>The questions on setting creation were excellent. We decided the magic should be like an English fairytale: fairies, trolls and so forth. I decided that my character had "Gun Magic", although we only began to establish what that meant. Finally, we decided that magic should be "happy and bubbly".<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, John's character was given a Hitler Youth uniform and told to put it on, which he did. When he walked through the woods, my character (quite naturally) shot him. We then found Alex's witch in a cave in the woods and ended up on the South Cliffs, where a water spirit reared out of the water and scared us away.<br/><br/>We ended up staying out all night. This was fine for me, because I was an orphan. However, Steve's character was locked in the attic as a punishment. John's character was caught, as he crept in at dawn, by his saccharine-voiced elder sister.<br/><br/>We only just got started, but the game was promising. The only problem was that the "happy and bubbly" magic never seemed happy and bubbly. Every time I described flowers growing and birds singing, it just sounded sinister. Perhaps it's me.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274132/#Comment_274132" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T16:01:14+00:00" title="June  2, 2010  4:01PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you have a lot of mechanical resolution-moments in your session (like with the chips and the blind bidding and such)?

There <i>wasn't</i> a conflict over whether I shot John's character: he was happy being shot. <br/><br/>I'm loving the side bets. They create these wonderful moments where everything gets resolved at once. At one point, I was trying to shoot a water spirit; someone else was trying to take the gun off me; and the water spirit was trying to scare us both away. It worked really well.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
