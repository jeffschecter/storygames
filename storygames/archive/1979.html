                    Quoting Chris Pramas of Green Ronin:<br/><br/><i>"The new core city book, the Pirateâ€™s Guide to Freeport, will be a 256 page campaign setting with no rules material at all. In other words, a pure setting book that can be used with any fantasy RPG you like. Weâ€™re then going to be offering a series of companion books in print and PDF that will give you game info for various systems. The first two will be the True20 Freeport Companion and the d20 Freeport Companion. Others will follow."</i><br/><br/>I'm kinda hoping for a TSOY Freeport book, actually.  I'd play that shit.  We should convince one of the SG folks doing freelance work to get on proposing that to Green Ronin.  Though one of the cool things would be feeling like you could run a Freeport game at a convention or at your local store and then whip out whatever cool system you like, seducing the d20 crowd to our Kool-Aid drinking ways.  I imagine there's already some folks planning to play <i>Burning Freeport</i> or maybe even <i>FATEport</i>. <br/><br/>Green Ronin has always made the smart move of presenting Freeport as a kind of modular setting component that could fit itself into most D&amp;D-style fantasy worlds.  But this is the first effort by a large game publisher (that I know of) to present a setting separate from any rules set that you could use to run it (as opposed to those kinda lame books which include rules for a half dozen very similar systems).<br/><br/>Granted, it's going to be a setting custom-built to run fairly traditional roleplaying campaigns, so it's not completely adaptable to running, say, <i>Freeport: Breaking the Ice</i> (though pirate dating would be fun!), but it's an interesting publishing model that sorta moves roleplaying more towards the domain of fan fiction.  Here's our setting!  Now use whatever system you want to tell stories in it!<br/><br/>How do folks feel about this?  Interesting idea?  Silly idea?  Bog-standard idea?                </div>

It's certainly not a new idea - HÃ¢rn has been published rules-indepentent since 1983, though it has always remained only moderatly succesfull. Green Ronin does have more publishing and marketing muscle, though.<br/><br/>Personally, I like the idea a lot, since it's versatile; you get the setting information and then you can choose if you wish to buy a rules supplement, or just adapt the setting into rules you like. Sure, it's more work, but the kind of tinkering a lot of people like to do. Especially if they let people put fan-made adaptations online.                        </div>

<blockquote>For me, not new or interesting. There has not been any good setting written for a roleplaying game and I do not think this one will be the first.</blockquote>
Shreyas, if you think that no setting has ever been good, or really can be good, then how much can we really take from your opinion of this? I mean, if I hate all organized religions, would my opinion of Judaism really be a meaningful one to hear?<br/><br/><br/>Personally, I like the idea, to an extent. Let's, for a second, imagine that Freeport gets really, epically big in the RPG world.<br/><br/>On the one hand, it can provide common ground. GURPS-heads and d20-heads and TSOY-heads could conceivably all discuss their Freeport campaigns together. The GURPS guy could be like, "have you explored th Alchemist's Cove much? There's this really cool adventure seed in it..." And then the TSOY guy is like, "Well, actually, my group plays a bit more like X than like Y". Suddenly, GURPS guy and TSOY guy have found common ground to talk on. GURPS guy knows a bit more about TSOYs playstyle, and he learns they really aren't from different planets afterall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the other hand, what it does is makes sure d20 people keep playing d20 products, GURPS people keep playing GURPS products, FATE people keep playing FATE products, and there is little cross-over. One of the big draws to trad games is their dope-ass settings and races and classes. If they are all available to all systems, then it stops people from ever trying something new. And that is potentially a Bad Thing.<br/><br/> </div>

<p>Well, you couldn't. But I didn't say that second bit. That's important.</p>
<p>I think you can, honestly, say something like "I have eaten of many carrot cakes and I say that they are all terrible, but it's clear to me that carrot cake <em>itself</em> isn't terrible; simply that all these expressions of it are, and maybe someday a good carrot cake will exist."</p>
<p>That's what I am saying.</p>

                            What I'm wondering about the hypothetical TSOYport book is what would actually go in it? How big would it need to be?<br/><br/>My second thought is what would be in the 256 pages of GR's setting that I'd want to use, or even read, for that matter.<br/><br/>I'm not saying I don't loooove setting, on account of cuz I do, but I'm having a little trouble imagining a need for 256 pages of setting, unless there's plenty of cool pictures and maps and stuff. Maybe it's a clash of preferences, and I'm in the wrong thread. JW, what would you want out of that 256, and out of the TSOY sup?                        </div>

It may have worked before, but where are we nowadays? There's an ageing market that keeps shrinking and shrinking, while competition for new blood is tougher than ever. We just can't keep throwing unnecessary hurdles in front of new gamers.<br/><br/>Saludos,<br/>JongWK                        </div>

                            JongWK, I don't really expect most new roleplayers are going to walk into a store and pick up Freeport.  And, if they do, hopefully GR will direct them (in the text) to the SRD on the web or Fudge or something.  Honestly, I don't feel it's all that different from required the PHB and DMG in order to play D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Matt,  yeah, clearly some of Green Ronin's expectations about what players want from a GIANT TOME OF SETTING aren't going to necessarily jive with what TSOY or Burning Wheel players want.  Speaking personally?  Yeah, about 50-100 pages of setting (like the stuff in TSOY) would probably be plenty for me.<br/><br/>However, if I was writing the TSOY supplement this is what I'd do:<br/><br/>Take the GIANT TOME OF SETTING and break it down into specific Keys and Secrets, where Secrets were more like the loresheets from <i>Weapons of the Gods</i>, modular bits of the setting knowledge that characters purchased to bring them into the game and make them central to their character's development.  So you'd have a list of things like:<br/><br/><b>Secret of the Howling Reef</b> (see Freeport p. 124-125, 216): This secret provides characters with knowledge and special abilities related to the Howling Reef, with the following costs and effects:<br/><br/>5 XP -- Basic: The character knows that the Howling Reef is swarming with undead sharks who guard a mysterious underwater treasure.  Location unknown.
<ul>+2 XP -- Origin: The character knows that the sharks were created by Davy Jones' former right hand man, the Crimson Stooge, and that the treasure was stolen from Jones own sea chest.</ul>
7 XP -- Marked by the Reef: The character possesses a tattoo of the map to the reef on their inner thigh.  If purchased at character creations, it has been there since early childhood.  Otherwise, it appeared one morning after a night of drunken debauchery.  In either case, it sends them shark filled dreams of a treasurebox that calls to them.<br/><br/>Etc.<br/><br/>And so you'd break the setting down into Secrets and Keys, provide some basic guidelines for running a pirate game, and be done in 100+ pages or so.  But also, yeah, it'd only be a project I'd be really excited about if 1) the Freeport book ends up being really cool and/or 2) it builds up even more enthusiasm for TSOY or other neat systems.                        </div>

                            As mentioned before, the ground has been tilled, I see no reason this couldn't be a success... oWoD had a ton of setting stuff that had no game system junk in it. In fact there were a goodly chunk of setting supplements that were written largely in the form of (ptu!) game fiction.                        </div>

                            The idea leaves me cold, but most because for the character-centric play that I enjoy, the tome of setting is cart-before-horse thinking.  I don't want to read a setting and then install a character into it; I want to create a character and then develop the setting from which that character springs.  Note that by 'setting' I mean lists-of-important-NPCs-and-locations-and-how-they-relate, usually presented in an exhaustive manner.  I prefer my "settings" to be evocative before they are prescriptive -- like TSOY's Near, which says "Maldor has lots of feuding nobles" and leaves it at that, rather than drawing out a map and saying who's got the steel mines and who guards the forest of ship masts and blah de blah blah.  All of that is useless if not directly destructive to the way I prefer to play.  I'm not sure if Green Ronin is aware of the extent to which their "rules-free setting" is actually rather constrictive.<br/><br/>On another note, I think it's worthwhile pointing out that Freeport was not created in this format, but has developed into it.  The original Freeport was written for... whatever system it was originally written for (D&amp;D 3?).  It got a lot of adherents in that form, and became established in the gaming world.  Now it can stretch out a little into other systems (one of which is GR's house system).  I would be highly skeptical of a product presenting a new setting in such a format.  I don't think you can <em>start</em> there; you have to come to it with a fanbase first.                        </div>

-For me, personally, I totally agree.  As a small press publisher, I want to create as low a barrier as possible.  For some companies, though, it may not be the best model.  Green Ronnin I think is a good example.  I think they really might be on to something with True20 (look at Blue Rose).  So I don't begrudge them attempting this model even though for myself it would be totally wrong at this time.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            A few random thoughts because it's 1 in the afternoon and I still haven't eaten breakfast: <br/><br/><i>1. People who play what they play because they already play it.</i> Also known as "Design What Doesn't Matter" or "We already know what an RPG is" or lots of other terms. While most of us disagree on whether its a good thing or not or if you'd want to design for it or not, we do seem to have some agreement that there are a lot of RPers out there who mostly get books to support the way they already play, rather than to learn to play a new game. For these folks this kind of setting seems to be a potentially good idea, as it fully supports the way they play -- stip-mining settings for ideas and adventures and cool bits, while not having mechanics that they'll not use anyway. If they aren't going to use your mechanics, why put mechanics in the book? <br/><br/>Big issue with this, from a marketing perspective, is getting these people to realize that's what they're doing when they're used to buying books with "crunchy bits" only. Green Ronin's companion vollumes may work for this, as players are also used to the idea of needing to buy multiple books to get a complete game, so, we'll see. <br/><br/><i>2. Ain't it funny how much setup counts</i>. Much as they're not the hotness they used to be, I know a lot of folks around here who gave love to Exalted in the way back, and who fairly recently were loving Weapons of the Gods. Exalted, as of Scavanger Sons, had probably 250+ pages of setting, and WoG has to be damn close. But Exalted spread it out over 3 or 4 books at the start, and WoG had it written by Rebecca and (kinda sorta) tied to character and world generation. So those go down with our crowd much more smoothly. And Burning Wheel has that much setting info, but it's built into the game mechanics so that one becomes the other, and this is awesome. <br/><br/><i>3. Cliche and Not</i>. Now, pirates are pirates, but I think its worth considering when we start getting ready to bad-mouth big setting books that the ability to run a game in any setting without having at least a big chunk of information on that setting has to do with how generic or familiar the setting is. A lot of Indie games make heavy use of external, mass culture tropes in order to drive their gears, and this is awesome because it gets the game rolling fast along channels we all understand. But it can be problematic for those wanting to get into exploration of settings, cultures, or ideas that are not part of "what we all know (at least kinda)." <br/><br/>So while I don't know that a big setting book is needed for pirates, I would very much like one for when I'm going to be playing in Warring States China with people who've never even watched Crouching Tiger, or for any game set in India where the folks at the table only barely know what naan is. (Or even with those that have some idea about the area, but not enough to do anything beyond the generic and obvious.) <br/><br/>Also, having a strong background in a setting is sometimes needed for a developer. Thor and Luke have both said, in the past, that to make a full set of lifepaths for Burning Wheel you have to have a pretty intimate understanding of the culture you're burning. The work I've seen folks do on Burning India games pretty much confirms this for me. So, if you have to start somewhere, and if you want to do it for something non-generic or non-pre known, you need to do a lot of research and work into the backgrounds of stuff. If the research and work you're doing is into fictional stuff you're making up yourself, well, you may end up with a document that has a lot of things traditionally seen as a setting book. And at that point, why not offer it up as well? Not even as something necessary, but maybe as something extra for those that want it?                        </div>

I'm going to guess and say that Luke doesn't put that in BW books because he hates writing it.  I think it has led to some really interesting setting material where the setting is conveyed through character generation and play.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of punchy text and enjoy the hell out of writing it, so if I were to write a BW setting, it'd have a bit more prose.<br/><br/>I like that BW just has what is necessary.                        </div>

This is why <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> has two or three pages summarizing classical mechanics from the era.  Superficially, it's so players can throw around "kinematics" and "dynamics" and "torsion" when they're doing their technobabble, but scratch that surface and you discover that the Victorian understanding of the universe colors a lot of their thinking, and hence, the rest of the setting.                        </div>

Honestly, I don't feel it's all that different from required the PHB and DMG in order to play D&amp;D.<br/></blockquote>
Hi Jonathan,<br/><br/>Even Wizards has the <a href="https://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/966470000" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Basic Game</a> for new gamers, an "all-you-need-to-play" pack for $24.99. The 3-core books are for the existing fanbase and people who want to take the next step into the hobby, not the first one.<br/>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: # Troy_Costisick</cite><br/>For me, personally, I totally agree. As a small press publisher, I want to create as low a barrier as possible. For some companies, though, it may not be the best model. Green Ronnin I think is a good example. I think they really might be on to something with True20 (look at Blue Rose). So I don't begrudge them attempting this model even though for myself it would be totally wrong at this time.<br/></blockquote>
The thing is, do you sell to people who already play, or do you try getting new fans? If you look at videogames now, you'll see a similar question.<br/><br/>By the by, I love True20, but the published settings make me cry (except for the Arabian one).                        </div>

                            If Shreyas had asked me the question - which he wouldn't because he knows my answer - I'd have answered "I don't." That is, I think that relying on the homogenaity of commonly held visions of play is not only acceptable, but quite empowering. Paul always talks about this.<br/>
<br/>
So I've got elves in my HQ game. And they have pointy ears. Or, better, in the otherworld games the people there have whatever ears we need them to have when we need them to have it. Like JBR try to rely on canon.<br/>
<br/>
But...I do understand the impetus to this sort of thing. I don't think it's a great product neccessarily (that's another debate). But I do get the idea of the "hard" game world. And this is what setting texts are for, IMO. To have a reference to a stable world that does not vary at GM or player whim. Something that seems to have a sort of existance to it.<br/>
<br/>
I think that this sort of feeling may actually inhibit actual play, mind you. You get lots of players who own books, look at them, and long to play in them, but never do. But I understand the desire in question.<br/>
