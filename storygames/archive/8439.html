In my experience, folks go "Awwww..." and they smile, and they get quiet and listen, and when there's tender touching heartbreak they tend to get a little choked up, and all that.  In short, my experience is that an awful lot of people <i>love</i> this stuff, and appreciate it quite readily.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo doubt part of this is a question of your gaming community, but I'm interested to get some <i>overall</i> sense.

This may be because I have played with a disproportionate share of cynical misanthropes, though. Typically, introducing things such as happy relationships, family ties, nostalgia, and the like are taken as an invitation to stomp on the object of those feelings in order to "get to the good stuff", which was the fighty-killy-thrashy-intriguey-angsty. Occasionally, it's just been laughed off uncomfortably.<br><br>I have had a few good experiences with this sort of thing, but almost universally they occurred with the confluence of three factors (I don't know if these actually mattered, but they correlate).<br><br>1. Predominantly female players and/or female GM<br/>2. Dirty hippie games that explicitly encouraged such content<br/>3. Non-fantastic or minimally fantastic genres<br/><br/>As a GM, I've had mixed success introducing that sort of material. Often, it seems to lead to creative differences within the group, as one or two players dive in whole-heartedly and the others disengage and/or go looking for something more boom-bang.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186530/#Comment_186530" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T08:55:21+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  8:55AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we assume that most roleplayers are youngish males, then I think it's a defense mechanism.

Lore was rituals of domination and submission.  Demons were guns and tattoos and cell blocks.<br/><br/>The most significant moment of the game was one PC putting his hand on the shoulder of another PC.  (Humanity gain roll!)<br/><br/>I still remember that moment.  I love that moment.  (The guy who comforted the other PC was a convicted ex-cop who murdered his own partner.  He was the last guy you'd think would ever be there for someone else.  It was genuinely moving to see the guy shift as the shit hit the fan and he had to make choices where to stand.)<br/><br/>And it's not at all the sole tender moments I've played.<br/><br/><br/>I'd offer that in <i>stories</i>, tender moments need to stand out in contrast to something that isn't tender.  If things are just, you know, <i>good</i>... then not much is going wrong.  Stories are about the equilibrium of life collapsing due to one reason or another.  <br/><br/>So, it's hard to <i>force</i> such moment, I think.  But I think they often emerge as characters figure out their priorities (through the players of course), or the players realize, intuitively, they need a shift in tone to make the crisis bearable.  <br/><br/>But no... In S<i>orcerer, Sorcerer &amp; Sword, Primetime Adventures, Grey Ranks, Dogs in the Vineyard, In a Wicked Age...</i> I've found plenty of tenderness to spare.<br/><br/><br/>I just read some more posts that were made while I was typing.<br/><br/>I will tell a story.<br/><br/>When I sat down to play Grey Ranks at a local con (with some fantastic players, and Denys facilitating for us new players), I said before play, "I have one favor.  This is about some terrible stuff.  World War II.  The disaster of the ghetto uprising.  Jews being sent to camps... So.  Tone.  If we could keep a tone for the game, that would be great."<br/><br/>And early on, when someone did crack a joke (a good one! to relieve tension!) I laughed, but slapped my hand on the table and shouted (playfully, I thought) "Tone!"  <br/><br/>I would later make a joke myself -- and Denys slapped the table and shouted "Tone!"  Which got a big laugh from all of us.  But it rallied us once more and kept us on track for the setting, situation and story we were making.<br/><br/>Which is my way of saying, that as a GM I run a tight ship.  And as a Player I try to encourage room for the appropriate tone as much as possible.  Some games should be laugh riots.  Others, not.  Some, a mix.  But it's up to me to make some decisions about what I think is worth pushing for at the table.<br/><br/>I'm willing to push for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186544/#Comment_186544" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T09:19:30+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  9:19AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>I'd offer that in<i>stories</i>, tender moments need to stand out in contrast to something that isn't tender.

Aaron, however, was falling for Meg, who's this totally nice and smart girl in their class.  Aaron asks Julie to help him, because he doesn't know anything about girls, and she's his best friend.  So Julie helps Aaron spruce up his act, and ask Meg out on a date, and it works.  Julie comes over to help him get ready, and straightens his tie, and gives him a hug at the door and smiles shakily and wishes him good luck, and he walks away to go and be happy with Meg.  Julie is left there smiling, and proud, and crying and miserable.<br/><br/>That's tender, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186555/#Comment_186555" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T09:33:53+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  9:33AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 9:34AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never saw the other thread but for the start... so I'm just responding to this one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186557/#Comment_186557" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T09:47:02+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  9:47AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like this would depend entirely on the local gaming culture and the sort of games people play. Sure my play has plenty of tender, touching moments, but I can also easily imagine the local culture that got stuck in the year 1995 and simply doesn't have the tools for this sort of stuff - something as innocuous as total player-character identification combined with a strong GM can make all emotional content really explosively disturbing. I'm thinking of the sort of guy who'd saying something like "I would never play a romantic scene with my best friend, Jimmy - it would just feel too weird." The hidden assumptions about what exactly is going on in the game and how players and characters are equated are so overpowering here that I'm not at all surprised if a group with that technical agenda never has any sort of emotional content in their games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186564/#Comment_186564" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T09:58:57+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  9:58AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Tony,<br/><br/>Yes, it is tender.<br/><br/>I'm going to do a sidestep here, as we're about to start defining moments of "tender" and what is "good" and so on... and I think these words are slippery and context dependent.<br/><br/>I might have leaned to heavily on the second post in this thread (Mark's) for context, and so if I've caused confusion, I can only say, "Didn't mean too."

Here I chose to make the little critter wail and cry, not out of fear of the big adventurers, but out of grief for its big dead freind. As I described it trying to bury its big friend the players one by one took pity on the thing, and in the end they all help burying this monster. The scene was incredibly tender. It still sticks out in my memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nContrasting this to several scenes in the same game that were delightful (and funny) between the ranger and his newly adopted dog, which were great character setting moments, they carried no particluar weight. They wouldn't have stayed with me if it hadn't been for the AP write up of that game. And here is the point isn't it. Any scene that is to carry any emotional weight has to spring naturally from play, and unless there is a littel edge to it, it won't stay memorable. They can't be forced. That is my experience at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then to prevent the dick and farts joke you need all the players to engage in the moment. And here in lies the challenge IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have plenty of techniques to have the players engage in conflicts, because conflicts trigger something in us. It takes a lot more set up to have the players engage in  happy relationships, family ties, nostalgia, and the like, unless there is some conflict at the source. I can toatlly see a player narrating his characters having breakfast in bed with his wife become a glorious and beautiful moment in play as a part of narrating a Strength in 3:16 because of the contrast it will have to the brutal nature of that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186584/#Comment_186584" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T10:45:28+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 10:45AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry to have muddied the waters.

He's always seemed very much into the idea of exploration of "tender" moments.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most interesting such was during a Riddle of Steel game, where a romance played out between him (playing a female) and another male player who was fairly traditional, strongly macho and somewhat given to adolescent behavior. To everyone's mild surprise, it flowed easily and was believable. It ended up being an ongoing theme for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat game ended up finishing prematurely due to some expectation clashes between myself and the players, but that's another topic completely.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a rule, what Tomas describes has been fairly common. Either tender behaviors have been avoided entirely, or mildly mocked and disengaged from it. There have been a handful of players across my experience with whom such things didn't seem so awkward.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, now that I think of it.. In the Star Wars (WEG) game I played in during my first enlistment, the GM brought several opportunities for such play into the game. I ended up playing two characters simultaneously (short but somewhat convoluted story behind that...) and both of them were presented with romantic overtures from outside their race. Corwin shied away using his goal of becoming a Jedi as an excuse. Kimber made light of it. In a way, I now realize, it was my own discomfort with the idea of exploring romantic themes with a bunch of guys that made me react this way.

The more bearable instances ended in machismo displays, awkward sexuality or mild temper tantrums. The less bearable instances became emotional manipulation and abuse between players. It wasn't all male players doing these things, either, not by a long shot. Nor did I see this in a single group, but observations over many groups, including some live-action roleplaying, totalling somewhere over a hundred players.<br><br>The most common excuses I hear:<br>- violence is just a normal part of games, you can't change that<br>- that's just how my character would act<br>- many ad hominem attacks too impolite to bother repeating here<br><br/>I wish I knew a way to turn this around, because the ugliness definitely wears me out, especially when players use in-game nastiness to hurt each other out-of-game. The only instance I can think of real tenderness in a game was when playing with a couple of friends who are practically family to me, and literally family to each other.

To have such a wonderful tool at your disposal, and to see it abused like that; must be frustrating.<br/><br/>I've been in a lot of great interaction on love, friendship and comfort, and some pure poetry too, in both ordinary rpgs and larps. Role-playing games are naturally suited to cater for any kind of human interaction. You only need the right method to support your interaction, and the game will sing any song.<br/><br/>Since I published the naive, poetic rpg <i>Muu </i>in 1989 (Norwegian, not translated), there has been a widening of themes to be had in role-playing games here in Norway. The landscape is still skewed towards the standard action-drama (and it will always be), but you have so much more to choose amongst nowadays (including the games from your indie-scene).<br/><br/>In the Nordic larp-scene the picture is even more promising. The multitude of themes to choose from is great. No one needs to sit and cry for want of play in any part of the emotional spectrum. <br/><br/>I would wish for you to have more of caring and exploring players around you, Graham, to be served with a multitude of different games (you are, in fact, through this commmunity), and to have free reins with positive co-players to discover all kinds of happy and fun play.

I've had the most such moments when roleplaying with non-gamers, people new to roleplaying.<br/><br/>I have two theories about this:<br/><br/>1. The roleplaying culture is coming out of an adolescent mindset, and those who remain gamers into later age simply want to continue in the same vein, in the same tradition, that they are used to--the style they created as young teens. New recruits have to conform to this to play with the grognards, or they leave.<br/><br/>2. Traditional RPGs (basically, most of the games on the market) have such a heavy focus on combat and life-threatening action that roleplayers become conditioned, over the years, to associate all fun with combat and danger. I;ve had many people tell me (intelligent, mature people) that an RPG without combat is like pizza without grease or sex without sweat.<br/><br/>I can see how that would happen--when the systems are all designed to give you more fun out fighting and skip over everything else, over the years a certain message will set in to your brain: "this is the way it always is".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_188580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188580/#Comment_188580" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T23:57:36+00:00" title="January 15, 2009 11:57PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bret: my experience mirror yours.<br/><br/>Paul: I've been thinking along the lines of your two hypothesis for years.

Combat is an accepted and occasionally savored by-product of RPGs. RPGs without combat are still, yanno, RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like adventure in my RPGs. Adventure means physical danger and combat, to me. That isn't to say that tender themes should be left out though, nor even that they should take a back seat. Tenderness can, and even sometimes should drive the play.. Sometimes, even combat can be tender.<br/>\n<br/>\nMetal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater does a pretty good job of it. In the final battle (SPOILER) you're running or sneaking around fighting The Boss, and she's shouting encouragement and advice to you the whole time. She's your mentor, your partner, your friend, and you have to kill her. Imagine if she wasn't just a character in a movie/game, and and/or imagine if you'd actually built that relationship up over time yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheories for why notwithstanding..

Even classical role-playing games may be created without a ridiculous focus on combat, and be high in excitement and adventure. My own game <i>Romance!</i> is generally more exciting than the ordinary combat-focused rpg. It has the advantage of investing all kinds of conflicts with importance, not only the physical ones. Even <i>dancing </i>may be designed to be exciting in a role-playing game, if you let it count. It really does count in <i>Romance!</i> - you may be <i>socially dead</i> if failing your roll when dancing with the princess!

The roleplaying culture is coming out of an adolescent mindset, and those who remain gamers into later age simply want to continue in the same vein, in the same tradition, that they are used to--the style they created as young teens. New recruits have to conform to this to play with the grognards, or they leave.<br/><br/>2. Traditional RPGs (basically, most of the games on the market) have such a heavy focus on combat and life-threatening action that roleplayers become conditioned, over the years, to associate all fun with combat and danger. I;ve had many people tell me (intelligent, mature people) that an RPG without combat is like pizza without grease or sex without sweat.<br/><br/>I can see how that would happen--when the systems are all designed to give you more fun out fighting and skip over everything else, over the years a certain message will set in to your brain: "this is the way it always is".</blockquote>\nI think both those hypotheses are spot on actually.<br/><br/>That said, I don't personally think rpgs are the best medium for stories in which tenderness is expressed, but others may well differ and the reason they're not served is in large part the two reasons you cite.<br/><br/>I'm British, we don't actually have tender emotions so the issue doesn't arise anyway.  I suppose a manly quiver of one's moustache might be permissible, but it strikes me as dangerous emotionalism best left to foreign people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189208/#Comment_189208" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T14:39:43+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  2:39PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2009 2:40PM by ccreitz.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>Tenderness and violence aren't opposite ends of a spectrum.</blockquote>\nIt's a staple of kung-fu movies that, when a student ends up defeating his/her master, that their final fight should combine violence and tenderness.

To register required posting about some personal story (I don't recall how exactly) in a manner which struck me in all honesty as profoundly culturally American.  That alone put me off the forum, which isn't knocking the forum (there's plenty of fora that are great that I choose not to post to for various reasons) but it may be relevant here.  That kind of confessional/sharing thing is I think more a cultural trait of the US than a necessary consequence of tender emotion.  To do it myself would have felt profoundly dishonest.<br/><br/>Which takes me back to your first question come to think of it, to me an active, personal display of emotion at the table smacks more of grandstanding or shallow emotionalism.  I would tend to expect real emotion to be quiet, not discussed.  But then, although I have no moustache to quiver and although the stiff upper lip thing is largely as extinct as the whalebone corset, I'm not American and we do have slightly different expectations here.<br/><br/>Interesting stuff, good question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189395/#Comment_189395" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T12:06:24+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 12:06PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Is the active, personal *display* of emotion at the table the same thing as the ability to create tender, emotional moments?</blockquote>\nAbsolutely not - not even remotely close.
