I'm just looking for a way to look at the whole "kill and loot" concept with a framework that doesn't make me cringe. I have two ideas so far:<br/><br/>You ARE criminals - In a setting where you are members of a criminal organization, murder and betrayal are common. You can only survive by protecting  yourself and keeping yourself protected. You can never truly leave this criminal world, and your kill and loot methodologies are considered criminal. This might work best for games where you're mainly facing intelligent races. Maybe Planescape?<br/><br/>Killing Monsters is like Busting Ghosts - Something makes monsters spawn in this world, and it is up to the athletic and adventurous to save us all from them. Each dungeon might be a home built by something alien like:\n<ul>\n<li>the cracked pieces of a meteor swarm, embedding themselves in the earth, generating a weird, malign magical force<br/></li><li>either the video game Okami where the environment and humanity poison each other until the source is removed or the DitV idea where pride leads to all sorts of sins that might just manifest into murderous creatures<br/></li></ul>\nOther ideas for a fun setting that resolves the dissonance of heroes that murder and loot?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204388/#Comment_204388" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T07:22:09+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  7:22AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read a series of books where monsters were the leftovers of a wizards war that tore the world apart.

It\u2019s pretty horrific! I was quite surprised. Essentially the world is ancient with civilizations built upon civilizations. Most of the world is consumed by chaos, evil, and rage. There are few areas of safety, the points of light, where civilized people not consumed by this chaos gather for their own survival. But these points of light are rare, fleeting, and vulnerable. <br/><br/>Adventurers can be defenders against the encroaching darkness, treasure hunters, or both. Since you\u2019re practically drowning (if it wasn\u2019t for that makeshift raft that\u2019s starting to snap) in an ocean of evil that wants to rip your skin off and wear while it eats your family, it\u2019s not too hard to create situations that justify the D&amp;D experience. <br/><br/>In general, I try to stay away from monsters like goblins. They feel too civilized in some ways! I try to think of the opposition as cthulhu type monstrosities. And goblins don\u2019t quite fit that for me. And since the outside world is literally kingdom built upon kingdom, treasure is a plenty. Looting bodies is generally pretty fruitless (you acquire so much money so quickly that only magic items tend to be worth your wild) that it tends to be more about finding ancient forgotten artifacts of a time long past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204394/#Comment_204394" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T07:36:35+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  7:36AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, maybe that would be interesting ... the tides of darkness, once repelled, could leave behind the ruins or natural areas they were inhabiting allowing the residents of the heroes' village or town to expand and increase their "point of light".

Monsters swarm the city. Jungle (or desert or your choice of impassable terrain) floods the streets. Lots of people die.<br/><br/>Then a few special citizens start exhibiting special powers (D&amp;D races and classes). They are the heroes. <br/><br/>Justification for murder? Survival. If you don't kill these things, you will die. They will kill you, your family, and your friends. Your community is hanging by a thread as it is. A silo of unspoiled grain is a bigger treasure than 10,000 gold pieces. A source of clean water is better loot than a holy avenger +5.<br/><br/>If you need more justification, realize that you are protecting your home. You didn't ask for the monsters to climb over the walls and start smashing down your house. You didn't invite the undead into your tavern and smithy. You were minding your own business, going to church, making a living, tending your garden.

We just heavily leaned on that much-forgotten rule that you can choose to incapacitate, rather than kill, an opponent when you reduce them to zero hit points or less. The D&amp;D detectives and cops "incapacitated" (read: slammed up against walls and shackled) a lot of perps that way, and if they killed anyone at all, it was purposeful (at least at the metagame, story-telling level).<br/><br/><b>The challenges of not-killing</b><br/><br/>The problem with not-fatal defeats is that it leads to a prisoner "problem." If you're in the dungeon, it's tactically difficult to leave enemies behind. They come back to get you. Or they dehydrate and starve to death if you leave them there. Or other monsters get them and eat them. There are additional moral dilemmas imposed on players who don't want to kill. <br/><br/>I've seen some hand-waving techniques to solve these problems. Captured enemies never escaped, never got hurt or starved, and were easily transported back to town for trial and jail. Some DMs supplied magic items that tossed captured enemies into a pocket dimension -- a sort of stasis -- for safe and easy transport. Or a magic item that could forcibly change a monster's alignment ("curing" them of their evil -- this might tweak the moral buttons for some people, though, and rightfully so).<br/><br/>You can also make captured enemies very valuable to PCs. Make every captured enemy give up useful information willingly (without torture! geez!). <br/><br/><b>Ultimate Justification</b><br/><br/>I don't think anyone has really said it though. Why justify? D&amp;D comes with its own built-in justification: Evil. In the Good vs. Evil sense. Evil creatures (especially the non-humanoid kind) are irredeemably Evil. There is no fixing them.

If someone initiated Killing Combat on you and you refuse to enter Killing Combat in retaliation (there was no penalty for defending yourself by trying to kill someone trying to kill you) you actually gained a bonus to your HP. However, if you killed someone, you gained no HP for the adventure... you simply weren't considered heroic in your actions.<br/><br/>Now, later that was modified to allow GMs to set the genre of the game. Obviously guys like Vigilante and the Punisher could kill people and still gain HP, so you could tweak those controls based on the morality of your game setting.<br/><br/>It is an interesting approach, but if you really want players to look at different ways to handle combat and conflicts, I would look at giving them bonuses for not killing opponents as opposed to penalties for killing opponents, more of a carrot-than-stick approach. You can influence your players actiions to a degree simply by building those rewards into the game.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204518/#Comment_204518" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T13:11:36+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  1:11PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Mark, I don't really say this very often, but you might be better off with a different game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204523/#Comment_204523" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T13:33:56+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  1:33PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark,<br/><br/>Don't award XP for killing.

The vast majority of monsters are just that: monsters. They're not another kind of people, they're something that can't be reasoned with, can't be negotiated with, and wants things that are fundamentally inimical to civilization. In some cases, I refluff aggressively to get to that point - for example, my "orcs" are humans who have been corrupted with demon blood and turned into insane horrors. Killing them is a mercy.<br/><br/>2. For other cases, I just go with the general note concept that this is a world without the same attachment to due process, rights, and dignity as ours, in which an enemy left alive is a terrible liability. It's wrong to just march into a random kobold warren and start slaughtering, but 95% of the time, the only reason you'd do it is because you're at war, or there's a specific reason to do so. Random violence is unacceptable, but organized violence is pretty much par for the course for all but the most virtuous and civilized.

And if you can distance yourself from modern 21st-century morality and start with the premise that in D&amp;D, gods are actually real and communicate with people, then "My god said it was cool to kill these dudes and take their stuff" is more than a justification:  it's a holy mission to do exactly that!  I don't imagine that there's a lot of room for moral doubt in a world where gods really and truly tell their clerics what they want done in their name.  (Bonus points if the god of your enemies is one that says they ought to kill YOU and take YOUR stuff.  That's basically a holy war, right there.)<br/><br/><br/>Although honestly, nine times out of ten my solution was similar to Mark W's:  I stuck with pure-and-simple monsters and didn't fiddle around with villages full of goblin babies or kobolds who were willing to negotiate or any of that stuff.  I put the PCs up against things that HAD to be fought, that could ONLY be fought, because (and this may be a telling point) I had no intention of using D&amp;D to run a "serious" game.  Moral quandaries just didn't fit with our game's agenda...we wanted the PCs to fight evil and find treasure and do the whole old-school adventuring party shtick, we didn't want to dwell on scenes where the PCs angst out over what they ought to do with a captive gnoll or debate the morality of raiding ancient tombs.  (If we're going to play a game where issues like that are at the forefront, I'd just as soon do it where my modern day hippie liberal sensibilities are going to be less anachronistic, not to mention in a setting which I actually like...which rules most fantasy settings out.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204992/#Comment_204992" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-03T06:20:48+00:00" title="May  3, 2009  6:20AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2009 11:10AM by Eric Provost.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><strong><em>"Moral quandaries just didn't fit with our game's agenda..."</em></strong></p>\n<p>That may be the key issue right there.</p>\n<p>[edited to snip out useless material]</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205023/#Comment_205023" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-03T10:06:33+00:00" title="May  3, 2009 10:06AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2009 10:06AM by JDCorley.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For intelligent monsters, implementing morale rules of some kind helped soften things for my group when we had a bit of a problem with it once.

As others have mentioned, war is a good approach. It comes with a built-in justification as well as room for a moral quandary or two.<br/><br/>If the focus of the game is treasure hunting, then you might want to adjust the reward system. Such that PCs get experience for overcoming challenges. So the fights won't be about killing a roomful of monsters. Just getting past them. Whether the PCs hack-n-slash their way through, negotiate safe passage or just sneak around them is immaterial. I like this approach because it encourages the players to think about more than just combat and it forces me to give a reason for a combat to take place. So combat is never about just combat. There's some goal. This also happens to be something that enhances 4e in general.<br/><br/>In most of my games, monsters are monstrous. There is no negotiating with them. For example, kobolds are a monster race that has gotten a bit too cutesy over the years. But not my kobolds. My kobolds are a race of genestealing planar lice. If they catch you, they will not negotiate with you but hold you down while a "queen" injects hundreds of tennis ball sized eggs into you. You will be bound and paralyzed while these eggs incubate. Then you will die while they hatch from your body and eat you. But some of them will carry a bit of resemblance to you. Maybe your eyes or haircolor. Because, after all, you're their "parent" too.<br/><br/>Negotiate with that.<br/><br/>Goblins in my games are like the Picts in Hyperborea. They hunt you down. They eat you. They overrun human settlements. Because they eat humans.<br/><br/>My orcs are like either the monsters in Feast or the Reavers in Firefly. They won't talk to you. They won't be all cutesy or even qualify for henchmanship. They will either kill, rape, mutilate or burn you. Conveniently, I can use a 1d4 to determine which approach they take.<br/><br/>The only humanoid monster race I have an issue with currently are Hobgoblins. They're like Orcs. They're like Goblins. They're like Orc-Goblins. But not. I guess I just haven't hit on the right nastiness for them yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205158/#Comment_205158" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T09:13:02+00:00" title="May  4, 2009  9:13AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: smathis</cite>My kobolds are a race of genestealing planar lice.</blockquote>\nOMFG that is awesome.<br/><br/>Your post just made my brain explode.

It's just that I've only had this problem with murdering people in D&amp;D when the GM and the group in general have failed to make the effort to create an imaginative context for the action. This is especially a problem for me with 4th edition, which is so much of a boardgame that often nobody is trying to justify anything at all about the action: you're just supposed to run the dungeon crawl experience on automatic. This leaves me in a strange half-way point between a strategy game and a roleplaying game, a place in which my character apparently wants to kill lesser peoples of the earth just to steal their gold. The problem goes away if I just block off the fiction or actually usurp the GM's position and start laying out some real fiction with a real context for what the characters are doing.<br/><br/>So what I'm saying is that all these solutions based on the fictional context work swimmingly well if the group is capable of creating a fictional context in the first place. If they aren't, then you might get stuck in the place where all those WotC modules are created, which is a pretty awful place in my mind.

Namely, that you kill the monster THEN you take it's treasure.<br><br>4e helps with this in that there are treasure "parcels". And while I don't care much for the treasure system in general (and haven't since the mid-80s), treasure parcels do lend themselves nicely to tweaking when and how players get those sorts of rewards.<br><br>For instance, one parcel could be an objet d'arte found in a room of the dungeon. Like a statuette or a big gem of the sort that Conan might find. No looting of bodies here. Just an overlooked little bauble that somehow wound up in a dark corner of this dungeon thing. Another is setting up the treasure as a reward.<br><br>So the dungeon needs to be cleared out? Well, the duke offers the party treasure parcels 5,6 and 7 if they can do it. No looting the hobgoblins in this instance. Just a good ol' mercenary genocide.<br><br>I find it also helps to think of the threats in the terms represented in Storming the Wizard's Tower. Namely, that this dungeon or kobold infestation or goblin horde is somehow threatening the livelihood of the community. And the PCs are (usually) the only ones who can pull it off.<br/><br/>And, while I appreciate the desire to give the humanoid monsters their own societies, I don't really see the moral dilemma of genocide/murder in that sort of game as a problem. It's more of a feature. There's always the option to make the societies themselves monstrous. Just pick an ugly aspect of human society (historical or not) and turn it up to 11.<br/><br/>Instead of Orcs being mindless engines of destruction (as I tend to portray them), maybe they see themselves as the most perfect of the world's creations. And have therefore tasked themselves with wiping out the other races and interbreeding with the women of other races (at least those deemed worthy enough to carry the Orc blood) because all other races are a blight on creation, whatever that means for Orcs.<br/><br/>That's at least the seed of a monstrous society that will not negotiate and will lend itself to a built-in justification for war and such.<br/><br/>But if what you want is a game where you can negotiate with the monsters on a rational level. Then I think the moral dilemma of, say, slaying a schoolhouse of chirpy, kobold spawn is more something to be explored. So the PCs slaughter sentient races indiscriminately. Run with that. Use it. There have got to be repercussions or consequences. Even if it's just the Good Fairy coming down and turning them all into Goons. Because basically, despite their internal justifications, the party is playing an evil party.<br/><br/>I once put together a campaign where there was a tentative truce between the monsters and the humans. The humans were a new race to the world, having fled their last one. And they were vastly outnumbered in this strange new world. But some humans (often PCs) threatened to violate that truce. Elves, dwarves, etc., had their own agendas depending on whether or not they approved of the human interlopers.<br/><br/>But wiping out a den of Gnolls just because they were there? The PCs had better cover that one up or the monsters might come back and wipe the humans off the map. Of course, there were monsters who wanted that anyway and would try to frame humans for breaking the treaty...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205312/#Comment_205312" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T06:35:11+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  6:35AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2009 6:35AM by GB_Steve.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The D&amp;D justification is pretty much the same as the real world justification, i.e. dehumanisation.

In our upcoming 4e game, I'm playing a "Lawful" character, which I see as a huckster, a tent revivalist out to bilk the townsfolk for their GPs and find out where there are more under the mountain. I don't think it's <em>possible</em> to play a good character in D&amp;D. The definitions of morality in the system don't map to any moral understanding I have of the Universe and how the people in it treat each other.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205649/#Comment_205649" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T09:57:32+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  9:57AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a short-lived Planescape campaign, one of the PCs found a cursed weapon called The Martyr Blade.

Some of this ground has already been covered via the Grendel and Siegfried examples. <br><br>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frank Trollman</cite><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The Socialomicon: Heroes in the Greek Sense:</b></span><br><b>"Can I kill the baby kobolds?"</b><br><br/>When people are asked to name a historical point that D&amp;D most closely represents, they'll usually say something like "The Middle Ages", or perhaps a date between 1000 AD and 1500 in Europe. Truth be told, to find a historical period which has a social setup anything like D&amp;D, you're going to have to go back. Way back. D&amp;D represents a period in history that is most closely identifiable with the Iron Age: the landscape is dotted with tribes and aspiring empires, the wilderness is largely unexplored, and powerful individuals and small groups can take over an area without having a big geopolitical hubbub about it.<br/><br/>The source material for the social setting of D&amp;D is not Hans Christian Andersen, it's Homer's The Iliad and Caesar's The Gallic Wars. In the backdrop of early historical empire building, crimes that modern humans shake their heads at the barbarity of are common place \u2013 even among the heroes. D&amp;D at its core is about breaking into other peoples' homes, possibly killing the residents, and taking their stuff home with you in a sack. And in the context of the period, that is acceptable behavior for a hero.<br/><br/><b>Living With Yourself After a Raid</b><br/><br/>The goblins have gone and conducted a raid on your village in full force. They rode in, took a bunch of the sheep, killed some of the people, set fire to some of the cottages, and rode away again with Santa Sacks filled with this year's crop. And they laughed because they thought it was funny. And now that your elder brother has been slain you want to dedicate yourself to the eradication of the Goblin Menace and begin the training necessary to become a Ranger so that you can empty the goblin village from the other side of the valley once and for all.<br/><br/>Par for the course D&amp;D, right? Wrong! Killing all the goblins isn't just an Evil act, it's unthinkable to most D&amp;D inhabitants. This is the Classical Era, and actually sowing the fields of Carthage with salt is an atrocity of such magnitude that people will speak of it for thousands of years. In the D&amp;D world, goblins raid human settlements with raiding parties, humans raid goblin settlements with "adventuring parties", and like the cattle raiding culture of Scotland, it's simply accepted by all participants as a fact of life.<br/><br/>When your city is raided by other groups of humanoids, it's a bad thing for your city. Orcs may kidnap some of your relatives and use them as slaves (or food), and many of your fellow villagers may lose their lives defending lives and property important to them. But that's part of life in the age, and people just sort of expect that sort of thing.<br/><br/><b>Razing Hell: When Genocide is the Answer:</b><br/><br/>Sometimes in history there would come a great villain who just didn't get with the program. The Classical example is the Assyrians. Those bastards went around from city to city stacking heads in piles and levying 100% taxation and such to conquered foes. They became\u2026 unpopular, and eventually were destroyed as a people. That's the law of the jungle as far back as there are any records: if a group pushes things too far the rules of mercy and raiding simply stop applying. Goblins, orcs, sahuagin\u2026 these guys generally aren't going to cross that line. But if they do, it's OK for the gloves to come off. In fact, if some group of orcs decides to kill everyone in your village while you're out hunting so that you come home to find that you are the last survivor, other humanoids (even other Evil humanoids like gnolls) will sign up to exterminate the tribe that has crossed the line.<br/><br/>Cultural relativism goes pretty far in D&amp;D. Acceptable cultural practices include some pretty over-the-top practices such as slavery, cannibalism, and human sacrifice. But genocide is still right out. That being said, some creatures simply haven't gotten with the program, and they are kill-on-sight anywhere in the civilized world or in the tribes of savage humanoids. Mindflayers, Kuo-Toans, and [Monster] simply do not play the same game that everyone else is playing, mostly because their culture simply does not understand other races as having value. And that means that even other Evil races want to exterminate those peoples as a public service. Like the Assyrians, they've simply pushed their luck too far, and the local hobgoblin king will let you marry his daughter if you help wipe them out of an area.<br/><br/>Solitary intelligent monsters often get into the same boat as the Kuo-Toans. Since the Roper really has no society (and possibly the most obscure language in Core D&amp;D), it's very difficult for it to understand the possible ramifications of offending pan-humanoid society. So now they've done it, and they really haven't noticed the fallout they are receiving from that decision. Ropers pretty much attack anything they see, and now everyone that sees a roper attacks them. In the D&amp;D worlds, ropers are on the brink of extinction and it probably never even occurs to them that their heavy tendrilled dealings with the other races have pushed them to this state.</br></br></blockquote>\nFrom <a href="http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=28547" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=28547</a> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205914/#Comment_205914" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T06:29:45+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  6:29AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course, how bad the bad guys are strongly affects how much justification the good guys need. Again, there's been some coverage already in this thread.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frank Trollman and K.</cite><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Morality: How Black is the Night?</b></span><br/><br/>Those readers who have been following this series will remember the basic moral question regarding Necromancy: namely the fundamental decision for each game as to whether to treat Negative Energy as an objective force or an ultimate moral indictment. The central question surrounding fiends is less obvious, but in no way less important to your game. We know that a Gelugon is Evil, he's got a subtype that denotes him as being specifically Evil, that's not the question. What we don't know is how Evil he is. That's a central question that has to be addressed within the context of each game. Let's face it, a lot of people really aren't comfortable with villainy more pernicious than the antagonists in a Saturday morning cartoon. Other people have a different and equally valid hang-up: they aren't comfortable having their characters stab enemies in the face repeatedly until they bleed to death unless those enemies are extremely bad people. As so frequently happens, the rules for Dungeons and Dragons are written to accommodate both play styles, which in reality ends up including nothing. Perhaps unfortunately, you must come to a table-wide consensus about what your gaming is not doing before you can have your game do anything at all.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that none of these play styles are "worse" or "better".<br/><br/><b>Moral Option 1: A Worthy Opponent</b><br/>"Fools! You have interfered with my plans for the last time!"<br/><br/>For many games, the fact that the bad guys are bad is pretty much sufficient. Like the villains in Saturday Morning Cartoons, their villainy requires \u2013 and gets \u2013 no explanation. Actual villainy is fairly upsetting to contemplate, and a lot of people don't want to do it. I don't blame them, cannibalism, deliberate infliction of pain, and exploitation of the innocent are unpleasant. Talking about secret prisons where torture is conducted night and day without respite or reason is super depressing.<br/><br/>Implications: The biggest implication here is that since Evil and Good are basically just political parties or ethnic hats, it is perfectly OK to have mixed alignment parties or to ban mixed alignment parties. You're never going to have a serious discussion about what it is that Evil people do, so it's actually not important how you handle them. You can even switch how you're handling it in the middle for no reason. One day, the Atomic Skull can just chip in to save the world from Darkseid. Another day you can go kill the Atomic Skull without feeling bad. It's very liberating, because you can tell a lot of stories \u2013 so long as none of those stories involve actual evil actions happening on camera.<br/><br/>Pit Falls: While it is certainly a load off the mind to not be constantly reminded of child abuse, torture, and sexual misconduct, bear in mind that this is Dungeons and Dragons \u2013 your foes are more than likely going to be killed with extreme stabination. Possibly in the face. Possibly more than once. If the villains aren't doing anything overwhelmingly bad, it's entirely possible that it won't seem like they deserve being killed. If subjected to enough analysis, one might even find that your own "heroes" appear to be the villains in your cooperative storytelling adventure. Certainly, He-Man never took that sword and chopped Skeletor into chunks. Star Wars: Episode One was such an unsatisfying movie in no small part because the villains never did anything bad.<br/><br/>Glossing over the villainous activities of the bad guys should go hand in hand with all of the players acknowledging and understanding what you are doing and why you are doing it. As long as everyone is making the active and informed choice to not deal with the heavy moral questions \u2013 it's all good.</blockquote>\nFrom <a href="http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=28828" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=28828</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205915/#Comment_205915" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T06:30:15+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  6:30AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2009 6:30AM by Eric.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Continued from above.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frank Trollman and K.</cite><b>Moral Option 2: The Banality of Evil</b><br/>"It's 9 O'clock, time to get back to some Evil."<br/><br/>Many DMs will want to play their fiends pretty much like Nazis \u2013 their agenda is hateful, but in their off time they go hang out at the pub just like everyone else. You could even sit there with them and drink together unless you happen to be a Jew. This is the default assumption of a lot of Planescape literature, for example. An Evil creature is Evil because it ever does Evil things, not because it's necessarily doing any Evil right now. Darkness and light are, in this model, pretty ephemeral concepts \u2013 characters who wish to save their own sanity will end up either paying perhaps too much attention or ignoring them completely often as not.<br/><br/>Implications: Since bad guys (and presumably good guys as well) spend most of their time being regular guys and only infrequently perform acts worthy of praise or scorn, it's extremely easy for heroes to fall to Evil and extremely easy for villains to be redeemed for full value. People on both sides of the Good/Evil axis are doing pretty unexceptional stuff most of the time, so the allegiance that even Evil Clerics have to darkness is pretty tenuous.<br/><br/>This way of handling things is so much better at handling mysteries than are other morality systems that it may as well be a requirement if you ever want to play a "who-done-it" adventure. Since the good guys and bad guys spend most of their day being actually indistinguishable one from another, it makes distinguishing them actually difficult \u2013 and that has to happen if there is to be any question of who the PCs are supposed to stab.<br/><br/>Pit Falls: Be wary of over-humanizing the villains. In many stories, the bad guys are a lot more interesting than the white hats; and that can seriously derail a campaign if it happens in a role playing scenario. Beware also of the fact that if the Evil Overlord is mostly chillin like a villain with his family and having brews with his bros, it's going to be pretty hard to justify it when you inevitably stab him right in the face. Also remember that while The Banality of Evil is great for mysteries, it's actually so good for mysteries that the game can bog down. Players can get caught up in the minor goings-on of characters you don't even care about. Paranoia can be paralyzing when any scullery maid could really just go Evil at any time and poison your food to try to get your wallet. It can be realistic, but realism takes place in real time. That's not good if you're trying to raise hippogriffs as steeds.</blockquote>\nFrom <a href="http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=28828" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=28828</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205917/#Comment_205917" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T06:31:48+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  6:31AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Continued from above.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frank Trollman and K.</cite><b>Moral Option 3: The Face of Horror.</b><br/>"I think I have Evil sand. In my pants."<br/><br/>Many DMs will want to make their Evil as Evil as possible. That can get\u2026 pretty Evil. It can actually get so Evil that people who overhear you playing the game will get a very bad impression about your group and the things you talk about. The starker the contrast between Good and Evil, the more righteous the acts of heroism the players commit. Tales of monstrous action are fascinating and the horrid and disgusting can hold people's interest indefinitely. By having the forces of Evil disembowel people in loving detail you can capture the imaginations of your players with actually relatively little creative work on the part of the DM. There have been over 10 Jason movies because those things practically write themselves, and people keep watching them because they genuinely are as intriguing as the are revolting.<br/><br/>Implications: With the forces of Evil running around doing actual stomach churning crime, having Evil and Good "team up" is essentially implausible. In fact, having Good and Evil characters in the same party is pretty much a non-starter. When playing with The Face of Horror the universe is essentially a cosmic battle between Good and Evil, the forces of Law and Chaos have some fights too, but essentially that's just crime compared to the world shaking conflict of darkness and light.<br/><br/>Further, while Good and Evil being as immiscible as Rubidium and Water makes for a well defined party demographic, it also has other far reaching consequences. When you go to the Abyss, the sand itself is Evil. Once you've made the determination that this means more than that Paladins can find every grain \u2013 you've bought yourself into the determination that beaches in the Abyss are themselves morally reprobate somehow.<br/><br/>Pit Falls: While The Face of Horror ends up making Good and Evil a much more important distinction than Law vs. Chaos, that's not really a problem. Sure, it's not reciprocal or equivalent and that's a breach of the Great Wheel tirade, but that's not really important to the game. Let's face it, when was the last time you saw a statted up enemy prepared to cast dictum? No, the problem is that if you make Evil as nasty as it can be made, it's really nasty. It makes other people in the game uncomfortable, and it disturbs people who hear portions of your game out of context. People like talking about stabbing their sword into an evil monster, that's all heroic and crap, but actually looking at sword wounds is icky. People don't want to do it.<br/><br/>Evil, if defined as "things we don't like", is pretty much exclusively composed of things we don't like. That means that the more we focus our attention on the details of what's going on, the more we'll want to clean our eyes out with soap. And while skirting that line can make a story grimly compelling, remember always that different people have different tolerances for this sort of thing. Just because something is gross enough to catch your prurient interest without wrecking your lunch doesn't mean that it isn't so nasty as to drive other people away. Tolerance for discussing child murder in the context of a story is not a virtue, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with the people who don't enjoy watching movies in the splatter horror genre.</blockquote>\nFrom <a href="http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=28828" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=28828</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205919/#Comment_205919" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T06:33:23+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  6:33AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finishing up this bit.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frank Trollman and K.</cite><b>Moral Option 4: Perfection in Balance</b><br/>What use is the light that casts not a shadow?"<br/><br/>In this model, evil is a force that sits diametrically opposed to good. In order for one to exist, the other must exist as well. Evil is what gives good its meaning, and in fact one can simply define one by the other: to be good is not-evil, and to be evil is to be not-good. When playing with this option, evil plays a vital role in society and cannot be eliminated without dire consequences. For example, when the Jedi eliminate the Sith Lords, they set themselves up for an even more powerful Sith Lord to rise and kill them all, ushering in a new order of Evil, which is in turn later demolished by the calling out of a powerful Jedi who can defeat it. Neutrality is the rule of the day in this model, in the sense that evil and good will always be in the midst of trumping each other in an effort to \u201cwin\u201d, a goal that is as meaningless as it is impossible.<br/><br/>What does that mean for your game? In this model, evil will always be the fly in your ointment and the piss in your cheerios, and good will always be the silver lining in the stormcloud and the complementary bag of nuts in your red-eye flight. Even the most powerful and good organization of clerics in your world will have a cruel inquisitor, and even the most death-hungry cabal of necromancers will have a guy who is kind to puppies and little children. Organizations and people will be \u201cmostly\u201d one thing or the other, but not all of anything, and people will be OK with that. Kind kings will be mostly good, but will have no problem massacring an entire generation of goblinkind in an effort to keep the roads safe, and liches who eat souls will defend the land from rampaging chimera without reward in an effort to keep the peace.<br/><br/>Implications: In a sense, this is the easiest of moral options, as you won\u2019t need to really keep track of what\u2019s going on with alignments. People will occasionally do things out of character, and that\u2019s fine. Society will be quite tolerant, as they completely think its OK for there to be a Temple Street with a shrine for Orcus worshippers competing for space with a hospital sponsored by the clergy of Pelor. When one organization for good or evil gets stomped down, another one will pop up to replace it in an endless game of cosmic whack-a-mole.<br/><br/>For character with alignment related class features, atonement is a far easier process. Occasional deeds that violate your alignment are tolerated, as long as attempts at acts of atonement are made in a reasonable time frame. The Paladin that kills an innocent to defeat a powerful demon may have to visit the innocent\u2019s family and make restitution after the battle, and the Cleric of Murder who defends the king from an assassin may have to seek out several of the King\u2019s loved one\u2019s in order to rededicate himself to his dark god.<br/><br/>Pit Falls: It can be pretty cool to have a party that has an assassin, a druid, and a champion of light in it \u2013 there's a lot of early D&amp;D that has that as virtually the iconic party \u2013 but if the great game between Good and Evil is an inherently pointless game, that can make the story of your characters seem pretty banal. It's a line that can be hard to walk. It's just plain difficult to simultaneously have any individual attempt to destroy the world be important while having it be built into the contract that there will be another one tomorrow.</blockquote>\nFrom <a href="http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=28828" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=28828</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[4E D&amp;D] Justifying Murder - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9239/4e-d-d-justifying-murder/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[4E D&amp;amp;D] Justifying Murder - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9239/4e-d-d-justifying-murder/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: Joshua A.C.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Logos, the thing is, you're making a<em>lifestyle</em>out of being around when the girl gets eaten. After a while, you're going to be like Jessica Fletcher: why does all this murder happen around<em>me</em>?</blockquote>\nI always had a theory about the <i>Murder, She Wrote</i> lady...<br/><br/>Anyways, again, context can help here. The way I've rationalized D&amp;D adventurers (and magic items, btw) is that when a monster is killed some of that essence of wrong is transferred to the slayer. That's how my grandfather's longsword becomes a Holy Avenger.<br/><br/>And that's how my character, as an adventurer, reaches a liminal point in society.<br/><br/>So, Joe PC is a farmboy. But then a goblin steals his little sister. So Joe PC pleads with the townsfolk to do something. But they won't. Because everyone already knows that it's already too late and that going into the cave where the goblins are holed up is suicide. One old-timer, who fought the goblins like 40 years ago, recognizes that the goblins will become a growing threat to the community and agrees to go with Joe PC. They head out to the goblin warren and kill every last one of them.<br/><br/>But Joe comes back different. He's no longer Joe the farmboy. People view him as a hero (somewhat) and also something else. Think about how Vietnam Vets got treated when they got home. Or gunslingers in the Old West (even the "good" ones).<br/><br/>Something's different about Joe now. And he's embarked on a path that has permanently forked him off the traditional farmboy lifepath.<br/><br/>Some would say he's cursed. Some would say he's a witch. Or maybe a warlock. Everyone would rather him leave. But when the **** hits the fan, they'll come get him. Because they have no one else to turn to.<br/><br/>So, making a career out of slaying things definitely has its drawbacks. But I don't pester players with the bleeding-heart moral dilemma of<br/>"these kobolds have families" sort of thing. I think that's cheap. And as a DM, I think it's inappropriate to force one's moral judgments on to your group.<br/><br/>I'm not there to teach players life-lessons. Especially over a game that's built fundamentally around killing monsters. Which constitutes, oh about, 80% of all RPGs written, I'd guess.<br/><br/>Think about it. The reward structure is established around killing things. No different than a lot of games out there. But you want your players to feel <i>bad</i> about it? That's like making a cyberpunk party feel bad about stealing data.<br/><br/>For my own moral health, I do (and have) implemented features of the D&amp;D setting that helps me feel a little better about it all. That's what I'm putting here. Mainly because if I run default D&amp;D I never cease to be amazed at a group's capacity for evil. So, recognizing that D&amp;D parties are, say, gunmetal grey on the morality spectrum, I make the world near-black. So that way they can look bright and justified. And they get to do what they want and come across as heroes more often than not.<br/><br/>My personal dilemma is much worse than this. Not to threadjack, but I often have a serious problem portraying the opposition in these games. I mean, getting into the groove of a truly brutal setting takes me into very unsettling mindscapes from time-to-time. Like I'm sitting there watching some brutal report on MSNBC or Frontline about Rwandan genocide or modern-day slavery in Eastern Europe and I'm like "Huh. That might work for Hobgoblins..." And then I'm like, "OMG! Why do I think that?"<br/><br/>When you stare into the abyss, I suppose. Beyond that, I think Logos hits it spot on...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><br/>It honestly surprises me that considering  western society has produced so many moral philosophies that are the equivalent of 'life is nasty, brutish and short' that it is utterly alien to some people that murder happens over the most plebeian of reasons, let alone involving monsters themselves.</blockquote>\nAn evening with the History Channel should give you all the fodder you need to establish an enemy deserving of being slain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205948/#Comment_205948" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T07:14:11+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  7:14AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: smathis</cite>My personal dilemma is much worse than this.

More copypasta:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frank Trollman and K.</cite><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bringing the World out of the Dark Ages</b></span><br/><br/>It is historical fact that you can take a ridiculous and crumbling imperium with serfs and horse-drawn carts managed by a tyrannical and squabbling aristocracy and boot strap it into being a technologically sophisticated global power that can win the space race and such in a single generation even while being invaded by an evil and genocidal empire. The people at the top don't even need to be nice <i>or sane</i>, they just have to understand that economics is an entirely voodoo science, and the limits of production can be broken by thousands of percentage points by getting everyone to buy on credit, work on projects that people looking at the big picture tell them to work on, continuously invest in productive capital, and believe in the future.<br/><br/>Right. That's called Communism, and it ends the dark ages immediately even if it isn't run well. Presumably if it was being run by Paladins who actually <i>radiate goodness</i> and Wizards who are inhumanly intelligent and can cast powerful divinations to determine projected needs and goods could be distributed to the masses with teleportals \u2013 it would work substantially better. That sort of thing is not outside the capabilities of your characters in D&amp;D. It's not outside the capabilities of the people in the village your characters are saving from gnollish invasion. It's not even technically complicated. But it isn't done.<br/><br/>Partly it isn't done because we're playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, not Logistics &amp; Dragons. While it is true that you can fix the world's ills in a much more tangible fashion by industrializing the production of grain and arranging a non-gold based distribution system such that staple food stuffs are available to all, thereby freeing up potential productive labor for use in blah blah blah\u2026 the fact is that to a very real degree we play this game because telling stories about slaying evil necromancers and swinging on chandeliers is <i>awesome</i>. But the other reason is that the society in D&amp;D really isn't ready for a modern or futuristic social setup. Noone is going to understand how they are supposed to interact with Socialism, Capitalism, or Fascism, things are Feudal and people <i>understand</i> that. Wealth is exchanged for goods and services on the grounds that people on both sides of the exchange aren't sure that they would win the resulting combat if they tried to take the goods or wealth by force of arms.<br/><br/>Rome had steam engines. Actual difference engines that propelled a metal device with the power of a combustion reaction through the medium of the expansion of heated water. Really. They never built rail roads because slaves were cheaper than donkeys and the concept of investing in labor saving devices was preposterous. In D&amp;D, the idea of having an economy based around trust in the government and labor/wealth equivalencies is similarly preposterous. It's not that the idea wouldn't work, it's that every man, woman, and child in society would simply laugh you out of the room if you tried to explain it to them.</blockquote>\nFrom <a href="http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=28547" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=28547</a><br/><br/>So, basically, that guy who taught you to set things on fire with your mind certain could try to funnel your activities to useful social good. But, that's not how society works here. It's kind of like graduate school, where professors try to develop students so those students can go out and do stuff and increase the professor's reputation by association, as opposed to bettering the world. Your mentor might try to use use to advance their agenda, whatever that happens to be, but it's going to be <i>their</i> agenda or <i>theirs team's</i> agenda even if they happen to be a paladin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206029/#Comment_206029" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T09:38:35+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  9:38AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2009 9:52AM by Guy Srinivasan.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AP from yesterday:<br/>\nE: "Nonlethal!

I picture adventurer's in that context as old gunslingers who had to hang up their guns. I can't recall a movie of such offhand but I do remember it as a trope of many westerns. Or maybe like Viggo Mortensen in <i>A History of Violence</i>.<br/><br/>It's always nice to have a player portraying a veteran of this sort in the game. It sets up a real dichotomy between the younger PCs and the vet, only the vet is 1st level because he's just out of practice.<br/><br/>Of course, then there's the cycle of the world slowly evolving to where the PCs aren't needed to "slay monsters" anymore. Some adventurers become bandits. Others fight on the side of the emerging power structure. But none of them can escape their past. It's all very Old West in the early 1900s (think <i>The Wild Bunch</i>) or the Caribbean during the decline of piracy.<br/><br/>So, all the monster-slaying can be front-loaded. While the really heavy issues facing Monster-Slayers/Adventurers/Witchers wait in the wings.

And from a dramatic storytelling point of view, the periods before the war and after the war can honestly be just as awesome as the war itself. Periods before war are, frankly, just like periods of peace and don't warrant being included in <i>this</i> text at all. Periods after wars can be quite compelling as well.<br/><br/>It is a common myth that all wars have winners and losers. The truth is that there are many wars that don't have any winners. Nevertheless we will classify the afterwar campaigns by the signature winner or loser of the last conflict. Often a war will have many winners and losers, so really this can be thought of us a jumping off point for the people the story is most interested in.<br/><br/><b>Triumph of the Halflings: Reconstructing the Shire</b><br/><br/>How many of you actually read the Lord of the Rings rather than simply watching the movies? Perhaps the biggest and most awesome part of Halfling lore is the part where they have to pick up the pieces after their shire has been razed. So here you have a situation where the halflings have won, they have conquered and they can invoke their rights as conquerors to impose their culture on the defeated.<br/><br/>But that's a problem. Halfling culture is all about not doing that, it's a very nice society that produces a lot of grain and leads by example. Halfling society has Mayors who rule because they are well liked and have good ideas \u2013 not necessarily the strongest adventurers. The entire point of the "Outrider" culture is in fact to get powerful Halflings into a prestigious position where they don't control the day-to-day workings of society.<br/><br/>When the Halflings become conquerors, their whole way of life is disrupted. Suddenly the Outriders do run the show \u2013 or at least those parts of it as are on Goblin land. Remember, absolute power corrupts and all that. Halfling society has never really had to contend with a leader who wasn't easily replaceable. With the masters of war in control, how can the shire ever be rebuilt the way the people want it to be? And when it comes down to it, should the Shire be rebuilt the old way? The last time around, The War happened, and that wasn't good for anyone. Maybe a new direction is the best thing.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206317/#Comment_206317" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T11:33:29+00:00" title="May  8, 2009 11:33AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><b>The Wire</b><br/><br/>Oh, Nick jogged my memory.<br/><br/>Remember a while back, when I talked about my "The Wire" hack for 4E?  We just heavily leaned on that much-forgotten rule that you can choose to incapacitate, rather than kill, an opponent when you reduce them to zero hit points or less. The D&amp;D detectives and cops "incapacitated" (read: slammed up against walls and shackled) a lot of perps that way, and if they killed anyone at all, it was purposeful (at least at the metagame, story-telling level).</blockquote>\nThis is how we do it in my game, where the PCs are detectives in the city watch.  The default is "incapacitation" unless they specify otherwise -- which has become important, because they're likely to specify "kill" every time they deal with the halfling mafia now.  The nice thing about framing this as "killing is a big deal in a city game, so we're not just going to do it as default" means the players aren't going to "accidentally" kill someone.  So, each murder will have an individual, in-character justification (and I may make dumping the bodies in the sewers cleaned by gelatinous cubes without getting caught a skill challenge).<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9239/4e-d-d-justifying-murder" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9239/4e-d-d-justifying-murder" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9239/4e-d-d-justifying-murder/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F9239%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F9239%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
