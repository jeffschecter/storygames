But it's just so cool I had to share.<br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/500894669/serpents-tongue-a-new-magick-experience" rel="nofollow">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/500894669/serpents-tongue-a-new-magick-experience</a><br/><br/>A few bits from their page to say it better than I could:<br/><br/>"Become a Magi, by actually learning your incantations in the language of Serpent's Tongue, then casting them out of hardbound Codex's in fast 1-8 player Competitive battles and story-driven Cooperative campaigns. Find out more gameplay concepts at BecomeMagi.com."<br/><br/>"The hardbound faux-leather Codex represents the heart of the game, as it holds your Incantations, the cipher to cast them and provides the lore, secrets, maps and methodology used in the Cooperative Campaigns."<br/><br/>Ultimately I'd still really love to see something with the physical bits and some of the mechanical game structure this has, yet layered into a story creation game where the players are the one coming up with the fiction.  But this looks like it could be damn fun, too!  Yep, I'll feel silly muttering made up words, but I've always had a soft spot for what I call "kinetic" games that add arbitrary physiological elements to a game to add another dimension of challenge.  As an example, I like Punch Out for the Wii much more than the original on NES because the same cerebral aspects of the game are present, yet I also have to learn to move my body just right to really master it.<br/><br/>At one point I had started work on a role-playing game where you sing, draw/paint, mime or sculpt in order for your characters to manifest creative miracles into the fiction world.  I decided not to finish it though.<br/><br/>Cheers                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
