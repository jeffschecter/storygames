I'm so tired of The Chosen One in fantasy.  But I see it so much because it sells so well.<br/><br/>Now, I would say that Gene Wolfe's series The Wizard Knight uses The Chosen One in a way that did the opposite of make the story drek and drivel.  But he was using it almost in contrast to how it is normally used.  Just because Abel was The Chosen One didn't necessarily mean he had the best motives or made the right choices.  It just meant he was so powerful it was almost preordained he would crush anyone who opposed him.  Kinda like Dogs in the Vineyard.  ...But however awesome his story might be, I'm not sure how well it actually sold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87566/#Comment_87566" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T20:16:34+00:00" title="August 11, 2007  8:16PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Chosen One is just a tool in a toolbox.<br/><br/>Sometimes I use it.<br/><br/>Sometimes I use it ironically or deconstructively.<br/><br/>Sometimes I don't use it.<br/><br/>It depends on what I'm after.<br/><br/>One of my favorite fanfics ever (still unfinished, alas) includes an <i>incorrectly identified</i> Chosen One.

The Chosen One may have bad things happen to them, but only along the path to success.  Buffy can get beaten up and mope around all she wants, provided that she eventually gets her shit together and kicks some vampire ass.  Luke can get his hand chopped off and find out that he nearly got it on with his sister, because in the end he's going to overthrow the Empire.  Peter Parker gets crapped on by the entire universe on a daily basis, but always lives up to his great responsibility and defeats the supervillain.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what makes you The Chosen One is not just that fate is screwing with you, but that you will be triumphant in a way that makes the audience say "Fuck yeah, you just saved the day!"  And really, that's not Baltar.  As perennially screwed by fate as he is, he's not marked out to be the hero in the end.  The best he can hope for is a pyrrhic sacrifice that gives an actual Chosen One the opportunity to win.<br/><br/>Edit to add that I don't think The Chosen One and the "Newbie Protagonist" are necessarily the same thing.  TV shows definitely love to have a Newbie Protagonist, because the conventional wisdom is that audiences will need to have elements of the setting explained to them and it's easier/more comforting if that explanation is given in-character to someone they can identify with.  The Chosen One is a person of destiny, the special snowflake who has the mojo no one else has and will ultimately win where anyone else would lose.  You can combine those roles into a single character (and many shows do), but they're not the same at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87587/#Comment_87587" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T01:12:56+00:00" title="August 12, 2007  1:12AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, I kind of figured Baltar wouldn't count, too.<br/><br/>I asked the question because I'm trying to separate the "Chosen One" thing from broader ideas like "Make cool stuff happen" or "Stories are about <em>people</em>."

Having a 'point of view' character that allows the audience to have a window into the fiction is a perfectly valid strategy.  In fact, nothing gets made in Hollywood without one of these to some extent.  However, the lame-ass cop-out is when you make the newbie protagonist also the chosen one -- because then you're saying to the audience, "Hey, this guy who's a clueless fuck just like you?  He's actually totally awesome.  Don't you feel all warm and happy inside, knowing that you can be a clueless fuck and still be totally awesome?"<br/><br/>For a rather good example of clueless newbies that aren't chosen ones, check out the hobbits that <em>aren't</em> Frodo in <em>LotR</em>.  They all have wide-eyed adventures and make big, significant decisions, they're hella compelling, but they don't save the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87671/#Comment_87671" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T14:14:09+00:00" title="August 12, 2007  2:14PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a really well-done Chosen One story, which isn't just derivative though it recycles a lot of standard tropes, try David Zindell's Ea Cycle (starting with <i>The Lightstone</i>). He spends a whole (thick) book on the question of whether the viewpoint character is or is not the Chosen One, and does it really well. Credit to Mike Sands for putting me on to these.<br/><br/>Having said that, yes, the Chosen One is almost - but only almost - as tired (and as likely to put me off a story) as the Dark Lord. We get them both, ultimately, from Zoroastrianism via Judaism and Christianity, so they've been around a really long time. This, in turn, means that it's hard to do anything new with them. Whenever I pick up a book and read the blurb and it tells me that an unlikely Chosen One must battle the Dark Lord to prevent a terrible fate befalling... I put it back.<br/><br/>(I didn't think much of the Wizard Knight, by the way, but I can't stand Gene Wolfe generally. It's a personal taste thing, obviously, because some people I really respect, like Neil Gaiman, think he's great.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87686/#Comment_87686" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T19:03:09+00:00" title="August 12, 2007  7:03PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And in the article, she's not saying that the Chosen One is the best literary device and should be in all books and tv shows ever.  She admits that much of the appeal of shows like Firefly and Battlestar is that they <i>don't</i> use this trope.  She's saying that the Chosen One is a very <i>popular</i> cliche, and as such, it makes for popular media.  Whether or not you agree that making things that will be popular is a good goal to put over making things that are good, I think it's pretty solid advice that a good way to sell sci-fi and fantasy is to tie it to something well known and popular, like a Chosen One narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87692/#Comment_87692" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T19:53:13+00:00" title="August 12, 2007  7:53PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, she's pretty much saying (albeit in a very short article, so without the usual disclaimers and exceptions) that without using this particular trope your sci-fi/fantasy, however good, will not be popular.

Considering the fact that one of the many common themes about living in the modern world is its homogeneity, people like the idea of vicariously living through some schmuck who, through no fault of his own, Becomes Someone Special, Nay, Heroic.<br/><br/>So, yeah, apparently Heroes Journeys or Chosen One Tales are popular with the public -- but, you know, just because a work actually uses the trope doesn't mean it's any <em>good</em>. Sure, Harry Potter has a host of problems that detract from its quality -- but it's pretty good, or, maybe, you know Good Enough For Those Plebeian Bastards. <br/><br/>It's overused? Certainly. But so what? When you get down to it the reason why you stick to a good piece of work is because it's <em>good</em>, not because it's not <em>clich\xe9</em>. If it's good and it sells, excellent. If it's good (oh, and of course there are so many ways to define what is 'good') and it doesn't?

Small Wonder, Mork from Ork, and ALF had<br/>robot and alien family members, but remained family sitcoms, never gee whiz escapist technobabble.<br/><br/>Which would suggest that the real key to getting fanciful stuff on TV-- is to not rub the audience's nose<br/>in their ignorance of intergalactic propulsion or mythological beastiaries.<br/><br/>Is The Chosen One =really= a magic spice that renders niche tastes broadly palatble?<br/>Here's your answer: Wesley Crusher.   Boy he sure gave Star Trek mainstream appeal, didn't he!<br/><br/>Still The Chosen One will serve the author well in pitching to network development execs.<br/>First of all, it's a catchy buzzword.  Also, it's a dumbed down version of The Heroes' Journey,<br/>which has been a fad among Hollywood's no-nothing middle management for a couple decades now.<br/>So she won't be threatening -their- ignorance with her pitch.   <br/><br/>Also, there's a huuuuge sappy soft spot among guys like George Lucas and Spielberg and Tom Hanks--- for schmaltz about<br/>boys who go on magical journeys of vague wisdom and self-discovery-- and bond with their dads and crap.<br/>TV execs probably have the same nostalgic soft spot.   Jane asserts that it's the broad audience that<br/>loves The Chosen One.  I am not convinced.  But who cares?

Except it wasn't Wesley Crusher - he wasn't anywhere near a main character (wasn't even in every episode), and his more blatant Chosen One story didn't even come up until a few seasons in.<br/><br/>The Enterprise and its officers, however, were the chosen ones.  They were the ones who had the solutions for every major problem that faced the Galaxy, particularly with Picard's leadership.  Chosen One doesn't have to mean becoming one with the temporal plane, and sometimes it doesn't even need to be a specific character. They just need to be identifiable and familiar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87917/#Comment_87917" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-13T17:22:23+00:00" title="August 13, 2007  5:22PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>The Enterprise and its officers, however, were the chosen ones.</blockquote>I'm getting this impression that you're talking about a different kind of "chosen ones" here, because to my knowledge, <acronym title="Star Trek: the Next Generation">ST:TNG</acronym> never really had the classical Chosen One story structure\u2009\u2014\u2009its focus was on the crew, not a single individual character and their supporting characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87986/#Comment_87986" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T07:23:20+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  7:23AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate the Chosen One trope so much. The reason I hate it is that it makes so many of the peripheral characters look like worthless chumps. Oftentimes, as stated, The Chosen One is just a schmucky everyman arbitrarily thrust into a position of greatness. They start out as being weak and under the protection of some secondary mentor characters that have obviously striven to become competent, but soon outdistance this mentor in power, usually with the most minimal of effort. I'm thinking of characters like Morpheus in The Matrix, or Obi-Wan Kenobi. The mentor characters soon end up becoming sacrificial lambs to pull the heartstrings of the protagonist, despite the fact that the mentors usually have more character and more interesting drives and histories than the cipher that is the Chosen One. For me it's a weird paradox. Main characters in stories, especially if there's just one central protagonist, are almost always the ones I find most dull.<br/><br/>And in Star Trek, it wasn't the crew that were The Chosen Ones so much as it was humanity. Star Trek was all about making those other alien races look bad for their craaaazy cultures, and having the crew show them how much better humanity did it. Those silly Vulcans with their obsession with logic! Don't they know that it's important to be in touch with their feelings, like us humans? Those crazy aliens with asses growing from their foreheads, and the way they mandate the killing of their old people! They should cherish the elderly for their wisdom, just like us humans, amirite? Hooray for humanity! That's why most of the aliens that were part of the central cast needed to either be half-human or raised by humans, otherwise they'd just be lost souls, I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87998/#Comment_87998" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T08:22:26+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  8:22AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, what I'm really getting out of Ms. Espenson's commentary is simply that there has to be a genuinely interesting story, with characters the audience will give a crap about, at the core of all the fantasy/SF trappings.
