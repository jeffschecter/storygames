And a good way of deciding where to put in paths <a href="http://www.copenhagenize.com/2011/08/desire-line-made-permanent.html" rel="nofollow">is to look for the desire lines, them make them official</a>.  On the other hand trying to block them <a href="http://departmentfortransport.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/give-the-people-what-they-want-i-e-a-path/" rel="nofollow">can get ridiculous</a>.<br/><br/>One of the reasons behind D&amp;D's success, I'm convinced, is that it was designed pretty much this way.  Gygax didn't come up with the basic structure (Arneson did), and Gygax was not, to be honest, much of a designer (for evidence I submit <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/classic/rev_5496.phtml" rel="nofollow">Dangerous Journeys: Mythus</a> and <a href="http://www.criticalmiss.com/issue3/worst1.html" rel="nofollow">Cyborg Commando</a>).  But Gygax playtested the hell out of oD&amp;D for years, adapting and growing it based on the desire paths that people created (Mike Mornard summarises the whole process as "We made up some shit we thought would be fun").  In fact I don't think there's been one RPG that's been playtested nearly as well as oD&amp;D in history.  And that put a whole lot of depth into the game (including, for example, the narrative arc of characters that later inspired <a href="http://www.autarch.co/" rel="nofollow">Adventurer Conqueror King</a>, and such a narrative arc built into the rules was barely seen again in a published RPG until My Life With Master triggered the invention of the term Story Game).<br/><br/>On the flipside this, I think, was the mistake 4E made with AEDU (and just about all over tbh).  4e is, at a theoretical level, a fine game and At Will/Signature Move/Once per Episode is fine narrative pacing, but no one was walking that way.  So it had ... issues.<br/><br/>And I was also thinking how to apply this to game design, and realised that a lot of my favourite RPGs did.  To me the obvious one is Apocalypse World; the desire lines there are the rhythm of freeform RP, which is a big part of what makes it feel natural.  It also has genuine character (as opposed to numerical power) development built in and tools to match what people do.  Thinking a little deeper I realised that two of my other favourite RPGs also follow different sets of Desire Lines; Monsterhearts (as well as being Powered by the Apocalypse) uses a graduate level deconstruction of its genre that then goes on to use the deconstruction to show what the story pieces are and how to use them.  (This was, of course the same thing that made My Life With Master so revolutionary - and I need to get round to playing that sometime).  The other game that springs to mind as following Desire Lines is Fiasco which started, I think, with a standard theoretical five act structure borrowed from literary theory, but due to playtesting made the final act not quite vestigial (and it's now arguably three acts).<br/><br/>Am I onto something?  And if so where are the other desire lines for building shared fiction; the ones we aren't using?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433472/#Comment_433472" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T17:58:49+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  5:58PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really interesting observation about D&amp;D!

The look of AW may be trad, but the decision as to when to roll is quite purposely matched to when the handover in narration in freeform RP (and especially conflict resolution like Rock/Paper/Scissors) would happen. So it's a trad RPG (laid paths) with the paths deliberately built where freeform RPers would walk (the moves being used only where there are handovers or things like rock/paper/scissors in freeform).  And therefore causes as little disruption to freeform as is possible because the parts where you tangle with the rules are where freeform would be disrupted anyway.<br/><br/>This, incidentally, is why I consider DW (and a lot of the other hacks) to have missed the target.  They miss this aspect and e.g. start including questions that you wouldn't directly ask in freeform ("What happened here recently?")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433502/#Comment_433502" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-06T07:40:48+00:00" title="June  6, 2014  7:40AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's that saying...put ten scholars in a room with the Torah, and get eleven opinions? <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>This topic reminds me, not of the concept of the Fruitful Void, but of <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/119" rel="nofollow">Vincent Baker's seminal post</a> on the topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433504/#Comment_433504" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-06T08:12:13+00:00" title="June  6, 2014  8:12AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.

So starting with a solid mechanical core as a starting point, and <i>then</i> following desire lines might be good for fleshing out a design.  <br/><br/>If you start from freeform, though, and observe "this seems to be what people want to do", I'm not sure what you do with that information.  I believe some designers' response is "what you do is stay out of the way until there's a problem", with such problems either being player-to-player (you and I can't just agree on what happens) or group-to-fiction (we can agree, but what we agree on winds up being weak).  The desire lines are implicit in that recurring problems also signal recurring interests, but the desire lines aren't the focus in and of themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433553/#Comment_433553" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-08T00:39:00+00:00" title="June  8, 2014 12:39AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you think fruitful void is interesting, <a href="http://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/07/13/level-5-mechanics-and-dynamics/" rel="nofollow">emergence</a> is the same thing if you want to read more about it.

I think emergent design (I'm definitely familiar with the concept) differs in this sense: it's very open-ended.<br/> When you design an emergent game, it's more like giving the players a toolbox of stuff to make fun things with. Minecraft would be a great example of an emergent game, for instance. It's not really directed per se; you just have a bunch of components that only interact with one another in specific ways, but there's enough flexibility that the players can use those components to create their own things, things that you didn't anticipate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433554/#Comment_433554" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-08T03:12:53+00:00" title="June  8, 2014  3:12AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2014 3:14AM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>If you think fruitful void is interesting, <a href="http://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/07/13/level-5-mechanics-and-dynamics/" rel="nofollow">emergence</a> is the same thing if you want to read more about it.

Like dribbling in basketball. The game rules says that you must pass the ball if you want to move, but nothing says that you can't pass to yourself. But emergence do also cover unsuspected results in a certain area, like activities where bacterias grow. You know that bacterias are going to grow, but you don't know how. Both fruitful void and emergence are created through the interaction of different elements; it's just explained differently as the simple example with only two elements below shows.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/fruitfulEmergence.png"/><br/>Fruitful void is what happens between the interaction of two rules in the example. Emergence is the result of the interaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433564/#Comment_433564" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-08T11:29:03+00:00" title="June  8, 2014 11:29AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think fruitful void is very heavy with intentionality. You're giving the players most of the picture and letting them fill in the rest, knowing that it's going to be filled in a particular way, but they'll bring their own individuality into it. Emergence is when you don't have an intention beyond "I'm going to give you these things; I want to see what you make of them!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433591/#Comment_433591" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-09T11:20:28+00:00" title="June  9, 2014 11:20AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2014 11:21AM by Paul88.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This all sounds a bit familiar "<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19410/possibility-vs-probability-in-action/p1" rel="nofollow">possibility-vs-probability-in-action</a>"<br/>The paths of a game are all set out with probability but someone always wants to cut across the grass! <br/>What desires people to do that ? what could possibly be going through their minds!<br/>Maybe the chance of not being caught, <b>chance</b> <br/> <br/>In brief:<br/>\u2022\tChance is an everyday word used in a situation where we are talking about an event taking place whereas probability is a precise measurement of that chance<br/>\u2022\tProbability is a special branch of mathematics that helps people decide the percentage of likelihood of an event taking place whereas chances of an event taking place in daily life are merely opinions.<br/><br/>One desire line I feel is between opinions and chance or narration moving away from probability.<br/><br/>Not saying this good and better just possibly unexceptable like cutting across the grass. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
