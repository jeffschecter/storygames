For each die resulting in 1-3, one unit of Resource X is available for purchase. Each die resulting in 4-6 is how much one unit of Resource X costs.<br/><br/>Example: If you rolled 5 dice and you got 1, 4, 3, 6, 2. That means there are three bananas available, because three of the dice rolled within 1-3. Each of those bananas will cost you 2 bucks, because two dice rolled within 4-6.<br/><br/>In other words, when there is a lot of resource available, it costs less. When there isn't much available, it costs more. <br/><br/>Folks over <a href="http://gobi.livejournal.com/770326.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> came up with some crazy permutations of this system, like shifting the 1-3/4-6 margin higher or lower depending on the rarity of a resource. It quickly goes into some dense math that's way beyond my brainmeats.<br/><br/>Thought you all might like to play with it, too. So, what kind of game is this good for?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223163/#Comment_223163" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T08:32:07+00:00" title="August  7, 2009  8:32AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could use something like this for any kind of game that cares about the fictional economy.

They frequently have parallel or subsystems where the sale price at the place you try to then sell your goods is modified by the scarcity of the goods there.  And if the scarcity is so great that they have none, there's often a timer thing that increases the sale price even more.  So player turn order becomes important (and often bid on) as players race around the board trying to sell those bananas at the place where the people haven't had bananas in years.<br/><br/>Are you wanting to make a boardgame or looking for an rpg application?<br/><br/>I recently bought little wooden cubes in 10 different colors and have been playing around with designs where the different color cubes represent different goods (as scores of other boardgames have done before).  I like the idea of different colored dice repesenting the resource themselves.  I've never seen that before.  You'd roll the pool and then set the appropriate number of the dice with their value side up and remove those dice that weren't needed.

On the surface it strikes me as a little like ORE -- you're constantly balancing between getting more or better results (i.e. width x height) -- but in this case you're spinning "better" into "more expensive," with the results being value-neutral "successes."<br/><br/>So maybe in any given conflict, you have a budget. That budget might be set per player, or it might be tied to a character's ability -- characters skilled in fighting get a bigger fighting budget. You roll the dice, and that establishes the available successes as well as the cost-per-success. Maybe each success lets you make one assertion about the conflict -- I block an attack, I deliver a hit, I change my strategy, something -- but you can only buy as many of those assertions as you can afford.<br/><br/>Interesting extensions might be ways to manipulate either the supply or the cost -- some character abilities make specific things cheaper, others increase the available buys automatically. <br/><br/>Hm. Hm.

Medieval Merchant was one I used to own.  Tycoon was another.    Samarkand\u2026  I've purged my collection twice and that wasn't a theme I often bought - just played.  <br/><br/>As far as Ameritrash, Merchant of Venus had demand chits (along with good chits) that were drawn from a cup so that over time the payouts build up and be higher at certain planets as the game went on.  Air Baron had something similar.  Almost all of those those classic pick-up-and-deliver crayon rail games had something like that.<br/><br/>If you're just looking for good economic games a search on bgg of "Economic" or the "pickup and deliver" mechanic will find you some good stuff, by rating.  If you're looking for stuff really close to what Daniel's talking about, I'd have to think about it more.  It's actually a pretty unusual/cool twist where the same single mechanic generates both the number and the price of the resource with an inverse relationship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223353/#Comment_223353" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T21:34:45+00:00" title="August  7, 2009  9:34PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a rather detailed microeconomic sim published by Cheapass Games called "Parts Unknown" where prices for the various body parts were set by a known supply and demand at the previous timestep, modified by a random market direction in the current timestep representing actors outside the local market.
