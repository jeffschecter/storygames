We talked about it today, and he mentioned a few things that frustrated him:<br/>a.) Lack of spontaneity within our group.<br/>b.) A feeling of responsibility and commitment (translation: it's a chore).<br/>c.)Feeling "taken away from" and limited by structures, systems, dice and rules. Kirk is extremely rules-light and he loves math-free gaming.<br/>d.) Feeling like authorship was limited.<br/>e.) Feeling like he couldn't "plug in" where he wnated to.<br/><br/>I get what he's saying, in all cases. I share some concerns, but not others.<br/><br/>So, I talked a bit about Jeepform and how it might be an interesting departure. Not to pressure him, but to explore opportunities. He's been heavily invested in rpgs in the past, and although I'm fine with him leaving that behind him, I don't want him to do so prematurely or without consideration.<br/><br/>We get talking about freeform and play styles and scripting. He talks (again) about how the Bakers free-formed Ars Magica and how that worked. In the past we'd talked about freeforming this Sorcerer game we'd started earlier, in a similar fashion.We decide to experiment on it.<br/><br/>Here are the basic tenets we decided upon, on the walk home from the Skytrain:<br/><br/>1.) Each session, someone else is the Arbiter. That person introduces any and all rules for the session, either at the start or during play as the need arises. There is no session-to-session rules structure. Just one off Arbiter decisions that last one session.<br/>2.) Style and tone and thematic continuity can change between sessions.<br/>3.) Character ownership is seriously deconstructed, even as we desperately cling to certain elements of it.<br/><br/><br/>The Sorcerer game was originally set in a midwest American high school. Sorcerers were high school kids with petty emotional problems. My character was a film student who's lawyer father forced him to join the track team if he wanted his tuition covered. Oh, and he recently realized he was gay (not fun in high school!). Kirk's character was a ridiculously weak-willed guy who wanted to be his popular, successful best friend.<br/><br/>We kept all of these details, but changed some other ones.<br/><br/>(continued)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111226/#Comment_111226" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T01:09:41+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  1:09AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was arbiter for hte first session, and had only two rules:<br/>1.) If you want a demon to help you in a situation, you can't finish your sentence. If you don't finish your sentence, the demon can either help or not, but the other person is filling in the ending.<br/>2.) You can call for a card reading, whenever you want to divine something, or predict something, or read into a situation, or spiritually assess something, or whatever. You justify the card reading, flip some cards, and the other player reads them as if they were a series of tarot cards. Except they're just playing cards.<br/><br/>Two weird and very non-commital rules. Both worked well. The entire session soared. We had fun because we felt narratively uninhibited.<br/><br/>In one scene, Kirk's character Roger was on the porch with Cindy, an NPC. It's a noisy house party, and they're both drunk.<br/><br/>Joe, as Cindy: You look glum. Why don't you drink more?<br/>Kirk, as Roger: There are some things alcohol can't solve.<br/>Joe: Cindy seems hurt, and you can tell she thinks you're talking about her parents' divorce.<br/>Kirk: *flips three cards* I want to know about her parents divorce, and how she understands it.<br/>Joe: *its a three of spades, a seven of hearts, and a king of hearts* Her father was a generous man, full of loving devotion toward her. His love was, *points to the seven of hearts*, highly appreciated. But Cindy's mother, *points to the three*, was barely acknowledged for her hard work. She turned to drinking, and eventually Cindy's father pushed her out of the family, focused on keepign the positivity strong.<br/><br/>And then, after that, I narrate in a 'narrator voice', "It would be a full month before Roger developed sexual feelings for Cindy." This is something I stole from JDCorley's Arrested Development/Star Wars idea. It worked wonderfully in this freeform game.<br/><br/>Another awesome moment:<br/><br/>We had an entire scene where no thoughts or words were actually narrated. I won't script the whole scene, but it went something like this:<br/><br/>Joe: Roger's staring in awe at a string of words, graffitti'd on a building.<br/>Kirk: Roger whispers something under his breath. His mind boggles over the thought... of something. The graffitti shows a string of words, and then an image of a car, and then more words.<br/>Joe: Eerily, that same car shows up behind you, pulling up and cutting its high beams down. It's a cop car.<br/>Kirk: Roger angrily spits something out under his breath.<br/>Joe: The cop thinks something to himself, and says something entirely different.<br/>Kirk: Roger says something, confused. He doesn't know something.<br/>Joe: The cop's voice drops, as he compassionately says something.<br/>Kirk: Roger says something, and beings to walk away.<br/>Joe: As an interesting side note, the moon is by no means full.<br/>Kirk: It will be, however, in seven days... when the cops come to arrest Roger.<br/><br/>That was our first session of Sorcerer Freeform. It worked beautifully. We had a few rules, a few suggested scene guidelines, and a whole lot of random narrative exploration. It was awesome. We played while mixing drinks and cooking lentil/potato/avocado curry, and it was totally low-committment, low-pressure. I want to try fuckign around with this "a handful of rules, and a bucketload of freedom" style of quasi-freeform. It rocks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111240/#Comment_111240" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T04:58:29+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  4:58AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really cool, Joe.

Each session, we swith who's our Arbiter, and that person makes rules and interpretation for that session. My two rules - card readings and leaving unfinished sentences - won't be in effect next session. Or, they might be, if Kirk decides to include them.<br/><br/>Our narrator voice can and probably change drastically during play and between sessions. Which means that when I'm inspired by something JDCorley is talking about in a thread, I can just wholecloth steal it for a session and try it out. If I don't like it, it can be dropped instantly. We also used the other trick he talked about in that thread, with the narrator directly contradicting something just said by a character:<br/><br/>Kirk: Jordan's outside the principal's office, and the secretary says it'll be just a minute.<br/>Joe: The secretary's a forty-three year old virgin.<br/>Kirk: *burst out laughing*<br/>Joe: And Jordan sort of wants to fuck her. Half because she's hot, half out of pity.<br/>Kirk: The secretary, in her secret way, sort of wants to fuck Jordan, too. She thinks to herself, "Hm... he's kind of cute."<br/>Joe: *in narrator voice* In truth, Jordan wasn't cute.<br/><br/><br/>I like the no-pressure element of play. We randomly stopped and took a ten minute break to do dishes at one point in the session, then dove back into it.<br/><br/>I didn't have an emotionally charged situation for Jordan when it was "his turn", so instead I just did this completely exposition sequence which didn't involve him in any way, the Positivity Meet assembly. I just talked about the Principal and the student of the month, and their glasses. And then we cut back to Roger's next scene.<br/><br/>It was cool to have that kind of freedom to explore, or push, or drive the situation in whatever direction we felt was important.<br/><br/>Oh, speaking of the positivity meet assembly, I want to talk more about our school.<br/>It's about 500 students, middle-upper class, midwestern American suburban everytown. "Nothing special".<br/>It's about the right size for everyone to be insignificant.<br/>There's a semi-decent student radio. Some people are super keeners, but most of the school doesn't really care. "Yeah, we have a radio. It's cool, but I don't listen."<br/>There's a track team, and some people are fans. Most don't care.<br/>Same with every school function and group. Acceptance without interest.<br/>But the school... oh, it's dead proud of its achievements. There's this whole weird positivity vibe in the school. They have a monthly Student Positivity Meet, where a Student of the Month is declared. June is Positivity Sweeps Month.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
