A couple of questions I had from reading through the beta (and apologies if these have been addressed elsewhere):<br/><br/>Pacing: Does anyone have any suggestions on how much Threat to throw at the team?<br/><br/>Countdown threats: do you usually have them inflict harm if they\u2019re ignored like other threats?  I suppose this could just be situational.<br/><br/>Suspense scenes: do danger dice inflict harm as normal?  I\u2019m picturing the suspense scenes as being mostly investigation, where it might be a little strange to get hurt, though perhaps I should think of it more as simply stress.<br/><br/>Advancement: would it work to leave some of the (+) fields blank and have them filled in either during play (like open aspects in SotC or Strengths and Weaknesses in 3:16) or between adventures as a simple advancement mechanism?<br/><br/>Also for what it's worth, to make sure the players have plenty of ideas to pump into the story, we're going to use the Day After Ragnarok setting (Axis won WWII with occult help).  The Shadow and Atomic Robo vs. Nazi vampires in post apocalyptic 1940's Chicago.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/avram" title="avram"><img alt="avram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/n64KGLTEFAF9C.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/avram">avram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264117/#Comment_264117" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-25T21:56:47+00:00" title="March 25, 2010  9:56PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>For Suspense scenes, I figure maybe you can take damage, but interpret it in an appropriate way.

Two players are more vulnerable to a short run of bad luck that spawns more threats and has things a bit out of control.  The number of threats relative to the players is as important as the total amount of threat.  Remember that any threat above normal has the potential to spawn a new normal threat each turn it's ignored.  For three players, two major threats and three normal theats (one per player)  is a nice baseline for the first scene.  Hmmm\u2026 that's twenty-one total theat divided by three equals, yeah, seven per player...<br/><br/>Here's the thing you discover quickly about Danger Patrol.  You don't want to run/play it like a game like 4E where you entirely decide beforehand the XP budget for your opposition and then lift the curtain and see what happens.  You want to be flexible.  Let the narrative and even how the Patrol members are doing help determine whether you add more threat to the scene over time.  If the players are rolling super hot, then one of those two major threats should actually be an elite threat if you think the scene needs that.  The Patrol members are going to ultimately going to win the day anyway - just make sure how they get there is fun and exciting.<br/><br/>And Danger Patrol has a lot of flexibility built into it for the GM based on its genre and how the GM describes the dastardly actions the threats are taking.  The players have wised up and determined they all need to focus on the elite threat and ignore the major and normal threats on the board?  Have one of those lesser theats menace a  swooning innocent or call out one of the patrol members, calling their heroic nature into question.  They've just *got* to respond to that!  <br/><br/>I had Coundown threats inflict Harm if ignored.  But they tend not to be ignored\u2026 <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> <br/><br/>Countdown threats are yet another safety valve, by the way.  It's not always entirely clear what's going to happen if that countdown gets to zero.  If the Patrol is doing poorly, maybe what happens isn't all that terrible and vice-versa.<br/><br/>Your Day After Ragnarok setup sounds like a blast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264157/#Comment_264157" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-26T10:34:30+00:00" title="March 26, 2010 10:34AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt's spot on, I haven't run Danger Patrol but John's run it for me a few times, the threats are always very flexible. In the early drafts I actually pushed for more concrete answers to stuff like "do countdown threats do harm?" but they're left open for a reason.<br/><br/>Danger Patrol is crazy flexible, don't try to pre-think situations too much. Throw out a few interesting bits (everyone else at the table will be doing the same) and the dice plus the group take it from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264167/#Comment_264167" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-26T11:27:15+00:00" title="March 26, 2010 11:27AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't run Beta yet.

If you put in too weak a threat, drop in something better down the road. If you put in too big a threat, weaken it on the fly.<br/><br/>Danger Patrol is all about the feel of being an action hero. It's not meant to be D&amp;D style gamist strategy goodness. Your job as GM is to make sure the players are fully submerged, and that means pulling as many ropes and levers as you need to.<br/><br/>But I'll tell you this: I've tended to err on the side of too much threat. It's easier for me if I start modest and bring in reinforcements. Rather than how tough they are, I find that the trick is adding just the right number of things going on. Give the players just a little encouragement to grab danger dice: "If I don't fight the robot, it can attack me. But if I do fight the robot, I can't stop the doomsday device."<br/><br/>For suspense scenes, the kind of harm you take is what those blank lines are for. Instead of stunned you're "seduced," or "intimidated" or whatever's appropriate to the kind of conflict.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roy</cite>Countdown threats: do you usually have them inflict harm if they\u2019re ignored like other threats?  I suppose this could just be situational.</blockquote>\nI haven't done that, or been in a game where they did -- I think of the countdown as saving that harm for later. BTW conflicts are +37% more fun if you include countdowns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roy" title="Roy"><img alt="Roy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roy">Roy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264173/#Comment_264173" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-26T12:29:21+00:00" title="March 26, 2010 12:29PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the great suggestions everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roy" title="Roy"><img alt="Roy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roy">Roy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264899/#Comment_264899" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-01T10:08:42+00:00" title="April  1, 2010 10:08AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Had a great game...posted an AP.

For all of the characters it might be fun for them to have some personal connection with the secret Societ or Nazi lab here, and while I was trying to think of which would be best to flesh out, I realized it might be awesome to be battling a number of threats (in an action or a suspense scene), with one of the threats as "The Key to Your Past."  Make it a Medium level threat, and whoever defeats it first makes up a great narrative detail about the scientist at Science City 13 that remembers them.  Meanwhile as they fight to be first, all hell breaks loose around them from ignored threats.  <br/><br/>I'd love any thoughts you may have there or the idea of leaving (+)'s or even powers to be filled in as an advancement mechanism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
