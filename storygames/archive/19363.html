I used to play in an AD&amp;D game with these guys before the DM left the country. Since then I've been playing in their games and doing occasional one-shots and mini-campaigns for them (mostly using different versions of D&amp;D.)<br/>The setting creation was a collaborative effort. I had them all create their (level 1) characters first and then I built a setting around them.<br/>David wanted to play as the sandworms from Tremors or Dune. He eventually incorporated Lovecraftian elements. He built the character as a Shardmind Brawler-Fighter. <br/>Wade seemed to want to play as a Jabberwocky at first, but he changed his mind and decided to play as a Shoggoth. He built he character as a Carp-Hangeyokai Ardent after I encouraged him to try the leader role.<br/>Adam decided right away that he wanted to play as a giant Kim Il-Sung resurrected by two miko/J-pop stars to make Japan pay for its war crimes. I was hesitant to allow the character at first. He wanted to spring this character on the other players as a surprise, and I don't like character concepts that work that way as I find them to be disruptive. I thought it might lead to some PVP combat, and 4E D&amp;D really isn't built for that kind of gameplay. I also had concerns about the tone of the game. Adam built his character as a Human Monk.<br/>There was one other guy I've never played with who seemed to be interested in playing as a Terrasque at first, then he switched his character concept to the Stay-Pufft Marshmallow Man. He ended up dropping out before we started play. He seemed to be of the opinion that everyone in the group should play as a striker; he insisted that this was the only optimal way to play. He admitted that he didn't really care much for 4E D&amp;D (he believed that the system wasn't well balanced) and that he didn't have much experience playing it. <br/>I allowed each player to take one expertise feat for free, select any skills they wanted instead of selecting from class skills, and I allowed fighters to take one additional bonus skill. David named his guys after foods and drinks.<br/><br/>I also had each player roll up five human characters using Basic D&amp;D rules. Wade made a group of Cthulhu cultists named after anime character characters plus an American exchange student named "Poopy Butt-Face". Adam made a group of Communist revolutionaries including the two pop-stars. <br/><br/>Over the weekend cleaned my apartment, bought a table, reviewed the 4E rules, and unpacked all my dice and all my little toy monsters and dinosaurs I bought at Akihabara during my Tokyo trip.<br/>I prepared three different combat encounters for the occasion and put together a little setting.<br/>The setting was a Neo-Tokyo reconstructed after a post-kaiju-apocalypse now infiltrated by Communist revolutionaries and Cthulhu cults. A few mecha exist to protect the city. The yakuza have made an alliance with a few kaiju and use them to protect their interests. There's also a couple of 'nice' kaiju sleeping under the sea.<br/><br/>Everybody showed up a little after seven. We met up by the subway station and headed up to my apartment where we ordered fried chicken and munched on Pocky while we reviewed our character sheets. Nobody in the group was optimized at all. Nobody even used the 4E character builder. Wade used some sort of third-party Javascript character generator that didn't include the option to select powers. He had to pick out his powers before we could start playing. Adam asked me to print out character sheets for him before the game. David was concerned that he'd have to recreate his character as his laptop was having problems but after he plugged it in he was able to look up his pdfs and pull up his form-fillable character sheet. He needed a refresher on how grappling worked. I'm glad I printed out cheat-sheets for everybody.<br/><br/>I started the game off with little introduction scenes using the human characters.<br/>I had each player decide on where their monster would be first sighted and serve as an assistant DM for their scene. Each other player would add one or two of their human characters to that scene. <br/>Whenever players decided to pick up dice I told them to think about what the risks and rewards would be for the check before throwing the dice. I had a skill challenge planned, but I ended up scrapping it at the last minute.<br/><br/>David did his scene first. His worm burrowed up from below a landfill where it was summoned by Cthulhu cultists. We had to sort out some confusion about where the scene was set since Adam was role-playing his Communist revolutionaries at the diet. The rest of us were puzzled at first as we didn't understand why a couple of Communist J-pop stars were leading a protest against the Japanese government at a landfill, or how the Cthulhu cultists at the landfill were talking to a couple of J-pop stars protesting all the way at the diet, or how protesters at the diet were feeling the tremors from a worm being born under a landfill all the way beyond the outskirts of town. After David clarified where his scene was taking place Adam removed his characters from the scene.<br/>Anyway, the Cthulhu cultists summoned the worm up from the ground and placated it with some food. They fed the monster some garlic, and thus began the worm's obsession with devouring garlic.<br/><br/>Wade did his scene second and set it at Tokyo University. Adam's Communists caused a riot over sushi at the food court and David's thief character looted some stuff while his shoggoth emerged and ate everything.<br/><br/>Adam wanted his scene for last. He set it at the diet. The other monsters were sighted during a protest where Poopy Butt-Face got drunk and passed out. The two J-pop stars summoned the giant Kim Il-Sung by Tokyo tower. He had little oni-horns and a trench coat.<br/><br/>Then we went to combat. <br/>I used the mecha encounter with eight 'Dankmaku Fighter Jets' as artillery-minions and the transforming 'Danmaku Carrier/Danmaku Mecha' as an Elite Brute.<br/>I placed climbable and destructible buildings all around the map and a big traffic jam in the middle of the map as difficult terrain. I scattered the jets all around the edges of the map, placed the carrier on one side, and let the players position their monsters wherever they wanted. We ended up with Kim Il-Sung and the shoggoth near the carrier and the worm on the opposite side of the difficult terrain near a train station. <br/><br/>I did the monster creation wrong. The minions all did 2d8 damage with their ranged weapons as I thought level 1 monsters were supposed to do an average of 9 points of damage at level 1, but apparently that doesn't apply to minions. I'm glad their kamikaze attacks never connected because that would have been too brutal.<br/>After seeing how much trouble the players were having with the jets I decided not to use the carrier's minion-spawning power. The carrier didn't really accomplish much. It got flanked and beaten up badly early on, took a crit from an opportunity attack, never connected with any of its attacks, and died before it got to do anything in its mecha-transformation mode after it was bloodied.<br/>The kaiju took quite a beating too though.<br/>With the defender all the way on the opposite end of difficult terrain lamenting his lack of speed, the striker and the leader both took a lot of damage from those minions. The shoggoth (leader) got knocked unconscious before he got the chance to heal anybody, and Kim Il-Sung (the striker) delivered the coup de grace when he hurled the shoggoth's unconscious body at the mecha. Kim Il-Sung used his second wind, then took more damage from the remaining fighters before delivering a killing blow upon the mecha.<br/>After the mecha was destroyed, the worm and Kim Il-Sung both made their way up to the top of a building where they fought each other. The worm burrowed (teleported) up where Kim Il-Sung had an action readied to grapple him. I had to consult the rules. Thankfully, they were not complicated. Kim Il-Sung's player did not realize that he could use second wind only once per encounter though. The worm bit the hand that grappled him and devoured Kim Il-Sung.<br/>The whole thing is kind of a blur in retrospect so I apologize if I got the sequence of events wrong here.<br/><br/>The whole experience was a complete mess, but everybody had fun.<br/>The guys want to play again some time using new characters, and there's another guy who wants to join in. I'm gonna try and run things more smoothly next time.<br/><br/>So there's my 4E game.<br/><br/>Is 4E D&amp;D a great game for heroic fantasy adventurers exploring dungeons? That's debatable. Is 4E D&amp;D a great game for giant monsters and robots stomping around cities? Hell yeah!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431235/#Comment_431235" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-18T08:55:17+00:00" title="April 18, 2014  8:55AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds.... utterly amazing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pandajelley" title="pandajelley"><img alt="pandajelley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pandajelley">pandajelley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431237/#Comment_431237" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-18T09:17:13+00:00" title="April 18, 2014  9:17AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd try it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431242/#Comment_431242" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-18T10:27:32+00:00" title="April 18, 2014 10:27AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow. Just wow.<br/><br/>But it makes sense. 4E is designed around set-piece battles, so the idea of scaling up the battlefield and the combatants to match is a brilliant articulation of the design. The gap between game-mechanical implementations and their representation in the fiction makes it easy to "re-skin" stuff.<br/><br/>I am very impressed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ursus_Spelaeus" title="Ursus_Spelaeus"><img alt="Ursus_Spelaeus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ursus_Spelaeus">Ursus_Spelaeus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431263/#Comment_431263" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-18T19:47:46+00:00" title="April 18, 2014  7:47PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't get these guys together for a weekly campaign since Wade is busy with his other games and his jewelry-making class, and David has a wife and two kids to look after, but I'm going to try and run this again some time. <br/>Next time we play, I'm going to make sure everybody has the off-line character builder.
