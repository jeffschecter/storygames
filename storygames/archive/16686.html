Five minutes before game time I had one player. So I went down to the sign-up area and tried to poach a player who was an alt for a game that was full up. It worked. Then I needed one more so I roamed the halls and saw this kid maybe 17 or 18 years old in a conference room all by himself playing on his phone. I thought I recognized him and asked him if he wanted to play. He told me he saw my write-up on AW how it said adults only and figured he wouldn't be let in.<br/><br/>I'm not terribly satisfied with how the game went last night. I think the part that bothers me is that I wasn't as brave as I thought. I was all hopped up on the emo awesome of a few games I'm playing on forum and Skype and thought I could just BRING IT. But then I'm there with these strangers and I realize they have no idea what this game is, what playing this way can be like, and I take them to square one and try to kickstart, but I see them shirk from some stuff early so I just drop back and punt.<br/><br/>The lady who described her Brainer was making her very sexualized (hot blonde in leather and a bodice and high heels) and I could have keyed on that, but I saw the other two players not responding to it, so I took it to a more general level. I just alluded to people finding her fascinating or hot and that seemed to please the player. Well, I think she wanted more spotlight on that and I didn't give it to her. <br/><br/>The guy who chose the Hardholder was the strongest of the group. He just got out of Navy training and he really got into setting up the map and talking about defenses, so much so that I let him run with it and just tried to point out personality conflicts rather than strategic ones. Like "Oh yea, you could swap out these two gangs and send Atrium, but she just lost her first ganger and she's pretty broken up about it, are you sure she's in fighting shape?" and 'Ba can take a crew out for that run, but he comes up to you and says, 'Hey Boss, the shit is going down here, what did I do wrong to get sent off on a milk run, huh?'" and things like that. I felt that was pretty strong.<br/><br/>The third player chose the Angel and we had some fun with him talking to patients and he tried to cut some deals that was cool. He had a scene with Grief, one of his allies and I felt that was pretty strong. Grief was about his age, but I left the defining of their relationship to him, didn't hint if there was romance. He kept it neutral so I followed his lead.<br/><br/>It's funny. With strangers who don't play the way we do, asking a bunch of questions can put them on the spot. I saw them being uncomfortable several times. I tried to soothe things, encourage, cheer them on with good ideas. Its a ton of work. A lot of stress in places where my head isn't normally focused. This shit can be hard.<br/><br/>Anyways, thanks for letting me ramble for a bit, I had a bunch to unpack.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381624/#Comment_381624" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-09T10:25:55+00:00" title="June  9, 2012 10:25AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure if you were looking for comments, but the thing I notice about the above is the missing phrase: "What do you do?"

I can imagine that would be hard! Whenever I've played AW, the players were really Jazzed to play the game. How did you kickstart? What 'Intro Speil' did you go with? I think that could be the key... Vincent's con game has wonderful letters that immediately immerse the characters in the story, without so much uncomfortable questioning. <br/><br/>That said, I think your emergent story sounds great! I like that you encouraged the players to shine in their own right and pushed where the status quo was shaky. Did you debrief after? Was there any feedback from the players?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381637/#Comment_381637" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-09T16:05:10+00:00" title="June  9, 2012  4:05PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AW is a particularly intense game to play with strangers, always a ht-or-miss proposition in the first place.

I think the what wasn't my issue, it was the How. The tone, the fact that I didn't push to hard decisions as much as roll and deflect, put up some challenge, but generally let them be the very important people. Its hard to describe, but maybe I was too much a fan of the PCs? My NPCs were paper thin, not fully realized. I think I could have read through Hatchet City more, played it with some friends first, had a better grounding.<br/><br/>For example, the Hardholder, Uncle Jackson, fresh off the assassination attempt from Michi, has Rubix hanging around with him. I ask the player of Uncle Jackson what he looks like, he says he's a hulking big guy. I take that and add in that he has criss-crossed scars on his face (thinking of Delroy Lindo's character in Blood of Heroes) and he's got dreds, too. Then people talk to him and I try to give him a deep voice, fill the room with him. And I realize, after I;'ve already had him talking, that I'm doing Patrick Warburton. Then to my horror, I realize further that I'm basically playing him as Brock Sampson.<br/><br/>The hardholder tells me Peanut, the gang leader in charge of compound defense is twitchy. Bam, I'm constantly moving and I'm doing a bad impression of Woody Allen.<br/><br/>It's just frustrating, that I ran to humor. That I willfully became the dancing monkey. Just lazy reactive storytelling. Embarrassing.<br/><br/>Sorry, I'll stop castigating myself. Story Games can be hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381743/#Comment_381743" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T16:22:53+00:00" title="June 10, 2012  4:22PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AW is particularly hard as a con one-shot.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of games: BW, AW, Dogs, Freemarket, that you can play at a con as a one-shot but at the table they tend to really kick out of 3rd and 4th gear into overdrive after more sessions than a con can generally hold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381880/#Comment_381880" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T12:00:23+00:00" title="June 11, 2012 12:00PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had a fair amount of success running Apocalypse World as a one-shot, so I'm not sure I agree with folks that it's particularly difficult. <br/><br/>It can be difficult when you put people on the spot and ask them questions... and find they don't want to answer them. If playing the game is like pulling teeth -- the game is about hard decisions and they don't want to make any, or if you're just trying to flesh out the world ("Who do you buy ammo from?") and they're not helping much -- it's definitely much harder going. But sometimes it's a matter of modeling the world around them so they have stuff to riff off of ("Well, you can get ammo from A, B, and C [all kinda bad or mixed]. Which one is it?"). Or putting them in less open-ended situations where the choices available to them are clearer (sometimes you can do this by saying "Do you want to read a charged situation?" since your answers to those questions often give them some ideas of things to do).<br/><br/>It's also definitely easier if you play a chopper + gang, or operator + crew, or something else that focuses the character concepts and gives everyone a collective task. I like operator + crew the best because then you open play by rolling gigs and you can figure out if they just did a thing (and have to deal with the fallout from that) or just botched a thing (and are in the middle of a crisis), which is a good way to kick things off. You could probably write a custom move that did a similar thing for other types of groupings.<br/><br/>In any event, not every game you run -- especially convention games with random strangers -- is going to turn out great. It's really tough, especially when you go in wanting to get people excited about a game and show them how much you love it. But hopefully talking about it a bit makes you feel better (it's a kind of confessional, right?) and you'll get a chance to play it again soon and prove to yourself that you can really knock the game out of the park, shaking off that "awkward game" feeling that can sometimes linger for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
