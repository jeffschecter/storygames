One PC had been starving in the desert, found another wanderer and killed and ate him.  Ever since he'd been haunted by the ghost of the slain man.  The PCs had accidentally stumbled onto the slain man's nine year old son, who had sold his soul to the devil to get his father back.  The father had promised that he would return to his family, no matter the cost.  So when the PCs found the family, the eaten guy's ghost manifested as a poltergeist trying to kill all of them.  <br/><br/>(There's a separate bite sized story in here about time travel and the murder of a small but not innocent child, but it's not relevant to the ear.)<br/><br/>Finally, the cannibal decided that the only thing to do was to return the ghost to his family.  Since he had eaten the father a long time before, his flesh was fully incorporated into his own.  So he had to simply take a piece of himself and remove it and leave it behind.<br/><br/>So he cut his own ear off and set it on the parlor table.
