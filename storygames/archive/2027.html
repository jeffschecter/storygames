                    So, many games I play these days let you make explicit decisions that have <b>massive</b> consequences for the length of your campaign.  As a single for-instance:  in Primetime adventures you choose an <i>Issue</i> for your character, and that issue massively shapes absolutely everything that follows.<br/>
<br/>
This makes me nervous.  What if I <b>do it wrong</b>?  Can I really trust myself to get <i>the right Issue</i>?  And if I don't, and everyone else builds their characters to interact with my issue, I'm pretty much stuck with playing it and having it suck for ... what ... five sessions?  Nine?  Depends on the length of the game, of course.<br/>
<br/>
It's a fear of commitment, pure and simple.  Do other people feel it too?                </div>

<p>Can't say I have, man.  But I suppose that's because I tend to walk into a game with the attitidue that the rules can be negotiated.  And therefore, if I were to start second-guessing a long-term choice, I'd just negotiate with the other players to let me change that choice.</p>

                            I also think about this. IME, I most often "find" what issue I want to address after play starts.<br><br>Because of this, I'm leery of the current trend of front-loading thematic issues---aka "flagging" issues at the very start of play.<br><br>Awhile ago, someone... Emily Care Boss maybe, commented that freeform often passes through two phases. The first is the experimental stage, where players don't know who their characters are and what direction play should travel. After a while, a certain direction will emerge. At that point, players usually shift modes and start pushing that direction.<br/><br/>You can see this progression in most RPGs, IME. And I think that's something designers should be aware of and try to design for, that players won't "find themselves" until after playing a little while.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Tony, ya' big teddy bear... if it makes you feel any better, since this is a question about Primetime Adventures, remember that even <i>actaul</i> pilots that are <i>actually aired</i> often are shaky and things change after the first few episodes as the show finds it's legs.<br/>
<br/>
Think of the the pilot of Seinfeld (there's a reason why it tested badly, actually!) or the pilot for Star Trek: Next Generation (no matter what you think of the series, the pilot isn't what the series ultimately delivered.)<br/>
<br/>
It's an RPG group. You're with friends. You're creating somethig together. If something needs to be tweaked as you go, you guys tweak it. Right?<br/>
<br/>
Have fun. Have a good time.<br/>

Yes, yes, I understand all of that.  I also recognize that if you get into a marriage that just doesn't work out you can go into counselling or get a divorce.  But I don't know that it makes the question of commitment all that much easier on an emotional level.  I was inspired particularly by <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22576.0" rel="nofollow">this actual play thread</a> over on the Forge.  Antti describes how everyone took the initial steps of laying down the groundwork <i>way too seriously</i>.  They were being paralyzed by blank page syndrome, as amplified by the amount of commitment they were being asked to make in putting forth their ideas.                        </div>

                            Tony &amp; Tim -- the concern is a real one, and the thing that solves the problem for me are self-correcting mechanics.  They could be a little more explicit in the text of <em>PTA</em>, but to take it as an example, (a) the pilot allows you to try things out and see if you want to retool things before you start the 'real' season, and this includes your issue; and (b) you can change your issue during or after your spotlight episode, so if you were worried about doing it wrong, you could simply make your spotlight episode the second or third episode, giving you the option of switching it out for something different later.<br><br>Similarly, Keys can be bought off, Thematic Batteries can be swapped out, and BITs can be reshuffled and rewritten.  (These also have the added bonus of redundancy; if one isn't working for you, you have a couple more that might do better.)  Now, I do think it would be a good idea for any game that front-loads content or themes like these to have a little sidebar or something for the folks who worry about getting it wrong, explicitly telling them that they can change things in play, and pointing out optimal strategies for doing so.<br><br>(And welcome back, Tony!)                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Tony,<br><br>This sort of thing happens all the time when I play Hero's Banner. Of course, in HB your character will be dead in a session or two, so the long-term commitment is minimized. Nevertheless, the game still forces players to choose what they want their characters to be about at the start of the game and that's a big deal.<br><br>In more general terms, I'm not quite so leary of this type of mechanic as I once was. At least I know what I'm getting into when I start a game of HB or whatever. Many games, on the other hand, have a front-loading problem that they don't even telegraph to the player. You can even think about this in terms of D&amp;D. What happens if you choose Ranger class, and realize two sessions later that you hate playing a Ranger and all of the baggage that comes with it? Too bad, you're stuck and you didn't even realize you were making a big commitment to begin with. Ok, sure you can convince the other players in any game to retool things for you. Still, I think there's a difference between a game like PTA, Breaking the Ice, HB, etc., where the making of these important decisions is explicit in the rules, and other games where you have to tease out the fact that you're doing the same thing but without any mechanics to help you out.<br/><br/>I suppose you can look at any game in terms of (1) how much commitment to theme, etc., you have to make before play starts, (2) to what degree does the game help you or at least formalize the process of making these decisions in the pre-game stage, and finally (3) how much does the game allow you to make changes (things like buying off keys in TSoY) once the game gets rolling. I can't think of any game that doesn't require at least some commitment during the pre-game, but surely the degree to which that commitment affects or even defines the actual play to come can vary greatly. And as with any gaming preference, these sorts of things can be varied from a design point of view to suit different styles and players. I don't, for instance, think that all heavily pre-loaded games should necessarily have heavy-handed mechanics available to the players to facilitate change in the actual play stage. But playing that sort sort of game would definitely require some serious forethought.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi Tony,<br/>
<br/>
I know this is a big deal. I've been there before. But I'm going to say, logically, the fact that you are in any way comparing playing an RPG to the comittments of marriage something is <i>way</i> off. I'm not denying you're <i>feeling</i> this. I'm saying something is off.<br/>
<br/>
I just finished my best piece of writing -- ever. (And by that I mean, good enough for me to think, "Thank god. I <i>can</i> write.")<br/>
<br/>
I bring this up because here's how I did it: I trusted I would move forward. I put down one idea after another and just <i>kept going.</i><br/>
<br/>
I don't know if you saw Ron's posted reply to Antii. I almost posted it as my first response to you. He addresses things that gummed me up in my games years ago -- and even recently. (And, even, actually, in my writing -- because again, like games, writing a script is simply not as big a deal as, say, making a marriage -- but it can feel that way.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm going to quote it in full:<br/>
<br/>
<b><i>Hi Antti,<br/>
<br/>
The people who've replied have asked a lot of questions. I'm posting instead to say, it might not be a big deal, and to offer some <i>possible </i> explanations for what you are encountering.<br/>
<br/>
1. In 1994 or so, I and a few friends had not role-played for two or three years, and decided to start playing together. It was terrible. We spent ages doing the simplest things, just like you describe. For some reason, everyone had 100 opinions but no one was good at getting anything started in actual play. Looking back, I think that all of us were so concerned with how games had <i>not </i> been fun in the past, that we were too hesitant and too uncertain. We did everything to avoid trouble rather than to have fun.<br/>
<br/>
2. I think you are right about the problems with authority. The real trouble, in my view, is that simply saying "the GM does it" is actually not a very good solution; it puts the pressure for enjoyment onto a single person for too long, for instance. We can talk about this a little bit more later.<br/>
<br/>
3. I've observed the pressure you've described many times. I think it's based more on fear than reality. If the people are accustomed to playing with one person have total scene-authority - and also the responsibility for it to be "good" - then they get the idea that any input of that kind also has to be masterful, authoritative, prepared, and generally idealized as "good GMing." They can't see it, yet, as just throwing the ball up into the air and <i>not </i> knowing where or how it will land. So there you are, sitting at the table, and bam! You have to do it (make the scene, take "story responsibility," be good, be perfect, "do it right," et cetera) and it seems like everyone is looking at you.<br/>
<br/>
However, the reality is much easier. In many ways, it is like learning how not to use certain muscles when doing something athletic - rather than having dozens of responsibilities at the moment, you really only have one or two, leaving the rest up to others' input and to the interactions during the scene itself. Instead of concerning yourself with the perfect <i>setup</i>, you begin with the minimum necessary and then only concern yourself with playing <i>within </i> the scene.<br/>
<br/>
My main point is, have patience. All of what you're experiencing is like shaking the dust and dead bugs out of the bedsheets. It's kind of gross and icky at the moment, but it has to be done, and the end result is much more pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
Best, Ron</i></b>"<br/>
<br/>
Here's one of many useful words: "...leaving the rest up to others' input and to the interactions during the scene itself."<br/>
<br/>
In other words: start and trust. You will find a way through the process of character creation, the process of the scene, the process of the session. But you'll do it by trusting the act of creativity and intereaction with others.<br/>
<br/>
What we're talking about here is peformance anxiety. Trust me, I know all about this. When I was finishing the re-write on the script, my body was flush, I kept pacing, my head was dizzy. I had to force myself to sit down and write, almost line by line, the last four pages. Because I knew I couldn't make it any better and I was going to have to show it to people!<br/>
<br/>
But I'm suffering through the same thing on a new script I'm writing right now. Same stuff. I'll be thinking, "This idea isn't good enough." Or, "This scene won't work." Whatever. It's the same anxiety a musician or an athlete has before going out to do the job.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I find really smart about the talk about people putting story first in their games is <i>exactly</i> this point about performance anxiety. If Gamism is gamig the rules for prestige, then Narrativism is being creative for prestige. You know what is good (even you if actually CAN'T know it ahead of time) and the mind and body begin to freak out beause you want to create well. It is NO different than being in a room of writers working on a script, being on a set in front of a cast and crew while trying to do the best work you can.<br/>

                            [continued p. 2]<br/>
<br/>
So, I'd say the following.<br/>
<br/>
1) From my reading on the matter, understand that this is GOOD. We want to do well, and your body is pumping us up to be ready -- even making us feel, as Attii says, <b><i>"Write four relationships into the protagonist sheet." Suddenly, it becomes a matter of life and death.</i></b> It clearly <i>isn't</i> a matter of life or death, but our body doesn't know how to modulate that.<br/>
<br/>
2) Don't try to get rid of the fear or anxiety. Just do the deed. Focusing on the anxiety will not help. Doing the deed will.<br/>
<br/>
3) Trust that something good will happen if you focus on the deed. In fact, this is one of the real draws of games for making stories with people -- you're all there to support the process. When I get stuck in a scene these days I STILL get that panic that says, "Oh, no, I picked the wrong scene, in fact, this scene won't work, in fact, the whole idea for what I've done so far sucks and I should go back and start again..."<br/>
<br/>
But I don't. Cause I'm smarter now. And I think, "In ways I cannot yet see, I've picked all the choices up to this point for a reason. And I picked this scene for a reason. And I'm going to finish this scene, and get to the other side of it, and by doing that, I'll see the next scene, and I'll then see why I picked the scene I'm working on, and I'll be really glad I wrote through it."<br/>
<br/>
In other words, I'm trusting my creative process now. I'm trusting my imagination. A basketball player doesn't have time to think, "Do I know all the moves I'm going to need to get me through the game I'm about to play?" He can't be thinking about whether he picked he right coach back in high school. He's got to play the game NOW. And only by playing the game, moment by moment, with what has come before -- by BUILDING ON whatever choices have come before and not second-guessing himself, does he have a shot at getting the ball in the net and working effectively with his team.<br/>
<br/>
I'm offering the same to you. Pick an "Issue" for PtA and trust that from that choice you will make other choices that <i>work</i>. Since the whole point of PtA is to keep moving forward through scenes that spin variation on the Issue, all you need to do is start one scene after another that deal with the Issues. Trust me, if you start, you can finish. And inbetween you'll find a way of addressing the issue in an entertaining way. Especially if you don't start the scene knowing how you'll do that!<br/>
<br/>
The only way to go wrong is to second guess and decide you already made a mistake before or during the scene. The human imagination is ridiculous -- just <i>ridiculous</i> -- in it's ability to spin gold from simple ideas. You must trust that you will find ideas as needed.<br/>
<br/>
4) The Issue can be changed. Joshua was explicit about how the rules can help in this. I was blunt and said, "Look, if someone has a better idea, change it." But I wouldn't do it because it's "not working." That's running from the challenge. And it's by walking through the challenge (like stepping onto the basketball court and plaing) that one finds solutions one could never have expected or planned before play.<br/>
<br/>
Know that simple ideas, like an Issue in PtA, is your ally in the effort to produce scene material, not an enemy.<br/>
<br/>
This is so vital I reall need you to pay attention.<br/>
<br/>
When a painter paints, he limits his palet. He does this for two reasons: One, the human eye can handle only so many colors at a time before they go all fuzzy; and Two, it lets him handle what colors he is using better, so he can be more effective in complentary and contrasting colors and such.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, by limiting his pallet, he becomes more effective as an artist.<br/>
<br/>
How? Because he has provided Unity to the painting. And we human beings love Unity. We love knowing things "line up" in a story or piece of art <i>even if we are not aware of how it's Unified</i>. One of the things that Unifies the movie <i>Aliens</i> is that it's a struggle between two mothers -- even if many (most?) audience members didn't pick up on that. Same with a limited choice of colors for a painting.<br/>
<br/>
However, too much Unity means boredom. So we mix the colors and we get Variety. If I'm working with, say  Red and Green as my two colors, it looks like I'm really stuck. But I'm not. Because if I mix red and green, they provide variations on red and green. And if I mix them in equal proportions I get a nice neutral gray because they're contrasting colors and cancel each other out. So I get this range of of colors and values I can use to create apples on a green cloth if I want, with the mixed colors providing form shadows and shadows which provide depth and the illusion of form.<br/>
<br/>
Unity and Variety.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. We freak beause we want to pick the "right" Issue or whatnot, when that's not the issue at all. The game (the creative game) is to pick an Issue that turns you on and then spin Variety from it in one scene after another.<br/>
<br/>
But how does one know an Issue will do this? Beause ALL issues provide scene material. How does one know one's brain is the right brain for this issue? Because human beings are fucking awesome and will always provide more material.<br/>
<br/>
The Value of the Issue (or the Humanity Scale in Sorcerer, or the Dark Fates in Mountain Witch or whatever) is that they <i>focus our creative thinking.</i> They are our allies. They provide Unity so we're not running all over our imagination's inner-landscape, rummaging through this or that to find SOMETHING to focus on.<br/>
<br/>
By limiting ourselves right off the bat we can move forward with the variety.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, it's a limitation that's not a limitation. You're never "stuck" with the wrong Issue. What you have is a springboard for countless, entertaining moments.<br/>
<br/>
If you go into each scene knowing -- and I mean, absolutely knowing -- that if you keep moving forward with the scene you will find the entertaining Variation on that Issue that will reveal something about the character and be entertaining. You may not hit it out of the park on every scene.... But who does that with anything. But you will NEVER be stuck.<br/>
<br/>
6) Now you might be thinking, "What if it's boring scene material? Or boring to me?" And all I can say is, I believe that if you chose it for genunine interest during character creation it's because it really does speak to you.<br/>
<br/>
I'll go further -- from my own experience and the work I've done with other writers, usually when we're back peddling (not always, but usually) it's because we know the idea (that Issue or whatever Unifying element turned us on) is so close, so warm that we're afraid of it. We're afraid of what we might discover or what we might reveal. Which is, of course, gold. So move forward.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
If you thought of an Issue and it tickled you in one way or another, trust it.<br/>
<br/>
When you get scared of it, trust it.<br/>
<br/>
When you don't know what to do with it when you're starting a scene, trust it.<br/>
<br/>
The anxiety isn't ours to control (outside of leaving behind things we care about most -- which I tried for years, by the way, and it really makes your life suck).<br/>
<br/>
What is our to control is stepping forward with the anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
That's the best I got.<br/>

                            Oh, one more thing.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helped me with my <i>screenwriting</i> was Ron's essay at the end of <i>Sorcrere &amp; Sword</i> and then reading a lot of the Howard stories Ron recomended.<br/>
<br/>
In Ron's outline of how to play S&amp;Sword I saw a blunt TRUST in the creative process. The players, simply, were going to figure it out as they moved forward. They didn't need to know <i>everything</i> ahead of time. They didn't need a big detailed world. They didn't need to know all the crap they were carrying. They didn't need to know the "story" they were going to tell. By starting with certain key, engaging (<i>to them</i>) crystal seeds, the thing would grow out propperly.<br/>
<br/>
And then, when I read Howard's stories, I found that same, breezing, fun energy in the tales. In the edition of the book I had, there were notes from Howard at the back on him building his stories. Really fun stuff. But, importantly, the same process Ron was advocating for S&amp;Sword was in Howard's work as well.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say, reading Howard's work helped my writing immensely, if only because Howard taught me to a) get on with it, and b) trust it.<br/>

I very much have it, with a few traditional games. It's actually the reason that I couldn't fall head-over-heels with D&amp;D/d20, actually. Even with (as Eric said) you have total buy-in from the other players on changing aspects:<br><br>"Hmmm. I'm not feeling this issue, and the last session ran strange because of it. Instead of "Avenge Father's Death", I'm thinking "Find my own destiny". What do you think?"<br><br>vs:<br><br>"Hmmm, I really picked the wrong feat back at 3rd level. Now I'm 16th level and can't get the feat I want that will let me take the prestige class I was aiming to get by 14th level. I'm thinking of adjusting all of my feats, and thus by extension my hit points, skills, saving throws and even class". <br><br>Fear of messing up my 'career path' has really put me off playing most D&amp;D (unless it's a set campaign with at least some soft boundaries; no more 'start at first level, and keep going baby!' stuff). It's a little bit easier to get around in point-buy systems (since the elements of the character aren't so interrelated; 'this hinges on this, that hangs on that', etc) like GURPS or Shadowrun, but much harder with level systems.<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<br/>
I'm with Tony. This is not to say that I think PTA is a bad design, nor that things won't get somewhat ironed out in play. But...<br/>
<br/>
Why not have an explicit mechanic for changing your character's issue at some point? I'm sure you screenwriters have a term for this when it happens to some character in a TV series. For example being an avid watcher of House, I note that his buddy has had his issue go from "How do I help an intractible bastard" to "Where do my loyalties lie, with House or with the Law and Ethics?"<br/>
<br/>
It's a huge transition for the character.<br/>
<br/>
Drifting the issue a little won't result in this sort of change. At least not without violating the spirit of the rule, it seems to me. So I'm thinking that there should be ways to opt to alter things at some point.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying to make it easy, either. There's certainly something to be said for committment. I'm just saying that a little build in flexibility, mechanically, might be a good thing for things like this. In other game systems character issues are derived from situation and character nature. PTA is more direct, but with the "old" method at least there was no trouble changing the character issue focused upon.<br/>

                            There's another way to approach this (although I can't really beat Christopher's rad posts) which is to say "FUCK IT" when thinking about the future. It helps if you've had quite a number of aborted campaigns that have died after a session or two. Just play what you think will be cool now and don't worry about whether it will be cool up the road.<br><br>Same applies to Andy's feat choice decision. I have explicitly demanded that NOBODY plan out ANY class development for their characters in my D20 games for some time now. Every time you go up a level in our game you just pick stuff that you've been doing and stuff you want to be doing, and if you end up qualifying for an advanced/prestige class? Aces. If not, at every stage of the process you're a hundred percent satisfied, guaranteed. And it cuts down on the "I gotta get just the right feat" feeling and accelerates character creation drastically.                        </br></br></div>

But in PTA that's voiding the chargen rules. It'd be like not picking a character class at all in D&amp;D. It's fuel the game needs to work.<br/>

Still, even if that's the case, that's committing up to, and through, the climax. If you have a real change of heart before that? Is there some valve at that point?<br/>

                            Well, guys, this isn't really (for me) specifically about PTA.  It could just as easily be (as folks have pointed out) feats in D&amp;D, or the attribute auction in Amber, or lifepaths in Burning Wheel.<br/>
<br/>
But ... and here's something that really tickles me particularly, I don't get the same fear of commitment on <b>any</b> of those mechanics if we're playing a one evening one-shot.  One evening?  Screw it.  I can do one evening standing on my head, if it comes to that.<br/>
<br/>
I think this ties in, somewhat, with the other issues of <i>time</i> commitment that go along with social footprint.  There are circumstances in which a game that is intended to run a short period of time makes it <i>easier to start the game</i> than one meant to run for a longer period.                        </div>

<p>Tony,</p>
<p>Your last post made me wonder: what ratio of short-term vs. long-term games have you been playing in lately. It could be that you've simply gotten used to short-term play. Now, when facing a long-term game, it all looks so daunting. To use your metaphor, say you're a guy whose done nothing but play the field for years. Suddenly you find a girl who's right for you. It's all so permanent from this guy's point of view now. That's scary. He's not used to commitment. But it's not that he doesn't know how to commit necessarily -- it's just scary.</p>
<p>Back to gaming, that's also not to say that you can't slowly drift your game in one direction or another after you start. You simply have to be willing to make <em>some</em> initial commitment to get the ball rolling. Again, I still think that some games are better than others at both helping players to front-load themes or to at least help them change themes mid-game.</p>

But Andy! This is one of the chief beauties of the current incarnation of D&amp;D! You gotta be shrewd enough to figure out how to min-max your guy for maximum effectiveness way down the line. If you mess up, suck it. If you're playing with a gamist agenda, this is great; you can strive to be a winner and not a loser.<br><br>How's this any different than building a killer deck in Magic? If you forget to include just the right card in that killer combo, you get your ass handed to you. You regroup, and hopefully you can apply what you've learned to building a better deck the next time.<br><br>Oh... But it <i>is</i> different, ain't it? If you mess up in Magic, you won't have to endure it long -- a unit of play is like less than an hour. A unit of play in D&amp;D can be as much as several hours every week for years -- if you screwed up a feat choice back at level two, and now at level twelve it's making the difference between being the super megalo-badass and being Generic Fighter, you're often stuck with it.<br><br>Which brings us back to the initial topic.<br><br>(I do think you've sold me on starting at higher levels in D&amp;D, though.)<br><br>I think the solution is "Story Now," or its natural, universally applicable extension, "Fun Now." Which I'm a big proponent of. Delayed gratification in RPGs is frequently a miserable notion.<br><br>But this flies in the face of some stuff the Durham 3 have been talking about, about how it usually takes about three games to see how things are shaping up thematically and everything starts rockin'. <br><br><br><br>So Tony, are you looking to find some kind of <i>solution</i> with this thread or did you just generally want to commiserate about that anxiety?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            For what it's worth, Tony, I am really nervous in any new game that doesn't have a definite plan for its length.  I'm perfectly comfortable at a one-shot, a three-session run, a once-a-month-all-this-year, and so on.  I way, way uncomfortable at "however long it ends up running" because I can't plan.  Like, at all.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I have explicitly demanded that NOBODY plan out ANY class development for their characters in my D20 games for some time now. Every time you go up a level in our game you just pick stuff that you've been doing and stuff you want to be doing, and if you end up qualifying for an advanced/prestige class? Aces. If not, at every stage of the process you're a hundred percent satisfied, guaranteed. And it cuts down on the "I gotta get just the right feat" feeling and accelerates character creation drastically.</blockquote>
Hm.  Personally, I think it's <i>fun</i> to plan out a character in D20, up to and including aiming for a prestige class (if there's actually a prestige class that's interesting, which is rare in my experience).  It gives me something to think about outside the game session that is 100% under my control and not dependent on what the other players do at all.  Sometimes it gives me a goal that I can use to steer the way I play my character.  It gives me an acceptable way to tinker with a system when I'm not the GM.  It's part of the game for me, one of the things that rounds out the playing experience and makes me happy.<br><br>I think if a GM ever explicitly demanded that I stop doing that, I'd nod and smile at him and just keep right on doing it, because seriously, what's he going to do to stop me?  Tell me to take a different feat?  Force me to assign skill points a different way?  Give me an electric shock every time I drift off at work and think about what I'd like to do with my PC the next time we level up?  Ha!  As if!<br><br>I'd bet good money that at least one of your players is still thinkin' ahead about what they want to do with levelling up, your explicit demands be damned.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

I mean, sure I worry about those things, but I just <i>don't play</i> games that demand that much commitment anymore. Playing long-term games with adults involves way too much cat herding, with real-life scheduling issues almost guaranteed to take the whole thing apart at some point. I think it's less about my own concern for having fun, as that I'm not willing to vouch to others that it will be fun and that their commitment of time -- and esteem for my say-so in these matters -- will not be wasted.<br><br>Also, Kubasik is right on!<br><br>Edit: link fixin'                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Lifepaths in BW aren't where we set our issue.  It is in the Beliefs and they can be changed at any moment.<br><br>I absolutely do feel the committment tug and it really helps to play games where I can swap it out, like buying out keys in TSoY or changing my issue in PTA after my spotlight or just realizing that my Belief in BW isn't playing out the way I had hoped.<br><br>I played in a PTA game a few months ago and my character was a cannibal school marm who had left her husband, the King of the Cannibals and come to live with the good farming folk of Manhattan in our post-apoc game.  Her issue for the pilot was just fitting in without being ashamed of the culture where she came from.  In her spotlight episode, the first scene, she ripped out the throat of her husband.<br><br>Suddenly she was queen and for the rest of the series her issue was integrating her people into the society of Manhattan's villages.<br><br>And I've gone through two Beliefs in Burning Wheel, one because I absolutely got what I wanted and another because after a key scene, I realized that I wasn't willing to go as far as I thought to re-instate my family into power and what I was really doing was supporting the young heir to the throne so that he could grow to be a sorcerer-king and make the empire great again.<br><br>Anyway, I guess what I am saying is that being able to change those is key for me.  When it comes to issues in play, I'm polyamorous or maybe a serial monogamist...not sure.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I have played in two games where my character concept just didn't fire at all. It's a pretty frustrating thing to happen. Both of these games (one Vampire, one 7th Sea) lasted only for two sessions or so, and probably me not having fun were part of the reason. I've had some other characters that were okay, but afterwards I thought I could have done better. No one can always do it perfectly.<br/>

But Tony, frankly, from what I've read of your actual play, you are about the last person I would expect to mistrust their creativity and skill in creating a good issue.                        </div>
