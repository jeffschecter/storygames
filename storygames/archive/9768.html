However, I can't help but feel that there is a disconnect between Trooper Creation and game play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game includes mechanics to benefit your memories if they link to existing Story or Rumour, but no benefit for connecting to Next of Kin, Background or Last Night. As these are the only three "stats" a starting character has, it would be nice if there was some benefit to bringing them up in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I wouldn't want them to provide the same "wild card" bonus as linking a memory to Story or Rumour. Perhaps a re-roll benefit?<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217328/#Comment_217328" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-08T17:52:37+00:00" title="July  8, 2009  5:52PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey Dyson,</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, I've got all kinds of things to say about this.

They may not have mechanical weight but they were indeed extremely important, especially when one considers 2 of 3 items are determined by a different player.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos" title="Dyson Logos"><img alt="Dyson Logos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos">Dyson Logos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217890/#Comment_217890" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-12T17:18:57+00:00" title="July 12, 2009  5:18PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I found them useful for the "mental image" of the character, as stated, I can't help but feel that /some/ mechanical weight would be beneficial.<br><br>As to your question about the games: <br><br/>We\u2019ve played the game three times \u2013 the first two sessions were about an A-Team in Vietnam, very much pulled from the pages of the Recon RPG.
