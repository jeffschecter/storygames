So, I started to wonder what essential game information you needed on a small document in order to kick play into shape and wrangle details.  I asked some of my friends at NerdNYC and what I came up with was the following:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i157.photobucket.com/albums/t77/EricTLarsen/GMCharSheetver3.jpg"/><br/><br/>There's some discussion about whether or not the blue and purple sections should be on the same side.  Also whether or not the System Rules section should be removed entirely: to remove any Rights discussion; and because specific system rules are probably more easily followed in photo-copies or in the original books.<br/><br/>I'd wondered if there shouldn't be another section, up front, that included maxims and affirmations (nuggets of wisdom) that help keep your game on track (eg. "Story First" etc)?<br/><br/>Is there anything missing from the overview?  What cribsheets and information do you want at hand when you start a game?  What information about Running have you stolen from other games/systems that you use universally?<br/><br/>thanks, e.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LaughingJackWilton" title="LaughingJackWilton"><img alt="LaughingJackWilton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LaughingJackWilton">LaughingJackWilton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252406/#Comment_252406" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-24T18:45:25+00:00" title="January 24, 2010  6:45PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think number 3 is pretty cool.

I think you could make a generic sheet where a GM could keep his notes most pertinent to both the campaign and the game at hand. But, like some people above I am also convinced this would only blossom when coupled with specific mechanics. <br><br>Note: the character sheet is not a place where players note down their in-character diary or something, it's basically a rules and numbers quick-reference. It's a memetic tool.<br><br>I think the games that would most benefit from a "GM sheet" are those that have very direct, focused rules for the GM to follow. In a game where I'm supposed to fiat and improvise it all, why would I need a specific sheet? I can just scrible onto any piece of paper I find, if needed.<br>Now, games with strong story or scene structure, act progression, and intense GM-procedures to follow, yes, in those cases a sheet would be great I believe. <br><br>What would I put on a GM sheet for <br>*FATE? List of random names and bangs to drive the game forward, list of players with their characters and aspects...that's it.<br/>*D&amp;D? Rules summaries, references, initiative track, little monster boxes with vital combat information...<br/>*Mouse Guard? Now we're getting meaty, Season progression, Weather twists, GM-turn-Player-turn notes, Checks, Beliefs...<br/>*Apocalypse World (which I've recently read through) - this game already has something like it incorporated - you've got Fronts and Clocks and whatnot.<br/><br/>Nameless brings up the WHFRP3 Party Sheet, which is, I think another example how a game can make good use of "Sheets" of any kind, when they're incorporated into the mechanics. I have been thinking about putting stuff like this into my next game, but I'm not that far along to say for sure if it will make it.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, playsheets are aides, and maybe games should figure them in their whole design a little more (much like WHFRP3 did). We can have Setting Sheets, Cheat Sheets, Character Sheets, Theme Documents, GM Sheets, Party/Team Sheets, Adventure Sheets, Story Sheets...<br/><br/>If you consider this possibility when designing your game, you can end up with three or four or five sheets of paper on the table, that contain everything you need to play. No need to crack open the book during the game. The sheets can be evocative, nicely designed, they are tangible elements that can be manipulated and used much like dice, they can remind the players of the vital elements, of what the game is about etc.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irishvince" title="Irishvince"><img alt="Irishvince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/464/n77MQHB4WLBHG.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irishvince">Irishvince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252509/#Comment_252509" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T07:58:24+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  7:58AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know that there is an NPCs Management sheet floating around the internet(<a href="http://74.53.20.230/hammerzeit/index.php?option=com_phocadownload&amp;view=category&amp;id=2:utilities&amp;Itemid=54" rel="nofollow">Look for Monster Tracking Tool</a>) for WFRP3.

That way games which don't require prep or have other more unusual ways of using a GM can still make use of the reference side. And in any case, the GM can swap out the session side without needing to rewrite the persistent side.<br/><br/>In any case, this seems like one possible fix for RPGs which haven't adequately designed the role of the GM.

But what to my mind makes a sheet as described in the opening post wholly useful or not is whether the 3 act structure is being tacked on unnecessarily or whether it provides a much needed assist to the GM. From that perspective there are several classes of games, those that come to mind:<br/><br/>1) RPGs with strong or moderate GM authority and no overriding story structure - these are fairly traditional and will lend themselves well to a sheet which provides the GM with organization and story structure. By design many games (traditional and some indie) fall into this category - for example if I run GURPS Transhuman Space, Nobilis, or D&amp;D.<br/><br/>2) RPGs with strong or moderate GM authority and overriding story structure - the story structure here is a big issue, if it clashes with your sheet then you will find its helpfulness greatly diminished. Examples here include category (1) with story structure implanted by group consensus, or designed RPGs (usually indie games) like Dogs in the Vineyard or Prime Time Adventures. <br/><br/>3) RPGs with weak GM authority -  the story is as much in the hands of the players as the GM. In this case the planning part of the GM sheet will likely serve as a frustration, encouraging the GM to over plan the session and leaving little of the narrative described to occur. Examples here include some social contract versions of (2) and games like Inspectres. <br/><br/>4) RPGs with no GMs - it is unlikely you expect your GM sheet to help in these cases.<br/><br/>5) RPGs with multiple GMs - I think about this category because I'm currently designing in this space and some fascinating things arise here, especially in the case where the GMs are not fully coordinated, which results in a situation much like (3).<br/><br/>So, while I can imagine many games where this could work (if customized for a system), how much would this sheet need to be changed to be of comparable help to the GM of an Inspectres game?<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252705/#Comment_252705" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T17:24:24+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  5:24PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat idea; just the thing for a GM who's prepared to improvise heavily from a few rough notes.

All the stuff in section 4 is really nice for prep, but I wouldn't need it all in front of me during play unless my memory sucked.  I'm also fuzzy on scale.  If an Act is a whole adventure, I need more sub-parts.  If an Act is a scene, I need more Acts.  If an Act is in between (which is what I'm assuming), then I need a little of both.  Example: I have an adventure with 5 individual tasks.

How do I map that onto the sheet?<br/><br/>As for the flow chart, it would cover things like "bribe historian" and "interrogate cultist" both lead to "find hidden door", while "find hidden door" and "bribe historian" both lead to "interrogate cultist".  (You know where the monster is, and have maybe seen it, but want to know more about it before you fight it.)  Your empty rectangles might be sufficient, provided the chopping up into tasks (like "bribe historian") had already been done elsewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mordheim" title="mordheim"><img alt="mordheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.darkreign40k.com/drjoomla/images/comprofiler/tn62_47cea863027df.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mordheim">mordheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255667/#Comment_255667" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T03:09:11+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  3:09AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice sheet.

With your setup, it might read: Act 1 Find Castle (via Historian) (additional scene: Cultist); Act 2 Kill Monster (via hidden door); Act 3 Escape (players threatened by Lava flow upon Monster's death)(additional scene: also rescue princess before lava.)  Denouement: Historian hangs head in shame and informs party that princess was the hideous monster and the that slain hulk was in fact the hero's father).<br/><br/>You could also set up the Historian part as the Introduction and have that be the opener and then turn the "find the cultist" and ferret out additional info into your Act 1.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269710/#Comment_269710" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-02T09:31:18+00:00" title="May  2, 2010  9:31AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ok.  so the rough draft for phase 2 is sketched in.  the graphics and formatting still need a lot of TLC but the content should be mostly there.

Thanks for posting your sheets, dude.<br/><br/>FYI - Moon Designs has a GM aide pdf download for Heroquest.  It has the usual run of GM-screen tables, but what got my attention were the blank sections where you can track the try-fail history for each character and write down character-pertinent notes. They filled the last bit of space with a pretty diagram of the Hero's Journey, which actually does serve as a useful prompt for me, though YMMV.<br/><br/>My only critique of the very cool sheets posted here is that they strike me as dense, and I've found during a game that having a lot of tightly packed information spread in front of me ends up being more distracting than helpful.  I wouldn't find it necessary to write down the social contract and system, for instance--or much of the header info on p.1.  Some areas look pretty jammed.  For games where the characters have a shit-ton of magical items, it might be helpful to list the significant ones but not everything.<br/><br/>I really like the principles of play there in front of me, though again, I'd probably winnow them down to the five must-haves, and that'd  vary with individual GMs.  I want a sheet to focus my attention on the really significant info.  I'm less concerned about it being a comprehensive capture of everything about the players and the story.<br/><br/>The very last sheet on story details is the one I like the best, though it still seems overdense.  I'd prefer to break out one act at a time and provide a space on the right for notes taken in play.   But again, that's tailoring the sheet to someone with my particular set of preferences.  I often find myself jotting down quick notes in response to player decisions or events in-game, and linking a note section to portions of a streamlined cheat-sheet would work better for GMs like me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269719/#Comment_269719" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-02T11:28:05+00:00" title="May  2, 2010 11:28AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2010 11:31AM by Double King.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>the info for players 4,5 and 6 is a lot of wasted space.</blockquote>\nthanks JM.  the "how many" was a problem.  4/5 seemed to be the sweet spot but if you do 5, you've mostly got to do 6, right?  dunno.  Maybe i can take 6 out entirely.  I'd hoped to do different skins via pdf but thanks for reminding me that it could just be used to drop out uneeded cells entirely.  good catch!<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hexabolic</cite>GM aide pdf download for Heroquest. <br/><br/>My only critique of the very cool sheets posted here is that they strike me as dense.  ...I really like the principles of play there in front of me, though again, I'd probably winnow them down to the five must-haves, and that'd  vary with individual GMs. <br/><br/>...I often find myself jotting down quick notes in response to player decisions or events in-game, and linking a note section to portions of a streamlined cheat-sheet would work better for GMs like me.</blockquote>\nThanks for the notes Hexabolic.  I'll definitely take a peek at the Heroquest aide.<br/><br/>Re the other comments.  Yes.  I agree with you on all the points.  It might be trying too much to be too many different things all at once.  I'm trying to figure out essentials and redundancies.  Not certain how/what to take out of principles of play comments.  Some of that is graphics some of that is content.  It needs more finesse to be sure.<br/><br/>edit: a note on the front page: i think you'd said you would edit most or all of that out.  i think for ongoing stuff that would be fine to skip.  Originally, this was positioned for con-play or one shots where sitting at the table with the people and going over setting and coming up with some play-consensus might be warranted.  So, that's why that's there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
