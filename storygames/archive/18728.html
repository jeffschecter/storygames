I was wondering if I could get some help.  I'm making an fantasy OSR style game for the guys at my local gaming store down in Kentucky.  I want my sages to use spell books, but I want them to be something more than just a hard drive where incantations are stored and then loaded into the sage's RAM every morning (i.e. classic Vancian magic).  I want the spell books to be important- in the fiction and mechanically.  But I also don't want something that's overly complicated and involved.  It needs to quick and simple, but still... important.  I've been noodling on it for about three months now, and have come up with zero.  I'd appreciate any suggestions!  I'm at a loss <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420311/#Comment_420311" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-18T16:39:32+00:00" title="August 18, 2013  4:39PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ideas:<br/><br/>* Make damage-dealing spells a class ability, something you do with your staff -- a blast, with a look and feel in tune with your wizard. All other spells are rituals and take time. You can't memorize a ritual: you need it written down in a tome. No tome, no spell. (Maybe some are minor spells that you can perform the ritual ahead of time and keep a fetish to use it later, so you can do stuff like grease or entangle in combat.)<br/><br/>* Spell books aren't just paper and ink: they are living spirits bound into a book and you have to deal with them in order to cast spells. Not sure what you'd do mechanically here.<br/><br/>* In order to learn a spell, you have to write it down in blood in your own spell book. If anyone were to get their hands on your spell book and harm it, you will be harmed. If they burnt it up, well, you'd be burnt up too.<br/><br/>* Spell books are a lie, thought up by sham artists. Real spells are bound into gems and daggers and golden threads.<br/><br/>* The best spell book is your own skin. Get out those tattoo needles.

Sages transcribe a part of themselves into every spell in their book. Sages can use their book to tap into memories, as an anchor against mind-affecting magic, or possibly even as a self-resurrection device. The destruction of pages or even the entire tome may be required. (This isn't particularly quick or simple, but it what's occurred to me first.)<br/><br/>*A spell book acts as a map of a sage's life. Once a sage has been somewhere or learned a thing it can be referenced within the pages of the book. Even if a sage can't be sure which corridor was taken at the last fork, with a quick reference that information can be found in the spell book. If the sage wants to recall the faces of people present at a banquet many years ago, the spell book can call that memory forth in startling detail and clarity. (This is just a subset of the first idea, but easier to implement I imagine.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420319/#Comment_420319" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-18T19:59:49+00:00" title="August 18, 2013  7:59PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2013 8:00PM by JasonT.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * Spell books aren't just static records of spells \u2013\xa0they're full of notes sages made in the margins, like gestures that improve spell potency, crossed-out bits of rituals that turned out not to be necessary, snippets of ancient languages that can be slipped in while casting to alter effects, and so on. (From a mechanical perspective, this means that sages start play with a bunch of spells in their books already, but as they advance, they can alter in these very same ways:\xa0boosting damage/duration, substituting or eliminating components, creating variants of existing spells, etc.)<br/><br/>* Spell books confer upon their readers the ability to cast whatever is written on their pages at the moment they are first bound \u2013\xa0but only so long as the caster possesses the book. In this way, they are as precious to their owners as an expertly crafted sword is to a knight, for losing the book means losing its powers. If a sage happens to discover a new spell, simply transcribing it is not sufficient to use it; it must be properly bound into a spell book first, presumably by someone specially trained as an arcane bookbinder. (Mechanically speaking, this means you could get better with your spells like a warrior gets better with a sword, but spell selection is limited to what's in the book, and what you can read. If you want sages to be able to "gain" spells as they advance, you might say that they finally manage to translate a new page.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420327/#Comment_420327" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-18T21:26:58+00:00" title="August 18, 2013  9:26PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2013 9:27PM by Scrape.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *Easy, maybe less interesting version: casting from a spellbook instead of memory is slower but more potent.

There were spells in it, of course; fairly useless ones for summoning the ghosts of flowers, and some that he didn't even know what they were for such as the spell that rattled pots and caused cupboard doors to open and slam shut. A lesser spell could simply be a misunderstood more powerful spell: perhaps <i>Fly</i> couldn't be learned unless the wizard first learned <i>Levitate</i>; <i>Fire Arrow</i> might be necessary to eventually learn <i>Fireball</i>. <br/><br/>And then there's that one spell that Prospero had never dared use before because if you didn't get it out all in one breath it would destroy you. That's like giving the player a big red button that says "Do Not Push".<br/><br/> But there were  also general notes and maps. One could easily see a wizard's knowledge of obscure facts being tied to his book.  A map fragment, an old riddle, a drawing or partial description of a monster could all be helpful in an adventure and make the wizard more useful than just artillery and a utility belt. Entire adventure seeds could be culled from a handout sheet taken from the wizard's book. <br/><br/>Mechanically, books eat up initiative, require two hands and  concentration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420337/#Comment_420337" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-19T03:53:01+00:00" title="August 19, 2013  3:53AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread has some cool ideas although I suspect too complicated:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16408/make-stuff-spellbook-ideas/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16408/make-stuff-spellbook-ideas/p1</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420370/#Comment_420370" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-19T16:04:54+00:00" title="August 19, 2013  4:04PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            make familiars shapeshift into spellbooks, and make both part of the sage.

Here magic is a sort of wish, simple enough to "cast" in its own right, but evey wish interacts with every other wish you have ever made, which can produce unwanted side effects.  The safest thing to do is never to wish for anything, but if you must do it, the next safest thing is to write down what you did, and to consult that record every time you consider wishing for something else in the future.  Thus, experienced, necessarily cautious magicians have large tomes that they examine obsessively, not just when casting, but for for fear that there might some interaction they have hitherto overlooked that's going to come and bite them. All of this maps nicely onto the ideas that magicians spend their time in studies, that stealing their book would severely limit them, or why such works would be in some sort of code or cypher.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420679/#Comment_420679" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-25T04:16:46+00:00" title="August 25, 2013  4:16AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A wizard's spells are cast from a copy of the musings of the philosopher Melitifides, contained within a tome known as 'The Treasury'. The Spellbook. As the final test of their apprenticeship, a wizard is to reproduce the book from his master's copy, with 'The Treasury' acting not only as the source of their power, but also as a symbol of some significance within their community. A wizard without his Treasury is no true wizard at all. Some wizards claim these copies attract errors and subtle mistranslations, and that the original work would be a source of much greater power, should it ever be found.<br/>Magic is derived from the wizard's individual interpretations of the philosopher's often cryptic and ambiguous phrasings. The book has no chapters, nor verses, and even paragraph breaks vary between copies of the book, often lending radically different contexts and meanings to the passage a wizard must recite in order to cast a spell. As such, a wizard's personal views on the work of Melitifides will always shine through as the spells they cast take form. The same passage might be used by different mages to produce fire, wind, grease, sleep or even a tactile illusion. A mage is expected to read, contemplate and consider the passages within the text to pick up new spells as potential revelations of the inner working's of the original author's mind take form, or at least where the reader draws new extrapolations from the author's text. <br/>Some notable wizards have, in their own time, produced commentaries on the work. These commentaries often attempt to explain the works of Melitifides in much more straightforward, rigid terms. They contain magical power, no doubt, but the spells cast from them are much more fixed and determined in nature. Their passages cannot be interpreted so freely, and the colour of its magic is constrained to the mentality of the author, not of the reader.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420699/#Comment_420699" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-26T04:31:49+00:00" title="August 26, 2013  4:31AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any hedge magician can read out a few syllables from a book to achieve some minor effect.  But a true wizard knows spellcasting is a science of context.  Spells are not fixed immutably, but are instead re-woven with care to account for a multitude of factors:  the nature of the target, the exact effect required, and even the position of certain stars.  A wizards spellbooks are not simple lists of formulae as the uninitiated suppose--a wizard worth his salt can recite such formulae as a baker might recite the recipe for a certain type of bread.<br/><br/>No, a spellbook might be an almanack of facts useful to magecraft: names of significance, maps of ley lines, and astronomical observations.  It might also contain the musings and monographs of other wizards.  The wizard Mandacastar categorized all known spells into eight "schools"--and a wizard hoping to master a breadth of magical effects would benefit greatly from the insights in his writings.  The spellbooks of his unimaginative apprentice Bartleby consist of nearly four hundred spells that summon disembodied hands.  His work is a fascinating case study in how a wizard might achieve a vast variety of results by modifying the structure of the same basic spell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420708/#Comment_420708" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-26T08:03:52+00:00" title="August 26, 2013  8:03AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spellbooks are only useful for rituals.

You can cast from memory, and if you're very smart, you have a better chance of pulling it off, but using a spell book minimizes the chance of mistakes (and thus, weird, wild, and potentially dangerous side effects).<br/><br/>Mechanically speaking, this might be represented by a special Intelligence roll (or something along those lines) whenever you cast a spell, with a failed roll yielding a random result (from "spell just doesn't work" to "uh oh" *boom*).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ravenski" title="Ravenski"><img alt="Ravenski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ravenski">Ravenski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420720/#Comment_420720" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-26T15:35:35+00:00" title="August 26, 2013  3:35PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One system I found intriguing was in Harry Connolly's "Twenty Palaces" series of novels (Urban Fantasy/Mystery/Horror).  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Palaces" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Palaces</a>, the author's site: <a href="http://www.harryjconnolly.com/" rel="nofollow">harryjconnolly.com/</a>.<br/><br/>The basic premise is: there are really only 3 "true" spell books in the world (although they aren't really "spell books" the way we would think of them).  Anyone who accesses them becomes a "Primary", and can then transcribe spells into a "normal" spell book.  If you can access a "normal" spell book, you can make a copy of the spell(s) within it, but somehow those copies are less powerful than the previous copy, over and over down the line (until they become effectively useless).  So it doesn't just matter whether you have access to a spell, but how "pure" the copy is (in other words, how close it is to the original Primary's transcription).  This can create politics as well as plots to gain access to other's spell books to increase one's power.<br/><br/>Within that system, magic is generally ritual-based, although sometimes the rituals are used to create magic items (that may also vary in power, both in terms of the spell book that it came from, as well as whatever components you choose to utilize to make the item from -- without spoiling it, the main character makes an interesting choice here, which has both good &amp; bad implications for him down the line).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ravenski" title="Ravenski"><img alt="Ravenski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ravenski">Ravenski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420721/#Comment_420721" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-26T15:40:16+00:00" title="August 26, 2013  3:40PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and to follow-up, IIRC the original 3 "true" spell books are either hidden (by powerful entities) or lost, which makes the economy of "purer" spell books even more important.  If an older/purer spell books is lost or destroyed, there may be no way of regaining that level of power, without finding another source.

A couple ways to read this, if you were going to use it to inspire a game mechanic:<br/><br/>* The process of actually seeing and copying a spell imbues magic within the pages themselves. The purer the magic(al pages) you copy from, the more potent your own copy, kind of like making a copy of a copy of a cassette tape.<br/><br/>* The language of magic is complicated. Like, REALLY complicated. Like, you know how some people's handwriting makes it hard to tell the difference between an "o" and an "e"? Or, for that matter, how some fonts make it tricky to tell an uppercase "I" from a lowercase "l"? Well, imagine dealing with issues like these using a millennia-old magical language composed of nearly imperceptibly different runes, where individual characters are differentiated not just by shapes and lines but <i>thickness</i> of lines and <i>shades</i> of black in the ink. Transcription errors are practically to be expected \u2013\xa0meaning that the spells read from one book are simply going to be better than the "same" spells read from another book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Theophidian" title="Theophidian"><img alt="Theophidian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Theophidian">Theophidian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420743/#Comment_420743" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-27T07:27:22+00:00" title="August 27, 2013  7:27AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Think about the purpose of a spell book in your game.  Spell books can serve a number of purposes:<br/>1) Flavor.  Face it, giant tomes with metal clasps and tooled leather are just freaking cool.<br/>2) Single point of failure.  Mages usually need a weakness, and a spell book provides that.  It just matters how much you want mages to need it.<br/>3) Money and time sink.  Spell books are never complete, and they require study and interaction.<br/>4) A Governor.  Mages can pull out massive destruction and great utility.  Mechanics involving the spell book usually slow the mage down enough to make it fair to other classes.<br/>5) Transferable resource.  Spell books can be bought or stolen, and they provide the new owner with a certain amount of use.<br/><br/>Once you know how much of each purpose you want the book to provide, (and think of any purposes that I missed), you will have a clear picture of what you need for your story, and coming up with a mechanic that fits those needs is much easier than coming up with a mechanic that you like and hoping it fits the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ravenski" title="Ravenski"><img alt="Ravenski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ravenski">Ravenski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420755/#Comment_420755" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-27T09:47:18+00:00" title="August 27, 2013  9:47AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am partway into reading Howl's Moving Castle (the book by Diana W Jones, not the anime -- I haven't seen the anime yet, but I've read that it differs in some ways, so not sure if it's the same in this), and they had an interesting concept in that "advanced" spells in the spell books are basically encrypted -- they have hidden meanings in the writing that you have to puzzle out to get the spell to succeed, and if you don't know the secrets you may not be able to cast it (or will get a spectacular failure).  The reasoning being to prevent other mages (including your own nosy apprentices) from casting those spells, but to have them in a form that *you* can still understand.  When an apprentice has reached a certain level of aptitude, they are tasked with puzzling out such a spell, both as a means of determining whether they are "ready", and to train them to recognize the hidden meanings (at least, the hidden meanings for their particular master-mage, which means that you could have hierarchies of styles of such hidden meanings).<br/><br/>Note that I am only 1/3rd of the way into the book, so I don't know how this is going to play out, but in gameplay terms this means that there would be reasons to spend time researching newly found spell books.  You would probably be able to utilize low-level spells right away, but if you want to gain access to the powerful ones, you'd have to work on them, which could lead to other adventures (to rare libraries, to the original owning mage's contemporaries/apprentices/school he went to/etc.) in order to figure out the meanings of his spell book.  Having researched a mage's spell book would probably give you bonuses towards understanding other related mage's (master/apprentice) spell books.<br/><br/>On a similar front you could do something like the Earthdawn RPG (and others!) does where you can spend experience (or whatever economy you choose) to "bind" items to yourself, to simulate the research in a different way (without actual "adventures"), or if you wanted to do so to limit player access to powerful items (such as spell books) to prevent players from becoming too powerful.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ravenski" title="Ravenski"><img alt="Ravenski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ravenski">Ravenski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420756/#Comment_420756" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-27T09:54:11+00:00" title="August 27, 2013  9:54AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>* Spell books aren't just static records of spells \u2013\xa0they're full of notes sages made in the margins, like gestures that improve spell potency, crossed-out bits of rituals that turned out not to be necessary, snippets of ancient languages that can be slipped in while casting to alter effects, and so on.

While they avoid using magic (it being considered "evil"), the Spooks keep journals of every monster encounter they have, with journals dedicated to each monster "type", detailing everything that has been found out about that monster (strengths, weaknesses, known history/where they come from, etc.).<br/><br/>As part of his apprenticeship, Thomas has to write his own journals of each encounter they have, both as a means of training him, as well as giving him his own copies of the information for when he grows out of his apprenticeship.  He also has to copy his master's journals, although he is only allowed to do specific ones that are considered "safer" knowledge, at least initially.  The books do a good job of presenting the monsters, and at least in the ebook versions I have there are journal "entries" at the back from John Gregory, detailing whatever monster was the main focus of that book.<br/><br/>The journals are so important that having access to them often dictates success or failure.  While the master has gone head-to-head with a number of monsters (and thus has first-hand knowledge of them), there are such a variety that not having the journal could theoretically allow you to miss something.  And some of his journals were passed down to him from HIS master, so he may not have encountered everything from those.<br/><br/>The loss of those journals would be devastating, both for the master but particularly for the apprentice &amp; any future apprentices, as there is soo much knowledge there, covering hundreds of years of encounters, across a number of masters/apprentices.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Some more random thoughts (some of which have already been mentioned in parts): <br/><br/>If you consider spell books as granting some ability (whether it be base knowledge, actual ability to memorize spells or cast them directly, bonuses to casting, etc.), then it makes sense that there be downsides to them as well.  Often spell books are bulky/unwieldy, they can be stolen or damaged/destroyed (fire!), and they may contain rituals that aren't really usable outside of a specific environment (wizard's tower, alchemist's laboratory, etc.) or requiring lots of hard-to-store spell components.  Wizard's might have "travel" spell books with subsets of their spells, which could be replaced by copying from the base spell book, but that would take time.<br/><br/>Wizards could easily covet other wizard's spell books, forcing players to be very careful about who gets to see theirs (or even the fact that they have one with them).<br/><br/>Similarly, spell books are often trapped to prevent others from accessing them, anything from harming the viewer to destroying the spell book itself (for a similar gameplay effect as encrypting the text).  Players could go on adventures or research, learning how to circumvent such traps.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420781/#Comment_420781" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-27T14:49:05+00:00" title="August 27, 2013  2:49PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2013 2:58PM by creases.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Magic is extremely sensitive to prevailing astrological conditions.

For example, the book tells you what kinds of magic you can and cannot do at that particular place and time, so maybe you flat-out can't use any fire magic in the Dismal Swamps during the dark of the moon\u2026 but the dark magics of the druids are extra-efficacious, if you have the proper warding rituals, and here's what you'll need to find in the swamps to do so.<br/><br/>Recently Twitter revised how it displays conversations, which made me observe how Twitter has this odd flow-reversal built in: Twitter presents posts from newest to oldest, top to bottom, except for a conversation the flow reverses, with the oldest post on top. That led me to wonder whether anyone's done a bilingual novel in two different writing systems, for example English descriptions written left-to-right, top-to-bottom as convention, but Japanese dialogue written with Japanese characters in the traditional top-to-bottom, right-to-left flow. And <i>that</i> led me to these observations. We know that some concepts are very difficult if not impossible to fully explain in translation; there are words and phrases that only make sense in the original language. We also know that magic as a concept is not limited to any one particular culture or language, but there is a tendency in fantasy fiction and gaming to have a single "magic language". Well, toss that out. Spells and incantations come from a variety of sources, and must be written in the language and writing system in which they originated. A spell book is necessary because the method in which the spell is written is as much a part of knowing how to cast it as simply remembering what the words mean or how to pronounce them. <br/><br/>I'm not sure how useful that concept would be mechanically, beyond something simple like the Dungeon-World-style "take their stuff" drawback (no spell book, no spell casting), but it seems like a strong fictional reason why you'd have and carry around a spell book all the time. Heck, maybe a spell book is actually a primer on writing multiple languages, and a lexicon, which means not only are wizards able to cast spells but they're also experts in translating a variety of languages, which could be vital for tomb-robbing-style dungeon delving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420857/#Comment_420857" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-29T06:25:26+00:00" title="August 29, 2013  6:25AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spellbooks might not only be important for reading but also as notes the wizard keeps:<br/><br/>- A spellbook might be a good way to keep observed magic that is cast in some language you do not speak with complicated gestures, just writing that down as precise as possible might give you a chance to later do that spell yourself or decifer it. Maybe you need more than one record to piece it together. So notes as a way to reverse egineer spells the sage witnesses during his or her travels.<br/><br/>- In an age of enlightment like setting it might be an Encyclop\xe9die in the works in some wizard academy or other center of learning and each sage following this philosophy is out there trying to complete the knowledge of magic and collect it in one place. Taking notes and refining them as he travels to later put it into the ultimate almanac of magic.<br/>Or maybe the sage is carrying a copy of an allready existing Encyclop\xe9die and is adding notes over time, seeing what is helpful and what isn't.<br/><br/>- Like modern day universities schools of magic might want their wizards to publish and thus a travelling sage will take notes of his or her research and magic. Putting it into a Thesis sometimes and getting rewarded by his academy. Other peoples scientific writings of course would be available for study too.<br/><br/>- If magic is conjured by speaking it's own powerful tongue and spells need to be prepared for the moment a spellbook might just be a safe way to do so. Just writing down what you will say before you do so, because every little mistake might cause some big trouble. So a notebook, that you of course keep if similar situations arise and also a dictionary.<br/><br/>It makes a difference too on what technology level the creation of books is in your game world. And, as in the Encyclop\xe9die example, what philosophies are popular at the moment.<br/><br/>-In a more Dark Ages setting a book would be a thing of real value and possibly a work of art in the writing and illustration alone. The parchment is expensive and maybe it is important that it comes from special magical animals. The illumination with magical metals could be just as important and if a spellbook is lost as a unique piece the spells in it might be lost forever as well. But copying is hard and expensive work few are able to do. With literacy on a low even being able to write and read is a special skill and the wizards maybe wouldn't use much encryption.<br/><br/>- For a more Renaissance like setting where an ancient culture influences the current one and their works are in use again, old tomes of magic could have a renaissance. Maybe they are flawed transcriptions and need to be corrected or updated over time. Maybe some stars and leylines that were assumed before changed position and now the spells do not work exactly as written. Maybe the knowledge of the falle empire is written on stone tablets and temple walls and the book is a way to transcribe it.<br/><br/>- If the printing press allready is invented and cheap paper made from rags available that could lead to magic in the hands of many people. If reading and performing a spell from a book is enough to have it work. But printing a bad or flawed spell might cause great troubles when people start raising the dead all over instead of making their crops grow. Different publishers could have build in flaws in their spells, maybe they never can target one of the members of their secret order or each use strengthens a magical ritual.<br/>Finding a new spell and getting it published could be a source of money or influence. But the publishers might hound wizards know for unique spells too, trying to steal them maybe. Of course some might want to reduce the knowledge of magic too and try to close printing presses or at least supress magic. Some for egoistic reasons others maybe only to stop that ritual to summon cthulhu.<br/>A spellbook in such a world might be a collection of printings with notes and additions. More of a scrapbook than an ancient scroll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420865/#Comment_420865" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-29T10:18:08+00:00" title="August 29, 2013 10:18AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...<br/>As part of his apprenticeship, Thomas has to write his own journals of each encounter they have, both as a means of training him, as well as giving him his own copies of the information for when he grows out of his apprenticeship.

A wizard's spell book has a primitive copy of that wizard's own personality imprinted on it which will interact with anyone trying to access the book. This means that while the creator of the spell book finds it easier to search their own spell book, anyone else would experience a mental attack by the book.<br/><br/>Books of Magic tend to get stronger and more aware the older they are and the more potent the knowledge they contain is, so a young wizard would have a book that might be able to distract others trying to read it, making it harder to use and giving you a migraine if you keep trying for an extended period, while an Archmage's book might be able to destroy your mind, possess you or even cast some of the spells it contains through you while you read it. <br/><br/>Some are subtle, and try to keep their reader from realizing that anything is happening to them until it is too late, influencing the information the reader finds, making them miss key warnings or explanations, worming quietly into their heads to make them mutter the words of a spell that will summon some spirit to attack them, or similar things. Others are more blatant, throwing their will against the reader to cause pain or invade their thoughts and memories.<br/><br/>In a chronicle that I ran a while ago a young priest came into possession of a spellbook created by one of the most potent necromancers in that setting's history. This led to him having several mental conversations with the very developed mind within the book, suffering very real hallucinations that made the conversations more real to him. Eventually, after this had been going on for several weeks, they wound up in a fight where he suffered terrible injuries to his soul and was dying, only to be saved by the intelligence of the book taking over his mind and casting several spells on him, both to prevent his death and to dominate and destroy those he was fighting. Led eventually to him resisting its growing influence over him and trying to burn it, only to have the book vanish, leaving the logs frozen solid.<br/><br/>Of course part of this is probably just my inner librarian insisting that librarians being more awesome, since it means that they people who deal with collections of documents about or containing magic have to do battle with the books on a regular basis to extract the information they seek.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420963/#Comment_420963" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-02T00:51:56+00:00" title="September  2, 2013 12:51AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Take a page (tee hee) from Hellraiser and Planescape: Torment's "Circle of Zerthimon": the information you need to cast high-level, impressive spells isn't just tied to an object, it's an object that's also a puzzle, because if you're not smart enough to work out what parts need to slide where in order to see how to cast the spell, you're not smart enough to cast it.</blockquote>Comparing a spell to a rubik's cube suggests to me an interesting though:<br/><br/>I know one way of solving a rubik's cube.

Astrological conditions and locations, ley lines, places of power, new information and strange encounters, what needs to be changed in one spell to change its effect, a list of conditions on top of conditions, workable substitutions, and the accumulated magic magical effects on each book.<br/><br/>So each wizard would start with a very basic spell book that is also an almanac and bestiary and a knowledge of magical theory. Then as the wizard adventures notes are made on spells, new monsters, the affect of astrology and location on the spells. Different locations and times would give both wizards and magical creatures different effects so the wizard would make notes of sightings and battles. You might start with a Fireball spell, modify it to a Firebolt, and then to a cold bolt. No one could understand one spell without having worked through the whole progression.<br/><br/>When two wizards meet you would both be correlating sitings, sharing information, seeing how far a ley line extends or where it intersects another. Perhaps try to work out a spell that was cast once but could not be duplicated.<br/><br/>Caravans of wizards travel the world cataloging and experimenting as they go. When they reach a tower or university they begin a trade in spells and information, openly if they are affiliated in some way or guarded and full of suspicion if not. To let others look at your spellbook and you theirs is the best way but what if there is an accident or some subtle sabotage? Are those you meet being honest? Or even competent enough to help you?<br/><br/>Perhaps there are libraries where traveling spellbooks are collected and cross referenced, sifted for truth, and refined so each spells can be learned and used independently. You could trade access of your spellbook(s) to the library for access to the library. They might send out groups of wizards to confirm or fill in gaps of knowledge. I can see this like Arse Magika but instead of each coven being secretive and isolated they must trade and travel; leave the safety of home more often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ravenski" title="Ravenski"><img alt="Ravenski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ravenski">Ravenski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421031/#Comment_421031" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-03T11:23:44+00:00" title="September  3, 2013 11:23AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Take a page (tee hee) from Hellraiser and Planescape: Torment's "Circle of Zerthimon": the information you need to cast high-level, impressive spells isn't just tied to an object, it's an object that's also a puzzle, because if you're not smart enough to work out what parts need to slide where in order to see how to cast the spell, you're not smart enough to cast it.</blockquote>Comparing a spell to a rubik's cube suggests to me an interesting though:<br/><br/>I know one way of solving a rubik's cube.  It's not the fastest, most efficient way, but it's a way that's easy to remember and hard to screw up.  If spells were like puzzles, perhaps there are optimum and non-optimum ways to cast them.  What if a widely circulated copy of a fireball spell required you to chant twelve magic syllables but an efficient version required only five.  Or required different amounts of mana expenditure, etc.</blockquote>\n<br/>I like the concept of having varying levels of "efficiency" for spells, although it could get hard to manage in a pencil &amp; paper environment.  It relates to some old ideas I had for a component-based magic system, where you could build spells out of the components almost like a form of computer programming, but with very few magic-users aware of the specifics (or even that there *is* an underlying system).  You would have to train for a long time just to *start* learning about the underlying "ways of magic" (i.e., the components), and even then you would have to learn each of the components and how they interrelate to each other in order to make your own spells.  But the GM could have a list of variations of spells, some perhaps with secondary effects (this magic missile throws off firework effects) that may be undesired/cost more, or others that are just barebones, optimized ones that cost less to cast (assuming you have some sort of mana system beyond traditional "vancian-style" magic).  And different spell books / mages could potentially have access to different versions.<br/><br/>So there could be advantages of finding another mage's spell book, as they might have a more optimized version of a spell you already know, or they might have one with some secondary effect that you find particularly useful (this fireball also blinds everyone for x rounds).  Perhaps some of the common spells happen to be inefficient because they were easily found in popular spell books, while more prudent mages kept their "better" versions hidden for themselves.  Apprentices might be taught inefficient versions at first, to keep them in awe of their masters.  Failed apprentices, with the inefficient versions in their spell books, would be at a disadvantage.<br/><br/>Theoretically you could utilize the components for spell failures too, with the "proximity" between components in combination with the severity of the spell failure causing you to miscast into other components.  Perhaps you could then guess at what kind of spell someone else is casting, if that spell uses similar components.  On the management extreme, the GM could potentially keep skill scores for each underlying component for the player, with higher skills perhaps giving advantages (lower cost, faster casting, etc.), better ability for detecting those components in other's magic, or as requirements for creating new spells.  Theoretically you could have each component have some form of individual mana cost, but with the ability to substitute other sources for that cost, such as with spell components.  You might find a spell book that points out that you can use mandrake root to pay some of the cost for a particular spell for instance, leaving you with more mana left over (or if you aren't using a mana-based system, you could have it make the spell more effective -- more damage, longer duration, etc.).<br/><br/>But again, this goes into unmanageable territory for a pencil &amp; paper game.  Some aspects of it would work better for a computer game, but then you would lose some of the fun &amp; flexibility of having it as a p&amp;p.  Perhaps it might work in a limited/simplified form however, just using general classifications (Elemental vs Enchantment vs ... spells).<br/><br/>Perhaps this is starting to get to the edge of the bounds of the original post, however.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ravenski" title="Ravenski"><img alt="Ravenski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ravenski">Ravenski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421032/#Comment_421032" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-03T11:40:44+00:00" title="September  3, 2013 11:40AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I like the ideas of spellbooks being notes.

It would make sense to have certain types of "spell books" that you would keep at home vs ones you might travel with, and there could be advantages gained beyond just a spell you could cast.  "This spell book gives you +2 on ritual type casting of type  spells, but requires certain equipment, drawn sigils, and quiet" vs "this one has the method for casting magic missile to refresh your memory".<br/><br/>A wizard's spell book could contain information about their past creatures encountered, traps that they have set, locations of potential magical components, etc.  One on magical theory could instruct a new mage apprentice in how to create a basic wizard's staff/wand (magical only in the sense that it can be used to extend the user's reach for "touch" spells).  It could be that without a basic "magical theory" text, a new mage would be at a disadvantage casting even basic spells, which would lend more reason for them to go into apprenticeships.  These could either be hand-specified pieces of information by the GM, intending to lead into future adventures, or they could act as a bonus for certain skill checks ("do I know where to find sulphur or mandrake root?").<br/><br/>There could be "themed" spell books too, as with roguelikes and some p&amp;p games, where you might have a spell book devoted only to summoning spells, or to fire, knowledge, etc.<br/><br/>If spells are considered rare, it would make sense for an apprentice mage's master to perhaps leave them with a subset of their own spells, to keep an advantage for the future (perhaps for trade down the line, or in case of a turncoat apprentice, including the apprentice perhaps trying to take the spells to a rival master mage, in exchange for what they perceive as a "better" apprenticeship).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421042/#Comment_421042" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-03T14:48:05+00:00" title="September  3, 2013  2:48PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2013 2:48PM by David Artman.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It relates to some old ideas I had for a component-based magic system, where you could build spells out of the components almost like a form of computer programming, but with very few magic-users aware of the specifics (or even that there *is* an underlying system).
