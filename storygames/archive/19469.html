It was me and two players in a oneshot, since we didn\u2019t want to continue the regular campaign with two players missing.<br/><br/>The guide is usable from start to finish, so I basically started reading from the top and summarized the text to the players. There\u2019s a system-agnostic \u201cnow go make characters\u201d step where we rolled up the two Whitehack characters. The players rolled a midshipman (11 years old!) and the captain. They rolled really high on crew and officers as well, 29 crew members and 11 officers. They were 7 days (14 hexes) away from Carrion (I used the same name as Greysands). They named the ship Medusa.<br/><br/>When we rolled for cargo we couldn\u2019t figure out the first result:\n<blockquote>36. impossibly fast, metal hulled coastal cutter</blockquote>\nWere they transporting it? Was it their own ship that was the cutter? We re-rolled a couple of times instead:\n<blockquote>28. a dentist<br/>15. exotic hardwoods<br/>04. breeding pair of giant sheep</blockquote>\nThe captain was of the Wise class, which means he got a miracle (i.e. spell) from the start. He chose \u201cControl weather\u201d as he had been touched by Poseidon. The captain was the leader of a Poseidon cult, with a large part of the crew as members. Six of the crew were armed mercenaries.<br/><br/>I printed a large hex map on four A4 sheets and put in the middle of the table, with a coastline and Carrion to the east and the Medusa 14 hexes away. On hex 2 they had their first encounter, an island:\n<blockquote>6. A ship made on a Giant's scale has broken on a reef. What extraordinary and oversized things will be found inside? What impractical cargo has survived?</blockquote>\nThe wrecked ship was half submerged. I decided that the giants had been ten times as tall as humans, with the ship built to that scale. With 2 meter humans, that\u2019s 20 meter giants. They sent over a smaller boat to investigate and found the crew dead and turned to (peaceful) skeletons. The PCs decided to bring a giant skull as a souvenir. I rolled for the cargo and it was:\n<blockquote>25. coffins full of dirt</blockquote>\nThey spent an hour fictional time breaking open and investigating the crates. The players suspected that the dirt either was packing material (but they couldn\u2019t find anything packaged) or magical. They brought some with them to Medusa\u2019s clerk to investigate, and a player rolled his intelligence (3d6: 8; NO!) and I rolled his skill roll (5; yes!). The clerk Elbet used a newly developed method called the \u201cscientific\u201d and dissolved the dirt in different fluids, and determined that it was normal dirt.<br/><br/>They moved on, and the next encounter was:\n<blockquote>7. The wind changes. A portent! Perhaps something strange blows in on this new wind? Hot air from the south carrying silvery powder that coats everything, a damp breeze filled with acrid spores that stain the sails or unseasonal cold/heat with snow and sleet/ashes and cinders. There's a strong chance that these droppings could put the crew to sleep, or leave and take the wind with them - becalming the ship for 1d6 days.</blockquote>\nThe north-eastern wind turned to wind from the south carrying silver dust. Anyone who breathed it in, which they all did, fell asleep for 1d6 days. One of the players quickly ordered half the crew below deck before his PC fell asleep, but I decided that even the ones who were below deck would try to help their comrades during the following day and fall asleep. The captain slept for one day and the midshipman for three days. The ship drifted randomly two hexes before the captain and \u2159 of the crew woke up, feeling really refreshed as after a perfect night\u2019s sleep. They drifted backwards, away from Carrion. We rolled encounters as they entered new hexes, which could have ended up really bad if they were attacked while asleep. It turned out that in the second hex they found another giant shipwreck!<br/><br/>This time the ship was carrying:\n<blockquote>40. oil</blockquote>\nI decided that it was giant barrels of black crude oil. I thought about using olive oil, but went with the black stuff, even though I don\u2019t know how they would\u2019ve extracted it and what kinds of processing of the oil is needed to use it as fuel, and so on. The players wanted to bring a barrel with them, perhaps towing it after the Medusa. After some discussion I used the whiteboard in the room we were playing in and drew a stick figure two meters tall with a one meter barrel next to him. Then I drew a 20 meter tall stick figure with a 10 meter tall barrel next to him. One giant barrel would equal 1000 human barrels. They were huge! The players had to give up and move on. The captain was very sad to see these riches left behind.<br/><br/>It\u2019s interesting that the scenario says that the ship already has cargo, so there\u2019s no real motivation for the characters to search for and loot cargo. They could still swap the cargo of course, if they think the new cargo is more valuable, and they\u2019re prepared to rip off their original customer.<br/><br/>One thing that\u2019s not clear from the scenario is if you roll a new encounter for already explored hexes. I guess you could, because you can always find new stuff, but it\u2019s also nice if you know that this hex is where the giant shipwreck is, and not add stuff if you go back and forth through the hex. We decided to not roll new encounters.<br/><br/>The next encounter, after a couple of hexes, was:\n<blockquote>13. A fog bank rolls in. Visibility is nil and there is some terrible danger ahead for sure. Perhaps it's a terrible shoal or sandbank with a mysterious isolated lighthouse, a series of 100-foot granite needles jutting out of the sea, or a place where  the crust of the Earth has given way and the Ocean drains into an abyss.</blockquote>\nI went with 100-foot black stone needles. This was at night. The players didn\u2019t order a slow down as they entered the fog, so I had them roll a 1 in 6 risk that they sailed straight into a needle. The missed it, and order lowering of the sails and putting out the anchor. I let the sail carefully through the 30 needles, so they didn\u2019t have to roll any more. The players joked about rolling SAN loss, as the encounter felt Lovecraftian. We decided that they were going to Carrion for the first time, so there was no chance that they knew about these fantastic things before.<br/><br/>The next encounter was:\n<blockquote>11. An undersea vehicle is spotted, surfaces and hails the ship! It could be Nemo's Nautilus, a Mer-chariot or a starbeast vessel.</blockquote>\nIt may seem like there\u2019s a lot of encounters, but it's not strange since there\u2019s a 1 in 6 chance to hit an island and 1 in 3 to hit an encounter. I think it\u2019s good; less than that and the scenario will turn boring. It was also at night, so they only spotted a light. I decided it was humanoids travelling inside a living giant reptile, that had see-through membranes along the sides that worked like windows. The players didn\u2019t get to know this as they avoided the ship. I rolled their attitude on 1d6, where 1-2 were openly hostile and 5-6 was friendly, with 3-4 being \u201ca little\u201d of either. I don\u2019t remember the exact roll, but they were hostile and went for the Medusa, but I only let them catch the Medusa on a 1 in 6, which they failed.<br/><br/>The next encounter:\n<blockquote>10. A bottle on the waves. Perhaps it contains a message, a map, a potion, a small magic ring, a tiny model of your own ship, a ghost or a genie?</blockquote>\nThis one was hard. It was at night and they were going at full speed, so how would they notice a bottle from their big ship? I asked if they stopped at any time for some reason, and would\u2019ve let them find the bottle then, but they didn\u2019t want to. I actually did a weird 1 in 6 roll here, where I said that on a 2-6 the players wouldn\u2019t even know what the encounter was and on 1 I\u2019d tell them OOC and we\u2019d figure out how they got the bottle onboard. They didn\u2019t roll a 1, so I didn\u2019t tell them what they missed until after the session. This is a potential problem with this encounter as written, compared to the others.<br/><br/>Next encounter:\n<blockquote>6. A flying monster circles the ship, perhaps curious or preparing to attack. It could be Stirges, the Roc, Giant Albatrosses, an Air Elemental or a Sea Drake. Monster reaction as normal.</blockquote>\nThe Roc. It has stats in Whitehack, so it was convenient (HD 12, AC 4, Move 50 feet/turn). I rolled a 3 on my improvised reaction table, so it was hostile, but wouldn\u2019t fight unless it had to. I decided that it protected it\u2019s nest, and the players were all too happy to avoid a fight.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433095/#Comment_433095" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T03:37:22+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  3:37AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2014 12:32PM by Jonas Ferry.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The last encounter, close to Carrion:\n<blockquote>14. Pirates. A terrible black ship on the horizon. Evade or prepare to be boarded.</blockquote>\nWe had already decided that ships would have hull points (hp, conveniently enough). All ships would be rated on a level scale similar to PCs, from 1 to 10, smallest possible to largest possible. The Medusa was a level 5 ship, and had 5d6 hull points (17). The pirate ship was a level 3 ship and had 3d6 hp (11). I had also decided that most ship-sized attacks would do 1d6 of damage, say a roc or enemy cannons (yes, we had gunpowder). Since they were a pirate ship, they had enough cannons for 2d6, while the Medusa did 1d6. The first volleys did 6 damage to the pirates (down to 5 hp) and 4 damage on the Medusa (down to 13).<br/><br/>The second volleys did 2 damage to the pirates (down to 3 hp) and 12 damage (!) on the Medusa (down to 1 hp). The pirates retreated, as they didn\u2019t want to get stuck here. We had decided that 0 hp didn\u2019t mean that the ship sunk, it would be similar to 0 hps for PCs. PCs are unconscious at 0 hp and any further damage requires a death save. We decided that ships would float, but be unusable, at 0 hp, and any further damage would sink it.<br/><br/>The players traveled the last few hexes to Carrion and the session ended. We were out of time, so we didn\u2019t sell the cargo or award XP.<br/><br/>I'll add some more observations to the thread later, but I wanted to get this out to keep Mike from waiting any longer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433097/#Comment_433097" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T04:42:53+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  4:42AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some observations:<br/><br/>* Whitehack has no sea travel or sea combat rules, so I had to make up the above on the spot, based on my experiences as a player in the Silent Dusk IRC game. I've since learned that there's a sea section in the B/X Expert rules that I can use in the future.<br/><br/>* Whitehack also has no morale or reaction rules, so all monster and NPC reactions are up to the GM to decide. One thing I would have benefited from would've been a crew morale table or similar. Since the risk of mutiny is built into the scenario thanks to the XP rewards, it would be nice to get some help with the general sentiments of the crew. Are they happy, content, or mutinous?<br/><br/>* I had no rules for food and water. This can be added to the scenario to create a sense of urgency. If it's a separate random roll from the number of days from port you can get either a doomsday clock ticking down which prevents large detours, or the realization that you have to find an island for fresh water.<br/><br/>* I hurried through the scenario. This was both because it was a one shot and because that's my GM style at the moment; to move things ahead quickly and not get bogged down. But that way you miss exploring the world around you in more detail. It would've been nice to slow down and have a look at what goes on during a typical day on the ship; what happens at dinner, and so on.<br/><br/>* I didn't play the NPC crew as much as I should. I left them mostly to the players, which is fine, but I missed the chance to use the crew's reactions to events to put pressure on the players.<br/><br/>* Whitehack does have a list of suggested names, so the NPCs were all named from that list. Very convenient.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433100/#Comment_433100" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T06:04:51+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  6:04AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat!

My PC sided with the captain and the other PC tried to start the mutiny. I think we rolled 50% for each member of the crew to see who they sided with, and the captain's side won; so no mutiny that time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433137/#Comment_433137" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T12:30:03+00:00" title="May 28, 2014 12:30PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2014 12:30PM by Jonas Ferry.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Did you roll for the impending situation?

It's worth mentioning, though. I also rolled a storm, and with no specific suggestions in the scenario I used the idea from the Silent Dusk game; a storm a few hexes big that moved on the map. I put it between the Medusa and Carrion the specified number of days away, and moved it one hex southwest each time the ship moved, but it was really easy for the players to sail around it. A player suggested I should roll the direction of the storm randomly, which I did for a while until it was impossible for it to catch up. The scenario says it's "threatening", but I had no idea how to handle if the ship was caught by the storm. Probably some damage rolls to the ship.\n<blockquote>Things like the oil -- even if there's no room to bring it in, provide opportunities for ongoing play.  Consider the value and be sure that a salvage operation is in the works...</blockquote>\nTrue. The two giant ships were also very atmospheric, so they were nice encounters in themselves.\n<blockquote>The bottle could have come up in a bucket of sea-water collected to swab the decks.  Or in a net full of fish.  I think I would have assumed that if it's an "encounter" then you sort of have to encounter it, so I'd figure out the why and how.  (Unless I had some reason, of course.)</blockquote>\nThose are great suggestions. In the IRC channel people suggested that a member of the crew could've found a glowing bottle in the cargo, among other suggestions. In retrospect it's easy for me to see lots of alternatives, but at the table I locked in completely on the phrase "A bottle on the waves". I think that if the encounter was slightly rephrased to include these suggestions I would've used the encounter right away. I also agree that an encounter should mean that *something* involving a bottle should happen, but that's a lesson for the future.\n<blockquote>Did the captain ever use his Control Weather miracle?</blockquote>\nHe did! The Medusa and the pirate ship sailed into the same hex, and the captain used his weather miracle to blow the pirate ship to the side. They would still occupy the same hex, but the PCs would get a chance to sail past them and escape. In Whitehack miracles cost hp. The cost is set by the GM, but the player can negotiate to increase or decrease the hp cost by adding or removing qualifiers. Perhaps the miracle requires a to-hit roll; then it's cheaper. Perhaps the victim can't save, then it's more expensive. You also take the caster's level into account, and so on. I decided that to hold the pirate ship up to sail by was a 1d6 hp miracle, and the player rolled a 6, out of 7 hp. I think I gave the pirates a 1 in 6 chance to catch up with the players, which they did, and the battle ensued.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433139/#Comment_433139" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T13:17:40+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  1:17PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The cult of Poseidon thing is ripe for sacrifices to the sea god.

And to have some, but not all, of the crew be members of the cult also had a lot of potential. Especially since the cult leader actually could perform miracles, and quite valuable miracles when you're on a ship. How would the non-believers react? Alas, I didn't utilize the NPCs' reactions to events. I've promised myself to do better next time I GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433141/#Comment_433141" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T13:43:26+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  1:43PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2014 1:43PM by Jonas Ferry.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The player characters:\n<blockquote><i>Klavander the Red, Level 1 Wise Captain</i><br/>Str 7, Dex 10, Con 11, Int 13, Wis 9, Cha 16 (Poseidon); HP 7, AC 9, ST 15, Move 9 m, To-hit: 0; Miracles: Control Weather; Pistol, Sword.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Astel, Level 1 Deft Midshipman</i><br/>Str 8, Dex 11, Con 7, Int 13 (Seafarers), Wis 10, Cha 12; HP 6, AC 6, ST 14, Move 8 m, To-hit: 0; Attuned to: Crossbow; Crossbow, Short sword, Studded Leather Armor.</blockquote>\nI had another moment where I felt like I was to harsh on the Deft PC. At the pirate attack he wanted to light a crossbow bolt on fire, fire it onto the pirate ship, and hit a powder keg. My first thought when a Deft character wants to do something with an attuned object is to let them succeed automatically, but my only idea at the time was that as a result of the explosion the pirate ship would sink. If it was <i>that</i> easy to sink ships everyone would have a Deft character on board!<br/><br/>So I called for a to-hit roll vs AC 9, even though he was attuned to the crossbow. He missed, so we didn't have to consider the consequences. The player said afterwards that he was thinking it would do 1d6 of hull point damage to the pirate ship, same as a cannon, which seems about right. Since Deft character can only use their attunement once per day it wouldn't be overpowered to let him do this, especially with a to-hit roll. The Deft are supposed to be able to do spectacular things, so it's not nice to limit them too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
