You will never be welcome in the Vale again."<br/><br/>Littlefinger says, "I'll do you one better. If I fail, I will be caught in Lisa Tully's bedchambers, and her husband can execute me right then. In exchange, I want her to poison him and vow to marry me that evening."<br/><br/>GM says, "That's fair enough, but beware: even if you succeed, people will whisper rumors about your sudden matrimony."<br/><br/>Littlefinger says, "No dice. I want this to be a clean affair. There can be no rumors about me that could make a mess of things. I'll take a -1 to my roll to make it happen."<br/><br/>GM says, "Okay. So you're going to roll at -1 to get Lysa Tully into poisoning her husband and quickly marrying you without any negative rumors.

(The ideal, rather, was for one player to state their desired outcome, and then their opponent to state theirs; but of course often players would need to negotiate a little to make that work, as in your example.)<br/><br/>An example of cross-pollination of that approach into D&amp;D:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/4311/ryan-stoughtons-raising-the-stakes-hack-for-d20" rel="nofollow">story-games.com/forums/discussion/4311/ryan-stoughtons-raising-the-stakes-hack-for-d20</a><br/><br/>Some other examples:<br/><br/><i>The Shadow of Yesterday/Solar System</i> has an interesting wrinkle where you can effecively skip your turn in order to change your desired outcome.<br/><br/><i>Polaris</i> makes the negotiation you describe *the resolution system*, and operates via ritual phrases.<br/><br/><i>In a Wicked Age...</i> flips this upside down, with the conflict taking place, and then the winner negotiating with the loser to determine what the loss actually means. (Some people referred to it as the "coercion engine" once upon a time.)<br/><br/>I like to fool around with this kind of thing in rulesets like <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20681/burned-at-the-stake-rpg-ruleset-for-passionate-characters-at-risk" rel="nofollow">Burned at the Stake</a> (you'll see that the negotiation in this case is more one-sided, however).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465386/#Comment_465386" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-08T23:02:43+00:00" title="August  8, 2017 11:02PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It fell out of favour, I think, after being overused in game after game after game (and it became "fashionable" to avoid this kind of design after a while), but I think it's an excellent mechanic and should be brought back more often than it is by designers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465389/#Comment_465389" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-09T00:43:26+00:00" title="August  9, 2017 12:43AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds a lot like <i>Polaris</i>, really. It's one of the few stakes-setting games that has explicit back-and-forth, followed by the dice roll (only if you don't settle without it). The other games on Paul's list are very relevant as well.<br/><br/>As Paul says, stakes-setting has seen a downturn since say 2006 or so. It has one big technical issue that is possible to work around with better game texts and such, but that used to be something of a problem when it was more common: when doing stakes-setting, you absolutely, positively need to be able to dinstinguish how the game in question treats out-of-character events as conflict stakes, and whether players are supposed to vie for authorial control or to advocate for their characters.<br/><br/>For example, a common misplay with a stakes-setting system is to declare stakes that your character has no way to struggle for in the conflict:<br/><br/><b>"I want to conflict about world peace. If I win, all war in the world stops over the next few weeks, just like that. Why settle for less."</b><br/><br/>Which is, of course, not a misplay at all if the game you're playing is supposed to work this way. Most stakes-setting games aren't, they still assume that conflict scope is bounded by the fictional leverage the character has to achieve things.<br/><br/>The other big misplay is the one where the players mistakenly believe that they should be authorial instead of advocating, or vice versa:<br/><br/><b>"My character wants to escape, of course, but I think it's boring, so if I win I want him to be recaptured and tortured."<br/><br/>"I know that it's too soon to resolve the overall conflict, but this is what my character would do: my stakes is to kill the bastard here and now."</b><br/><br/>Both of these issues differ from game to game, you cannot just switch habits over blindly. I believe that problems with these issues (particularly with authorial play intruding where advocacy was desired, and out-of-scope stakes where tight scopes were desired) contributed much to the decline in the popularity of raw stakes-setting.<br/><br/>Still, stakes are regularly featured in new games as well, they just get moderated in various ways. The terminology has become slightly more careful; a newer game will generally talk about "character goal" instead of "stakes", precisely because it helps clarify the above issues. Most of the time it's the same thing, though.<br/><br/>As an example, the recent <i>Tales of Entropy</i>, which is a bit of a throw-back to classic Forge era, does stakes-setting straight, in the most common form: when a conflict is recognized to occur, the players talk out the stakes (as in, what is at stake and what outcomes are desired by each party in the conflict) and only continue with the conflict process once they agree on the stakes of the conflict. The conflict process itself is completely universal, you do the same things regardless of what the stakes happen to be. At the end the winner provides the finishing flourish for the conflict outcome, whatever it ended up being.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Green" title="Green"><img alt="Green" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Green">Green</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465547/#Comment_465547" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-12T07:52:22+00:00" title="August 12, 2017  7:52AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Had a wagering system with <i>Kathanaksaya </i>when I was working on it.

Players place bets on which question they want to answer during card play. Then the selected question is pursued to an answer in a scene. Basically we are discovering why and how our characters ended up in a desperate make it or break it attempt to get a bunch of money.  The characters with the most money at the end of the game get a happy or at least successful epilogue with respect to their desperate situation. The poorest character meets with dire consequences and the in between characters have mixed endings.  Let me know and I'll share it with you when I'm done. Although im guessing you had been considering different uses of wagering. These other uses are something I also will be looking into. Hadn't encountered that.

You want to make room for the story to unravel, the tension to build up, player interaction to coalesce.
