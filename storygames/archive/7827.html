That thread: "[techniques] How do you roleplay rage and yelling?"<br/>I think it's very interesting and wanted to bring up new topics in my reply that I'd love feedback and thoughts on...<br/><br/><br/>My topic questions:\n<ul>\n<li><b>What do you think about relieving the "embarassment" of role-playing?</b></li>\n<li>Do you believe it serves a purpose to make the game environment "safe"?</li>\n<li>How do you do this?</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kobayashi</cite>If my NPC is yelling, I yell. I'm with the guy, if the PCs piss him off I yell.<br/>BUT<br/>My players know that I'm in character, if I'm running a Con I make sure the players know how I run NPCs.</blockquote>\n<br/>I agree with this.  <br/>Luckily my gang games in a place (my apt) that allows for this.<br/><br/>I admit though that I've (unintentionally) shocked or surprised newer players before by forgetting to let them in on HOW I role-play NPCs.  I also have a player (at least one) that HATES to have his personal space violated...  And I've unintentionally pushed that.<br/><br/>On the shock and surprise...  Most players (that I gravitate to, or they gravitate to me) tend to enjoy that style of role-play.  It's not quite LARP in nature but my style does push more toward that interaction.  For example - if the NPC is a 9' troll, I stand on a chair when playing him,  if the NPC is a Dwarf I stand on my knees,  if drunk I stumble and bump into things (or the player),  if crumbling to the ground from a wound I lay down on my floor to role-play their final words,  etc... etc...<br/><br/>YES - it hits the shock point when yelling or being overtly active, but as I noted... most that I game with learn to enjoy it.<br/><br/>My theory...<br/>If the GM  (or host of the game area)  is the FIRST to step up and be over-the-top in role-play like this the other players will feel comfortable that the game area is a "SAFE" environment where the GM won't allow the other players to poke fun at anyone for their active role-playing...  If I (as GM) stand up and "make a fool of myself"  then it signals EVERYONE to be able to role-play any emotion or style and know they won't be looked at in a weird uncomfortable way.<br/>Some players will naturally be apprehensive to that sort of active role-play.  But when you "tell them" its okay... that it's SAFE, then you allow them to enjoy the experience.<br/><br/><br/>So I do my best to FIND an NPC that is more bombastic in their style of emotion/action/talk to role-play right away in a new campaign.  Because by doing so I set a TONE for the group, the game, the campaign, and any new members to my group that allows the awesome intense emersive style play I (and so many others) enjoy.  But again - as a GM (or host) the players DESERVE to feel and believe that it's a SAFE environment.<br/><br/><br/>I've actively spoken up and "scolded" (in a helpful fair way) other players for teasing or making fun of other players role-play.  Generally I feel that that teasing (or chuckles, etc..) at another player for being more bombastic is done to relieve that given player of feeling embarassed at the game table.<br/>I mean... consider... 4-6 adults (primarily men) that are sitting around a table playing "make-believe"... sometimes pretending to be the opposite sex,  or role-playing emotions...  putting themselves in what generally could be comprimising and/or embarassing situations.  It's kind of ridiculous at face-value that me  (37 year old man)  hang out for 8-10 hours of our friday or saturday (prime date nights)  with 4-6 other men pretending to be dwarfs or orks or dainty little girls, etc...  <br/>At face value we "deserve" to be laughed at, made fun of........  <br/><br/>But we (RPG hobbiests) KNOW that this can be one of the most rewarding creative and critical thinking hobbies on the planet.  <br/><br/>With that...  we deserve to feel comfortable and safe among friends to enjoy and push that experience.<br/>THAT is why I (as GM and/or host) am always the first to "make a fool" of myself  AND  ensure that I quash anyone for teasing, chuckling or in any way making others at my table feel bad for enjoying our hobby...<br/><br/><br/><br/>thoughts?<br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao" title="sacredchao"><img alt="sacredchao" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao">sacredchao</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173412/#Comment_173412" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T00:37:35+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 12:37AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience, getting the group comfortable with the environment is the most important thing. If it's a house or apartment, meeting there to socialize once in a while should relieve a lot of that tension. People get used to fetching their own drinks, know where the restrooms are, if any parts of the place are off-limits, stuff like that. Once people are comfortable in their surroundings, the rest should come naturally.<br/><br/>One friend of mine really hates playing in public, even at a gaming store. He will play mini games at a store, but won't RP at all. I personally have played in stores and a cafe, and have had no problems with either, once I got used to the people I was with and the environment (though one of the workers at the cafe was a real douche).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173673/#Comment_173673" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T19:25:35+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  7:25PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kevperrine</cite>My theory...<br/>If the GM  (or host of the game area)  is the FIRST to step up and be over-the-top in role-play like this the other players will feel comfortable that the game area is a "SAFE" environment where the GM won't allow the other players to poke fun at anyone for their active role-playing...

Starting... now!"<br/>And that's a potentially dangerous thing to demand from a player, because they might balk and feel uncomfortable.<br/>And what you're saying makes a LOT of sense, and I feel like I should make a conscious effort in my next couple games to put myself on the chopping block first.<br/><br/>Immediately make an example of myself and allow others to follow suit.<br/><br/>I like this idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173754/#Comment_173754" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T06:23:13+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  6:23AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * What do you think about relieving the "embarassment" of role-playing?<br/>\n<br/>\nIts something I do sometimes, when the circumstances are right. Sometime that emarassment is their to keep people in line. I have a much quiter group than you, and to some extent some things are taboo (besides the most bombastic, theirs also sexy and the thigns that come with that, calling people cheaters, drama , Criticism, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\n    * Do you believe it serves a purpose to make the game environment "safe"?<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, social norms help everyone in what to expect which in turn makes a place seem less scary. The big thing I try to keep down is criticism and manners at the table, as in I expect manners and no criticism more or less at the table. This means that I am more empowered than the others ( those embarressing things that are breaking the zen i take it upon myself to moderate). We all manage to have fun, and I definitely see bonding and development of characters and  players. <br/>\n<br/>\n    * How do you do this?<br/>\n<br/>\nCentral Authority Negotiating Group Dynamics<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you enjoy<br/>\n<br/>\nLogos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
