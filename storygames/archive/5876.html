In Bispebjerg Hospital, former brain surgeon Dr. Thorkild Lauersen has gathered a small group of teenagers, in the fight against the nightmareish dream aliens. In their battle they desperately seek to understand the dreamworld and, hopefully, undo the bliss.<br/><br/><big><b>The Characters</b></big><br/><br/><b>Authority Figure</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Thorkild Lauersen, age 60</span><br/>* Leader of the group.<br/>* Stays ahead of the Bliss by surfing on the edge of sleep. He has equipment hooked up that sends shocks through him when he is about to enter REM sleep. He cures the tiredness with a drug cocktail of his own design<br/>* He is the father of Simon. He delivered Simon from his Blissed mother after a two year pregnancy (the Bliss kept her body and the unborn child in stasis) <br/><br/><b>Pilots</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aynur (Rising Hero), age 14</span><br/>* Azzizas twin sister<br/>* Has a tense relationship with Mikkel<br/>* Has been pregnant a number of times, but has always chosen abort. It is not clear who the father has been.<br/>* Usually sits on the hospital roof keeping an eye on things <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mikkel (Devoted Lover), age 16</span><br/>* Former gangmember<br/>* Raped Azziza while he was still in the gang<br/>* He is the Father of Muhammed<br/>* Is in love with Azziza and wants to be accepted as the father of their child<br/>* Everyone knows what he has done to Azziza. The only reason he was let into the resistance group was that he is willing to do all the dangerous/dirty work, and later because he had talent as pilot. <br/><br/><img alt="Mikkel" src="http://anders.blimmer.dk/Images/mikkel.png"/><br/><br/><b>Anchors</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Achmed (is Clever), age 11</span><br/>* Aynurs Anchor<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mie (is Kind), age 13</span><br/>* Mie is Mikkels Anchor and one of the few people who tolerates him <br/><br/><b>Others</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Azziza, age 14</span><br/>* Aynurs twin sister <br/>* Was raped by Mikkel<br/>* Mother of Muhammed<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chang, age 12</span><br/>* Has betrayed his former gang and is with the group for protection<br/>* Was "found" by Mikkel after he fled the gang, and because of that he now look up to Mikkel<br/>* Is an outsider and not yet trusted<br/>* Dr. Laursen seems to think that he would make a good pilot<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lars, age 7</span><br/>* Aynur and Azzizas adopted child <br/>* The sisters found him as a baby, alone and crying shortly after the Bliss hit<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Muhammed, age 1</span><br/>* The result of Mikkels rape of Azziza<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Simon Lauersen, age: 5</span><br/>* Simon is Thorkilds son<br/>* He was born while his mother was in the Bliss  <br/>* He is deaf and autistic<br/>* He has a strange connection with the Hunters (aliens) and can sense their coming. <br/><br/><br/><big><b>The setting</b></big><br/><br/>In the area around the hospital there is a number of gangs. Some of these are ethnic groupings. There is a Kurdish group where Aynur and Azziza originally comes from, and there is a Chinese group which is where Chang come from. The gang which Mikkel was part of does not exist anymore (it was eradicated by the other gangs because they where too violent).<br/><br/>We decided to call the Aliens Hunters (J\xe6gere) instead, because there is no good Danish translation of the word "Alien". How the Hunters looks can be seen below.<br/><br/>The dreamworld ended up being a twisted mirror image of the waking world, but underneath the ground there are caves where all sorts of weird stuff can dwell.<br/><br/>There was a moment during the setup phase, when we look at how old Azziza had been when Mikkel raped her, where we had to pause a bit to talk about lines and vials, and just how dark and brutal we wanted the setting. We decided that it was ok to aim for the more brutal version.<br/><br/><br/><big><b>Character Assignment</b></big><br/><br/><b>Thomas (GM)</b>, controls: Dr. Thorkild Lauersen, Azziza, Chang, Muhammed<br/><b>Frederik</b>, controls: Aynur, Mie, Simon Lauersen<br/><b>Anders (me)</b>, controls: Mikkel, Achmed, Lars                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Larsen" title="Anders Larsen"><img alt="Anders Larsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Larsen">Anders Larsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131527/#Comment_131527" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T04:45:36+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  4:45AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<big><b>Mission Action: Stop and Destroy the Attacking Hunter</b></big><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pilot</span>: Aynur<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anchor</span>: Achmed<br/><br/>The dreamworld is dark and a white haze is hanging in the air obscuring any sense of direction. In the distance tall black buildings can be seen as dark mirror images of the buildings in the waking world. Aynur construct her ANIMa from her relations with Dr. Lauersen and Azziza; a tall, shining, metallic robot.<br/><br/>Achmed guide her in between the buildings where the Hunter is. In the first encounter she manage to wound it, just before it slip away from her. She later catch it in an ally where she finally destroys it.<br/><br/>During the encounter Aynur get hurt when the Hunter sprays her with its acid spiderweb. This destroys her relationship with Dr. Lauersen (which result in a fallout action later)<br/><br/><big><b>Mission Action: Stop and Destroy the Attacking Hunter</b></big><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pilot</span>: Mikkel<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anchor</span>: Mie<br/><br/>Mikkel construct his ANIMa from his relations with Azziza and Muhammed. Small, stooping with long limps and a knife in each hand.<br/><br/>Just as he enters the dreamworld a hunter materializes out of the haze and attack him. Mikkel manage to wound it, but during the conflict the anchor loses some of the control of the dreamworld. As a result a hole opens up in the ground and both the ANIMa and the Hunter falls trough and into a cave. After some fighting in the cave the Hunter falls into a river where it is consumed by a large tentacle monster. Mikkel get angry because the monster has stolen his game, so he charge it into the river. After some fighting he manage to kill the tentacle monster.<br/><br/>Mikkel manage to get through the fight with only a few "scratches" in his relationships with Mie and Muhammed. <br/><br/><img alt="Mikkels ANIMa fighting a Hunter" src="http://anders.blimmer.dk/Images/anima-kamp.png"/><br/><br/><big><b>Fallout Action: Aynur and Dr. Lauersen</b></big><br/>Dr. Lauersen summons Aynur to his office. He tells her that she has to train Chang as pilot, so Chang can replace her in that duty. Aynur does not react very well when she hear this. Especially because Lauersen gives as reason that she is too careless when she faces dangers. Aynur argues that Mikkel is much worse than she (which is probably correct), but Lauersen will not listen. Aynur leaves the office angry and hurt.<br/><br/><big><b>Interlude Action: Mikkel and Azziza</b></big><br/>Mikkel want to try to come a bit closer to Azziza (she obviously hates him). He finds her and Muhammed in a yard. He finds a ball and tries to play a bit with Muhammed. Mikkel throws the ball, but when Muhammed run after it he falls and begins to cry. Mikkel try to go and help Muhammed, but Azziza is faster and take Muhammed to comfort him. She tell Mikkel to go away and leave them alone. Mikkel plead with her and ask if there is anything he can do for her. She answer him that he can go on a mission and get himself killed.<br/><br/>Mikkel turn to leave, but before he goes he tell her that, no matter what she says, he will always do everything he can to protect her and Muhammed.<br/><br/><i>This scene resulted in Trust Building</i><br/><br/><big><b>Interlude Action: Aynur and Achmed</b></big><br/>Aynur is standing in the sleep laboratory and look at her pilot-suit, when Achmed comes by (Achmed is a bit of a tech-geek, so he often goes around and tweak the electronic in the laboratory). With tears streaming down her cheeks she tells Achemd what Dr. Lauersen has asked of her. Achmed is shocked to hear this, and tries to comfort her, though a bit awkward. He tells her that he think that she is the best pilot, and he don't want to be anchor for anyone else. Aynur gives him a hug before she leaves.<br/><br/><i>This scene resulted in Trust Building</i><br/><br/><big><b>Interlude Action: Aynur og Mikkel</b></big><br/>Aynur and Mikkel bump into each other in the laundry room (Aynur and Mikkel does not like each other, especially is it Aynur who hates Mikkel, so nothing good ever comes out of those two meeting). Aynur, at once, begins to rage at Mikkel. She says that it is unfair that it is her that Chang shall replace as pilot, because she is the best pilot and it is Mikkel who is the irresponsible one. Mikkel tries to defend himself, but in the end he say that he do not think that Chang can become as good a pilot as Aynur is. The stress level decrease a bit after that. Even though they despise each other, they both respect the others talent as pilots.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This scene resulted in Trust Building</span><br/><br/><big><b>Interlude Action: Aynur and Chang</b></big><br/>Aynur meets Chnag in the kitchen, where Dr. Lauersen has given him the dish washing duty. He gets nervous and drops a plate, but Aynur does not help him pick up the pieces. She tells Chang that Lauersen want him to be pilot instead of her, and then warn him not to trust Dr. lauersen.<br/><br/><i>This scene resulted in Intimacy Building</i><br/><br/><big><b>Interlude Action: Mie and Chang</b></big><br/>Mie and Chang talks while they are working in the kitchen. Chang talk about his past; how he had to flee from his former group.<br/><br/><i>A relation was created between Chang and Mie</i><br/><br/><big><b>Interlude Action: Mie and Mikkel</b></big><br/>Mikkel go to find Mie ind the kitchen. He is a bit uncomfortable because of how much he shouted at Mie during the mission, so he want to apologize. Mie tells him that it doesn't matte, and it is probably her own fault because she is not a very good anchor. Mikkel get irritated because she is so self-deprecating, and a bit brutal he tell her that she is the best anchor he could wish for. In the end they hug each other.<br/><br/><i>This scene resulted in Stress Relief</i><br/><br/><br/><big><b>Discussion</b></big><br/><br/>We was not really sure exactly how to handle the dream world, and who should control what. We all felt that it should be possible to get much more out of the dreamworld than we manage to get in this session. But this is probably something which will correct itself with experience.<br/><br/>We talked about how to make the mission actions more story based, so Thomas will try to put more structure into them; interesting to see how that turns out.<br/><br/>We had a lot more interlude scenes than what the book suggest. But since we only are two players we need a lot of scenes each to get the side-characters into play.<br/><br/>We are all excited about the characters and the setup, and certainly look forward to how it all is going to develop.<br/><br/> - Anders                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20Ulricht" title="Thomas Ulricht"><img alt="Thomas Ulricht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20Ulricht">Thomas Ulricht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131552/#Comment_131552" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T07:01:10+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  7:01AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are some wicked drawings, Mikkels ANIMa with the knives ,damn that looks cool.

In particular, the GM should use briefing actions to place pressure on the pilots.  As the game goes on, the GM really shouldn't allow a pilot to get around to all the secondary characters.  After all, that's mission effectiveness right there!  Once the pilot gets his privileged interlude, the GM should consider dropping another mission on him.<br/><br/>Regarding mission prep.  When I GMed this game, I simply had a series of missions prepped.  In my head, there was an arc to them that I established independent of any other action going on in the game.  As I've noted elsewhere, in <i>Bliss Stage</i>, the GM plays the war, and the war waits for no one and nothing.  Especially not your broken heart.  So the mission arc shouldn't really be connected to events in the interludes.  Rather, connect it to the narrated events in the missions.  Did the aliens win big last mission?  Then maybe they press in harder next mission, so you have to Defend the Base.  Did the children strike a blow for freedom?  In that case, maybe the next mission is about assaulting the alien base.  Or whatever.  You talked about caves.  Maybe a mission to scout them out.  Then, of course, you let them symbolize the hidden subconscious desires of the pilot and see where it goes....<br/><br/>Anyways, I really enjoyed playing this game before, and I hope that it continues to go well for you.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Larsen" title="Anders Larsen"><img alt="Anders Larsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Larsen">Anders Larsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131685/#Comment_131685" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T12:08:30+00:00" title="February 29, 2008 12:08PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Great Wolf</cite><cite>Posted By: profet</cite><br/>I was thinking about the part about getting all the secondary characters into play, it occurs to me that we don't really need to get around all of them right away - They can just as easily be introduced and fleshed out later if they become important to the pilots.

I think that the changes then would have a grater impact. But I can see how the feeling urgency would disappear if there where too many interlude actions (unless you could have interlude action without any mechanical effect?). Anyway, this is probably only a problem I will have in the beginning of the game.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: profet</cite>One thing we didn't seem to agree on is how exactly intimacy corresponds to power in the dreamworld.

It is a common theme in manga and anime that the hero fights best if he fight for the one he loves; it gives him that extra willpower which he need to win the battle. But if the pilot actually knew that they can hurt the people they use for the ANIMa, it would greatly impact how the pilots would behave during the mission. For instance, I would not think that Mikkel would ever had used his relations to Azziza and Muhammed in a mission. <br/><br/>But I really don't have any problem if it is only something the authority figure knows. For me it just feel a bit strange that it is something real in the fiction.<br/><br/> - Anders                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20Ulricht" title="Thomas Ulricht"><img alt="Thomas Ulricht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20Ulricht">Thomas Ulricht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131710/#Comment_131710" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T12:42:52+00:00" title="February 29, 2008 12:42PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anders, I agree about it being very appropriate on an abstract level using the relatioships as inspiration for fighting, but wouldn't it also be cool if Mikkel knew that the piece of equipment taking damage was actually a real person(his own son for example)? It would put something at stake every time he got in that tank, not just his own life. Of course, Mikkel could be ignorant of the fact and then discover it at some point.
