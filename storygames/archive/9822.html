Someone needs to organize another con or something...<br/><br/>I was a little curious about the way Fortune accrued &amp; Allies developped:<br/><br/>The main question about Fortune is whether it is personal or crew-wide. All obvious mechanical signs point to personal -- it's on the character sheet, it's used to buy gear/improve allies and those are personal, etc. -- but I feel that the narrative set-up points to Fortune being a crew- or ship-wide resource. Certainly it seems that Fortune is earned by the crew as a unit, based on the jobs they complete, the hazards they face, etc. The inclusion of ship maintenance under 'things that cost Fortune' could be seen as reinforcing that as well.<br/><br/>But okay, it works out alright if you assume that Fortune is generally earned as a group, but is then divided and spent by individuals. However, the text doesn't seem to mention this explicitly, or how it might work, so I'm left a little uncertain. Given that Fortune is highly abstract, and could represent all manner of payments, it seems like this could lead to some confusion/aggravation.<br/><br/>The ability to increase Allies' ratings using Fortune -- explicitly, through bribery, or simply by doing things for the Allies that would otherwise give Fortune payouts -- also interacts with this question at a oblique angle. Since Allies appear to be individual, but Hazard results in a crew-wide Fortune increase, there is a tradeoff of group earnings for individual efficacity -- who makes the call?<br/><br/>Now the answer to all of this could just be 'story, dumbass' -- in Firefly, for example, we can imagine Mal making all these sorts of decisions as the Captain, and we can think of situations where the individual characters take action to bypass his decisions (keeping loot for themselves, shunting it to secret allies, etc.) Similarly, if Bob's allies want him and his buddies to blow up a moon somewhere, Bob has to convince the Captain that this is a better idea than salvaging valuable tech or shuttling wealthy ambassadors around.<br/><br/>So I guess it's not that I was confused to the point of unplayability, I was just surprised that none of this seemed to be addressed directly. Perhaps I am missing something about how Fortune is meant to work.<br/><br/>The other question about Allies was: does their scope increase in direct accordance with their die size? And if so, isn't that kind of weird? Shouldn't the highest-scope actions be harder, period, even if you have the allies to undertake them? Instead it seems like the allies get even better at solving all problems, <i>as well as</i> being able to solve more and more problems. Mechanically it's fine but the outcome in terms of story seems weird to me. Maybe high-scope allies should get worse at low-scope conflicts? (I will help you convince your friend to make good on his gambling debts... with the Galactic Fleet!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218384/#Comment_218384" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T03:05:20+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  3:05AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John: I did, in a smoky back-room full of sinister people like that Harper guy.<br/><br/>Darren: Think of it like the relationships between all the crew on Firefly.

In the text it says <i>restore</i>, not increase. Allies can become impaired just like anything else. Getting back into their good favor is a little easier than earning that favor at all in the first place.<br/><br/>Maybe that will still be off-kilter.
