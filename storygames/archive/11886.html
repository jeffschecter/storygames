So excited, in fact, that she ran the game for her class of 4th graders. This is the story they created by playing the game:<br/><br/> <img alt="image" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2764/4489977880_d1fdbaf620.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4489977960_796b560ef8.jpg"/> <br/><br/>Happy Birthday Robot!<br/>Robot glanced outside sadly because he couldn't go outside.<br/>Robot saw rain, but he was still in a good mood.<br/>Robot wanted to play in the rain, so he went to ask his mom.<br/>Robot's mom said okay, and Robot was extremely happy, but it suddenly stopped raining.<br/>Robot's friends came to his house and they went out to eat at Robot's favorite restaurant.<br/>His favorite restaurant was The Oil Shop and he loved motor oil baked casserole.<br/>Robot ordered his meal happily and for dessert he had a battery cake with chocolate oil.<br/>Robot's friends gave Robot an oil gift and they went to the park.<br/>Robot and Robot's friends played on the swings all day.<br/>Robot had a fantastic and wonderful birthday!<br/>The End <br/><br/>Here's what the kids said:\n<blockquote>"We used Robot a lot since it was a free word, it would be nice if could use pronouns as free words too."<br/>"I wish I had fewer coins, so I could have the last sentence."<br/>"Can we play it again?"<br/>"That was awesome!"<br/>"Duh! Robots love oil!"</blockquote>\nI'm definitely adding those ideas to the book as optional rules. Cassie sends along these comments, too:\n<blockquote>"Another one of my 4th grade teachers wants me to teach her how to play HBR, so she can run it. It's going to be all the rage at Derrick Thomas Academy!"</blockquote>\nYay! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265428/#Comment_265428" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T09:09:33+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  9:09AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks really cool - for the benefit of those of us outside the US, how old are fourth-graders?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265431/#Comment_265431" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T09:23:09+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  9:23AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Around 10 years old, on average.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265433/#Comment_265433" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T09:25:27+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  9:25AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You generally start Kindergarten at 5yo, so after K1234, you'd be 8-10?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265465/#Comment_265465" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T14:26:07+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  2:26PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Generally, yeah that's how the ages work out.
