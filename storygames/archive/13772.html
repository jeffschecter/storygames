I do want to have a serious discussion on here about the viability of moving storytelling out of the individual RPG model and into a kind of national/state model via diplomatic/adversarial storytelling. So here goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI released this game called Statecraft: a Grand Strategy Roleplaying Game as a public beta today. Free download is here: http://statecraftgsrpg.blogspot.com/2011/02/statecraft-public-beta-release.html<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a 40-page RPG designed to be played on the web via forums or e-mail. I am about to start Beta testing it. <br/>\n<br/>\nStatecraft is my attempt to take a lot of the forum-driven faux-roleplaying that I experienced when playing grand strategy computer games online in small groups for fixed multi-hour sessions over a time interval (i.e. every Tues and Thurs from 8pm to 12pm EST). Outside of this timeframe, I found I was engaging in a ton of instant-messaging and e-mail diplomacy to maximize political positions when the game started up again. Sessions would end in the middle of huge wars, we would come back and as soon as the game started things would restructure based on the diplomacy done in the interim. Very interesting, I thought I would try to replicate it as it's own game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginally, I had retained a lot of the wargaming aspects but over time and multiple revisions a lot of that was stripped away. Now the game is down to what I consider a fairly streamlined version for easy use on the web. Obviously, there is a lot more to do before I really have a good feel for how the game will end up playing out. I am currently recruiting testing groups to start finding out how it plays, so far I am just going on conjecture based on my RPG experience and my wargaming experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question for the Story Games community is: how do you think switching from a self-centered individual avatar to a multi-generational dynastic avatar that rules over the fate of millions of people will alter the non-mechanical aspects of the game (i.e. the story / the shared experience)?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a traditional RPG design where you have a single character, you are going to be viewing actions through that lens. In Statecraft, I specifically created structures to judge the player based on the size of the ripples they make in the pond. Dramatic failure on a national scale can play out in a way that benefits the player via a reward mechanic based on being bold. If we strip away the character's insistence on the protection of the self and we see time not in the small scale of a single life but played out over generations, how do you think player behavior will change from what they are used to?<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, the players are cast in opposition to one another by being in command of opposing nations and they gain power in the game based on their ability to pull off really amazing feats of diplomacy and skill. How will that change their storytelling and worldbuilding behaviors? Especially when we are heading into an anachronistic world that runs off the rails of history as soon as the player starts making choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I am kinda heading into a brave new world here, very interested in the thoughts of others on how it will play out.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311781/#Comment_311781" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T17:20:40+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  5:20PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Couple of things right off.<br/><br/>1) I love the concept.<br/><br/>2) it takes ages to download the 20MB and there is no indication on your site that anything is happening while waiting, so I figured for about 5 minutes that the link was broken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311784/#Comment_311784" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T17:30:48+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  5:30PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, it seems very crunchy - very , yes well, grand strategy-like.  duh.  but theres a reason why this type of game is ideal for computers or boardgames - the emotional/imaginitive/contextual interaction between the players is minimal.

The reason is the art, which is at a really nice resolution. If you are using IE, there should be a little progress meter in the bottom left corner of the browser as it downloads the PDF. And anyone can right-click save-as from the blog page to download it as an item. Sorry for any inconvenience you experienced.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding crunchy, I find your comment strange considering I feel like I really stripped a lot of that out of the game. The rules are maybe as complex as 2e D&amp;D. Everything is resolved by a test. There is a short checklist to go through each year. I was trying to keep the complexity level down to a point that would be appropriate for forum play, so I removed a lot of things that I felt would have made the game more interesting but that added too many decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said in my initial post, this was designed to capture the excessive amount of diplomacy that was occuring off-screen in my PC games. So no, social interaction between players is not minimal. Diplomacy is a board game, but it triggers a ton of social interaction (hence the name). My game is very much not about moving resources around, but about the interaction between players. That is why diplomacy is the longest chapter and combat is resolved with a few die rolls and generic units. I had to have rules to adjudicate combat, but they are designed to be as simple as possible so that people can focus on the real heart of the game; the interaction between people.<br/>\n<br/>\n@ Tony Dowler<br/>\nAwesome! Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n@ theg33k<br/>\nI only recently discovered Birthright and have only seen the module-type material, not the core rule elements. However, I am not surprised that it is hard to graft on diplomatic rules to a game largely about personal combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311843/#Comment_311843" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T07:14:57+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  7:14AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>2) it takes ages to download the 20MB and there is no indication on your site that anything is happening while waiting, so I figured for about 5 minutes that the link was broken.</blockquote>\nDon't load in browser: Right Click, do Save As, then walk away.

RPGs have done much weirder things before.<br/><br/>The main questions I have are:<br/><br/>-- How do you expect the narrative to really emerge in this game?  Is it does as in a history textbook ("Well, I'm going to send the Spanish Armada to attack England"), depersonalized from the monarch that you are presumably playing, or is it more personal ("I call the Fleet Admiral to my chambers." "What do you want, my liege?" "I have decided that we should attack those English fools"), playing out interactions between historical persona, with the GM playing NPCs?<br/><br/>-- If it's the former, it really sounds like you're playing the state in abstract (including all its resources) and not really the sovereign. That's fine and is typically what you do in Diplomacy and so on, but then I wonder if it's really best to think of it as a roleplaying game instead of a board-less strategy game.  If characters are never really going to interact, if you just have these situations that you handle by rolling dice and manipulating resources, it's just a strategy game without the board, yeah?<br/><br/>-- Right now, the 40 pages of dense description are hard to parse at first glance.  Is it possible that you could make a quick-play guide or some cheat sheets that summarize everything in a couple of pages, especially things like: "It's my turn; what am I supposed to do?"  That would make it way easier to get a sense of what you are trying to do with this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ryoken" title="ryoken"><img alt="ryoken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ryoken">ryoken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311906/#Comment_311906" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T13:34:30+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  1:34PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2011 1:35PM by ryoken.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ J Walton<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the thoughtful reply.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy answers:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Very much in the latter side of things. Description and interaction, less wargamish<br/>\n<br/>\n- Yes, it is a strategy game without a board in the same way that D&amp;D is a tactical game without a board. Gameplay is intended to develop around those core mechanics, not be totally determined by them. For example, I said you can write peace treaties subject to any terms you wish. Obviously that implies you will be negotiating and bargaining over a huge range of things, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n- I don't know 40 pages of 12 pt font can be dense, compared to other games. I'm not trying to be defensive, I am genuinely perplexed when people make commentary like this. What is the standard we are comparing against? I try to make my layout as open and easy to follow as possible. If it isnt, I would love commentary on that. That said, I think you may be on to something here about a quick-play issue, perhaps a well-developed example of play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311915/#Comment_311915" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T14:13:16+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  2:13PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            hey.  My point is, it seems like the diplomatic side of state management is your aim, which makes sense because sitting around a table talking is the strength of race to face RPGs.  So I would abstract other aspects away almost to nothing - just enough so that each player still has a position worth talking about.  and by doing that, you can bring in some other (highly abstracted) concepts that you havent been able to add right now due to trying to keep the crunch down.  Like trade.  Like really beefing up the religion/papacy aspect which could be real fun as a position for the GM to play.<br/><br/>There is a pretty well thought of board game called Empires of the Middle Ages that might be worth a look in that it is an example of how you can really abstract the hell out of things and still have them as an important factor in the game, in order that undue complexity in secondary aspects of your design doesnt detract from/obscure the primary aspect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311916/#Comment_311916" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T14:17:08+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  2:17PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With regard to the papacy, there is an online game you might have heard of called Lords of the Earth (LOTE).

They own at most one small area of land, but their 'empire' consists of religious infrastructure in other peoples states, so there is this real parasitic/co-dependent  relationship between the nominal states and the primacies because the primacies need the states to generate cash and the states need the primacies to help keep the people under control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311925/#Comment_311925" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T14:44:20+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  2:44PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Greg, I guess that 40 pages of 12-point is pretty terse for a lot of "mainstream" RPG writing, most "indie" games these days are much more concise and to the point, especially when it comes to rules procedures.  That's what I'm used to now, which is why you text seemed a bit intimidating.  It's not a problem, unless you're hoping for a particular audience for you game that isn't used to these kinds of game texts.  I was hoping for something much more like the procedures for a board game, not necessarily instead of your text, but at least in addition to it:<br/><br/>On your turn:<br/>-- Do this thing...<br/>a. substep 1<br/>b. substep 2<br/>c. substep 3<br/>-- The do this thing...<br/>a. substep 1<br/>b. substep b<br/>etc.<br/><br/>With less explanation about why you might want to do something or how you should think about it or what it represents.  Just the straight up procedures for play.  This would be useful both to help understand the rules more easily and as something to consult during play rather than having to look things up constantly.<br/><br/>On the other issues, I have a couple more questions:<br/><br/>-- Do the GM-played NPCs then have either 1) mechanical significance (it matters whether you have a good admiral or not) or 2) their own interests, apart from the sovereign, which the GM can have them pursue?  Because if they have neither then, in play, I would find it difficult to care about them because they will simply be doing what I instruct them to do.  They are my fingers and toes then, so talking to them is like talking to myself, even if the GM plays them.  Do you see what I mean?<br/><br/>-- The danger I see in giving them complete independence is now the GM has to run the domestic politics of multiple different countries, which is a lot to manage.  The stats of the sovereigns and their states certain are some assistance in this regard, but it might be interesting to consider tying certain PC character traits to specific NPCs or groups of NPCs, such that the GM can assert some fictional change in their status or relationship with the sovereign when there are mechanical changes in abilities and resources.  For example, if my state gets most of its income from mineral weath, perhaps that's tied to the state's mining conglomerate, which is a monopoly with a managerial staff apppointed by the king. If there is a sudden domestic change in wealth, then the GM can bring in the NPCs from the mining conglomerate and we can try to deal with it.  Better yet, maybe the GM can create some event in which the mining conglomerate, seeking their own interests, tries to take over control of the state's mineral wealth from the sovereign.  Adding some domestic political issues, on top of international interactions with other states, would make the whole thing really meaty.<br/><br/>-- Lacking that, the main danger I see is making rolls or taking mechanically significant actions (going to war, etc.) but then not really translating them back into the fiction so we have a sense of what's actually happening in the world, what changes are occuring, etc.  Else it's just numbers changing and we can only care about that in a mechanical sense ("I'm losing the game!") rather than a fictional sense ("I'll show those mercenary bastards in the mining conglomerate!").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311935/#Comment_311935" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T15:37:46+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  3:37PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, one last thought.

Regardless, there is no victory condition except to accumulate Prestige points which come from being bold and impressive, not fixed goals. The GM completely controls Prestige rewards, like XP in other games. So a fixed victory condition is not present in my game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
