[cut]"</i><br/><br/>You may use this technique to create suspense, but also to save words and let the players' imaginations fill in the rest. You've already declared the intention, so why should you describe what will happen? Everybody already knows what's going to happen. You can also use this when you're a GM and the group is split up. If the player fails a fatal roll, describe the negative effect but don't describe all the effects. Leave that to the player's imagination. In horror adventures, this will certainly make that person sweat.<br/><br/><i>Example: "You loose control over the car on the bridge and it crashes through the reeling.

Keith Johnstone talked in just one paragraph about <i>routines</i> and how you can keep up interest by breaking them before they finish. Breaking them by starting a new routine.<br/><br/>Think about that.<br/><br/>I did.<br/><br/>Translate this into roleplaying games. Lets say that you got a routine for framing the scene by describing the environment. Before you feel the environment is fully filled, start a new routine. Perhaps the routine in how to start a conflict or a revelation about a character? Before that new routine is done, start a new one. Perhaps the introduction of a new character in the scene? Before the scene is over - cut it - and start a new one with describing a new environment.<br/><br/>So this "rule of the unspoken" is purely a part of something bigger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
