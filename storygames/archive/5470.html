My solution is just to change the names of the classes, changing their "feel" without changing any mechanics. For the curious, here it is. I like how the existing Talents suit these new class names. The players won't even know they're really playing Foxes and Bears.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Class names:<br/><br/>*Old Name* --&gt; *New Name*<br/>Warrior --&gt; Soldier or Gladiator<br/>Bear --&gt; Barbarian Warrior<br/>Snake --&gt; Naga<br/>Fox --&gt; Faerie Exile<br/><br/>The change of the Warrior name is purely cosmetic, so it doesn't get confused with "Barbarian Warrior". All the other "human" classes don't need to be changed. I've also considered changing "Mystic" to "Druid", but decided to stick with the original. The Snake/Nage is cool and D&amp;D-traditional, so it gets to stay, just with a more "serious" sounding name. The Fox and Bear, on the other hand, get renamed:<br/><br/>The Barbarian Warrior is a giant, a proud, fiercely loyal warrior from a distant land where his or her people live in communion with Nature. A Barbarian Warrior is usually covered in tattoos (if from a Southern land) or adorned with bone decorations and furs (if from a Northern kingdom). If the Warrior's stature is not enough to identify them, most Barbarian Warrios also have a thick foreign accent and a very different colour of skin from the locals.<br/><br/>As for Faerie Exiles... <br/><br/>There was once an ancient race of faeries that now live deep inside inaccessible forests. No one has seen one for centuries, as they no longer deal with the outside world. All anyone remembers is that they were graceful, beautiful beings that flew around on wings that looked like they were made of stained glass. Some stories say they were wise magical beings who created great art; others tell how they used to steal into people's homes at night and kidnap infants from cradles.<br/><br/>However, one wanderer returned from a coastal port where he claims he met a very strange person--a petite, androgynous creature dealing stolen goods in the seedy underbelly of the town. He couldn't tell whether it was male or female, but it looked very much like a human until he spent some time observing it and noticed a few disturbing features. For starters, it slept during the day. Secondly, when it opened its mouth, it revealed an array of small, sharp, jagged teeth. Third, its eyes changed colours according to its mood and glowed faintly in the dark. Shadows and darkness didn't seem to bother the creature at all, in fact--if anything, it seemed completely at ease under such conditions. Finally, he claims that he once saw it remove its jacket, and that on its back, where a human would have shoulderplates, he glimpsed what looked like colourful glass shards, broken and cracked. As he tells the story, the creature explained to him that those were all that was left of its wings. It was exiled from its secret kingdom for some wrongdoing, and when it was exiled, those beautiful, radiant limbs were maimed and removed. <br/><br/>A Faerie Exile with the "Three Tails" Talent either escaped with its wings intact or has somehow managed to grow them back. "Shape Shifter" allows a Faerie Exile to switch to "human form" (+1 Size/-1 Alertness) or full "faerie form" (-1 Size/+1 Alertness), just as a Fox normally would.<br/><br/>Faeries are strictly carnivorous.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122564/#Comment_122564" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T20:56:25+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  8:56PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2008 8:56PM by John_Harper.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Faeries are strictly carnivorous.</blockquote>\nOh my yes.<br/><br/>This is cool, Paul.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122566/#Comment_122566" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T21:07:49+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  9:07PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks! <br/><br/>I had such "faeries" in a fantasy game I played a long, long time ago, and forgot about them.

So, I'm just sharing a happy realization!<br/><br/>Additional Note: If you play a Faerie character, write down on the back of your sheet which eye colours correspond to which mood or emotion (ex: Anger - Yellow, Fury - White, Boredom - Purple, Love/Affection - Green). During play, now and then mention what colour your character's eyes are. Let the other players figure it out as you play and they get to know your character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21" title="Sean ov Newcastle !"><img alt="Sean ov Newcastle !" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21">Sean ov Newcastle !</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122583/#Comment_122583" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T22:31:46+00:00" title="January 28, 2008 10:31PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mint! <br/><br/>You're right, it all fits - I may give my players this option - having them as exiles also means I can probably prise some backstory out of the player that could have a bearing on scenario design.
