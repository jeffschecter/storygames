                    So I gots me some gift certificates to the FLGS (worth a subhstantial amount, actually). And I went to the FLGS to spend them yesterday. I stayed for an hour. Then left empty-handed. Couldn't find anything that made me even want to buy it with free money.<br/>
<br/>
What did I miss? What should I get? It's James' shop, BTW: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.game-universe.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.game-universe.com</a><br/>

Help me with my strange connundrum!<br/>

                            Thought about it, but I'm just not a dice fetishist. When I need lotsa dice, I wait till GenCon, and buy a mug from one of the stands there.<br/>
<br/>
I also think a lot about getting game accessories like battlemats and such, which I think are really cool, but which I can't for the life of me actually imagine using. In fact I think I have one, unused, somewhere around my house. I don't use screens or the like either, and most games I play need few references....<br/>

                            Graham, if I knew what I wanted, would I be asking? Basically I'm saying that I don't feel like I need anything. That's the problem. Mostly I have reasons for why I don't want to buy X or Y.<br/>

I own Paranioa XP already, for instance. Could buy some supplemental material for it, I suppose, but I'm not planning on playing it any time soon.<br/>

                            I see that they have Truth &amp; Justice, but not Dead Inside, and wonder if they could order the latter one. DI is something of a subtly different beast from a lot of other RPG's; while it has light, somewhat traditional mechanics (I like them), the real meat is how the overall theme is set up and how it guides you with minimal system interference and strong thematics. In short: you have lost your soul and now you have to do good things in order to get it back. Love it, even with some shortcomings.<br><br>Truth &amp; Justice is not a bad choice either if you're into superhero genre; the mechanics share the good things from DI and are kind of customizable (for the super-powers). It lacks the strong theme of DI, but provides a good toolbox for setting up a superhero game. There's a short example setting of a character-driven campaign with very good advise.                        </br></br></div>

                            Dude, Dead Inside is the motherfucking bomb. If there's a chance that the LGS can get it, that's a really slick game. <br><br>Also, I feel like Mike sometimes, that I can go to the game store, but unless I look for stuff like Dice and all, there's not a lot that appeals to me. Even in the Indie RPG realm, I used to buy Just About Fucking Everything, now I'm a lot more cautious with my purchases and recommendations.  But it's not saddening or anything, and isn't a damning remark against modern games or anything: In high school I used to buy and read all sorts of games, yet play very few (I sat in the LGS and thumbed through all sorts of TORG, Shadowrun, Journe, AD&amp;D2E etc supplements and the like).  Nowadays, I game too goddamned much (there were a few weeks in the last two months where I had four nightly games each week! WTF??? Now I'm down to 1-2 again), so I tend to stick to games that I can really stand behind, run well and look forward to playing.<br><br>These days I'm more reserved about what to buy. If someone gave me $100 for the LGS, I'd first try to see if I could convert it over to Amazon or Buy.com (to buy books or useful stuff), but if not I tend to raid through chessex.com, koplowgames.com, boardgamegeek.com (looking for new games for my regular gaming group to play during downtime), etc looking for stuff that I can bring to the LGS to special order for me.<br><br>Or, alternately, I'd put it in my "September Folder", and wait until next September to find that coupon: By then there's probably going to be 2-3 surprising RPG products (Warhammer 40K RPG? Stranger Things? Latest from Luke Crane? Some Left-Field Awesomeness at Key20?) released by then that I'll want.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Like Andy says, I don't buy games just to collect them. I have to actually plan on playing them. And right now I'm not planning on playing anything other than Hero Quest, and a couple of other games that I already have (like the M-er F-ing game of Wyrd Is Bond that I've been trying to put together for more than a year now). Yeah and it doesn't help that I should be playtesting designs that I'm working on, or which people ask me to playtest, etc. My queue of "RPGs That Need to To Be Played" is long, but I have access to them all.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't see Truth &amp; Justice, or I might have been tempted to try that. I haven't tried anything new in supers since Hero System.<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure that they could order stuff...but this is the FLGS. I was hoping for instant gratification. In point of fact, I asked them to order Under the Red Moon (ILH2) for Hero Quest, but they don't seem to have taken it to heart. Or maybe I didn't ask right. I dunno. But I'd rather that there was something on the shelf that I could buy. Otherwise Dead Inside sounds like something I might try.<br/>
<br/>
There were a couple of indie games on the shelves, but I own them all already. Burning Wheel for example. If I had seen Burning Empires I would have picked that up immediately (it feels very odd not to own a copy of a book in which I have a credit). Actually they had lots of copies of Eldritch Asskicking, but I'm just not into the concept much. Though the more I think about it, the more it sounds like something I could run a one-shot of sometime. Put that on the maybe list.<br/>
<br/>
Miniatures - If they had Warhammer, I'd have spent all my money on that in a heartbeat, given that I play 40K regularly these days. But they're no longer a WH dealer (if they ever were), and only seem to have a few leftover items from that line. And that's what I'm seeing online, I didn't see anything at all when I was at the store.<br/>
<br/>
I'll check out Wings of War. Thanks Jason. I've also been interested in looking at their fantasy cognate to Twilight Imperium (which I play pretty regularly - in a game of it online right now).<br/>
<br/>
I don't get the Icehouse stuff. I've been told by my boardgame geek pals who I trust regarding boardgames and such that their games are largely broken.<br/>
<br/>
I've enjoyed the cheapass games that I've played, but not enough to buy them to plan to play them. I don't keep games around to play "just in case" because that never happens. Where I come from when there's time to play, we play something like Europa Universalis (the original boardgame version) that takes hundreds of hours to play. Or Advanced Squad Leader, or Star Fleet Battles (both contenders for most complicated games ever). No time to play the small stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Actually that's not entirely accurate, but I get my fix of small stuff games from my boardgame pals again on a regular basis, too. Like the "short" games of 18XX I get to play on a monthly basis.<br/>
<br/>
In fact that's why I don't buy boardgames for the most part. My Chicago friends own hundreds of them. Would simply be redundant.<br/>
<br/>
Bill: Have you tried San Juan, Mike?<br/>
Mike: You mean Puerto Rico, right?<br/>
Bill: No, San Juan. It's a far, far better game.<br/>
Mike: Huh, had no idea.<br/>
<br/>
I'm always afraid that anything I buy will be so yesterdays news that I'll never be able to play it. And since they have everything, why bother?<br/>
<br/>
Like the Wings of War recommendation. No matter how cool it looks, I probably won't buy it until I get clearance from those guys that it's a good buy. Because they collectively know more about boardgames than pretty much anyone.<br/>
<br/>
As Andy says, the problem is too much gaming. It's always hard to see where I could fit more in than I'm currently doing. And it doesn't look like the current stuff is going to run out of fun for...well till long after I'm dead. OK, that's an exaggeration, but there's no light at the end of the tunnel.<br/>
<br/>
This is why accessories sound like such a cool idea. Add to the fun I'm already having. But I have the dice I need. Again, what I wish is that I could come up with an excuse to need things like battlemats and miniature buildings or something. But I just don't use that sort of thing in RPG play anymore. Not because I don't want to, but because they seem superfluous in the games I'm playing.<br/>
<br/>
In a related vein, they had gamer T-shirts on sale for cheap ($10 a throw). You know, black, with things like Lunch Money cards on them. I have a drawer of shirts like that - including my recently mentioned Rush T-shirts - that I never wear. Heck, nowadays I look for excuses to wear my Cigar Aficianado T-shirt. I just don't get into the geeky stuff like I did when I was younger. There's always been a very straightlaced side to me. I used to say I was a "button-down" metal fan. That still pertains.<br/>
<br/>
Plush Cthulhu? Well, for my son Alex, maybe...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the thoughtful replies all.<br/>

<p>Hey, Mike,</p>
<p>What about something like, say, Campaign Cartographer? That's a somewhat spendy thing--most gaming software seems to be. I'd never buy it with my own money, but with a gift certificate, I'd pick it up in a hot second. I know you dig on detailed settings, and having used a couple of free ones, I can say that cranking out planets in a couple of minutes is great fun, suitable for all sorts of games. CC has the most features of any of these things I know of.</p>

                            Ah, the evils of gift certificates.

                            Well, I'd like to get something for myself if I can find something. If I can't within a reasonable time, maybe I will donate something...<br/>
<br/>
Seen the Gamers. I don't collect movies (there are too many I haven't seen to worry about having copies of ones that I have seen). And, again, this is the sort of random self-referential geeky gamer stuff that I don't go in for any more like those T-shirts. So, no, I'm not getting any Order of the Stick or KODT, or Dork Tower, or any of the bumper stickers that they have that say stuff like "I'll stop gaming when they pry the dice from my cold, dead hand."<br/>
<br/>
Actually I'm tempted to buy the Midnight Syndicate CD, now that I think about it. Not for it's musical content or anything, but just as mood music. Problem is that I don't do horror all that often. Now if there was some soundtrack they had available for fantasy play, perhaps to share tracks with people playing online with... Something non-cheesy. That might work. Hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
I actually pondered Campaign Cartographer seeing it online (missed it at the store). Has it gotten significantly better than before? It always struck me as producing kinda cheesy maps. Like I saw this ad for one of the expansion packs that says, "Ever find that you're having trouble because all of your map markers are human related?" And I'm thinking, "Nope." [In fact, my thought was that this has to be the work of somebody who had the problem themselves, being the only one, and then decided to sell their fix - making the advertisement ridiculous. Like, "Do you find your leaf-blower troublesome because it doesn't have a special squirrel-nest removal attachment?"]<br/>
<br/>
In any case, the "detail" in my worlds tends to be more about cultural notations and such than too much worry about where things are in precise relation to each other. Again, I wish I did have a use for maps like this. Maybe I need to start a D&amp;D campaign...<br/>
<br/>
In any case, as I said, if I was after maps, they have plenty of those I could buy off the shelf. I've purchased Traveller deck plans before, knowing that they're pretty much pointless (even when actually playing Traveller).<br/>

Well, people using CC2 with Mappa HÃ¢rnica toolkit have come up with results like this:<br><br><a href="http://www.aedificium.org/Maps/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aedificium.org/Maps/index.html</a><br><br>Wouldn't call them cheesy; more like reaching almost the exact level of HÃ¢rn maps which are one of the best around.

                            Who says I'm not a CCG player (is there a sort of game I don't play?) But I have enough cards to last a lifetime. Hell, my six year old son has enough cards to last a lifetime. Can't lift a finger in the house without running across a mess of Yu-gi-oh.<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to sell my Magic right now (I could sell thousands of cards and still have enough to play with). Haven't actually seen a good CCG design for a while. For reference, my favorite CCG ever was INWO. If it ain't that complex, I probably won't like it. The game should play slow and studied. I'm not into fast for fast's sake.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ben...I should have been more explicit. This is James' shop. RPGNow/Mall James (remember, I live in the center of the RPG universe). He might order from IPR, I don't know. But I'd feel a little funny even asking. In any case, as I said, I'm hoping I don't have to order. But I may eventually do that if I can't find something that's already there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jukka...holy cow, those are good. I think it's just that the examples they choose to advertise are cheesy or something looking like badly drawn Tolkien map emulations. So I'm much more tempted now. I just have to come up with an excuse for how I'm going to use the darn thing in play....<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking I should write up a game that really makes use of maps somehow.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Jukka...holy cow, those are good. I think it's just that the examples they choose to advertise are cheesy or something looking like badly drawn Tolkien map emulations. So I'm much more tempted now. I just have to come up with an excuse for how I'm going to use the darn thing in play....</blockquote>
Arguably the examples in <a href="http://www.profantasy.com/cc3/gallery.html" rel="nofollow">CC3 gallery</a> are a bit... Cheesier. I'm not sure if the standard CC comes with tool packages that help to create more realistic maps, but Mappa Harnica is free, in any case (and should work with CC3; I have a faint recollection of a thread conserning it HarnForum). I'd suggest getting a <a href="http://www.profantasy.com/library/demo.asp" rel="nofollow">CC2 demoversion</a> first, and try it out with the mentioned <a href="http://www.thechmp.com/MappaHarnica/Files.htm" rel="nofollow">Mappa Harnica</a> -toolkit. 
<blockquote>I've been thinking I should write up a game that really makes use of maps somehow.</blockquote>
I used to be content with HÃ¢rn and it's maps (pretty much the same level the examples had, only so much more) and calculating movements, weather and whatnot. Nowadays, I just appreciate the maps and browse the Harn(in)Dex, just for the heck of it.                        </div>

                            Mike, if I were you I'd be inclined to spend it on fiction and graphic novels and such. They're much better ways to recharge your creative batteries. As far as I can tell, though, this doesn't seem to be that sort of game store.<br><br>Ordering every HQ/HW title under the sun seems like it might be a good idea for you. Maybe you could pick up some supplements from that new RuneQuest, if only so you can sound informed when you explain why HQ is so much better. Also, do you have the latest ShadowWorld stuff?<br><br>I don't know if they stock things like traditional board games, but owning a fine chess or go set is always nice.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Mike: the reason to have Icehouse stuff around is not chiefly for the games already designed for them (although I suspect your board gamer friends may have simply drunk the Looney-Labs-makes-the-demon-Fluxx-so-boo-on-Icehouse koolaid), but because you are a game designer. Pieces made to be generic "playing cards of board gaming" are great thought-stimulators to have around. Yes, for RPG design.<br><br>I recommend the "open source" Piecepack for the same reason; although I find it less stimulating for its lack of physical niceness, YMM of course V. And any small board game that has very weird custom bits can serve the same purpose. I am so waiting for someone to design a story game using Elchfest as the primary mechanic.                        </br></br></div>

                            I think I know what Mike is talking about. Like those cards I was chucking around at random at GenCon that said stuff like "Plot Complication" on them with no text.<br/>
<br/>
That might be cool. I'll have to see if they've got any of that.<br/>
<br/>
Larry, got everything under the sun for Shadow World. Got most HQ/HW stuff. Ordered the one thing I don't have.<br/>
<br/>
I'll buy a nice chess set when my kids are old enough not to destroy it by accident. Right now the plastic set is perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Jukka, seems that I simply haven't looked closely at CC for a while. Still, I have to have seen it in passing at the GenCon booth... hmmm. Anyhow, even the cheesier stuff looks not so bad these days. We may have a winner.<br/>
