We were checking out the RPG section there, and a girl asked if we were going to start up a game (I thought boardgames, she meant RPGs, we sorted that out in 5 seconds). We talked a bit, and settled on Zorcerer of Zo, something I'd wanted to buy for ages but I've stopped buying anything I don't know I can get a game for.<br/><br/>I had never read it all the way through, but I did read the introduction, particularly all the info on types of fairy tales. I was also familiar with the PDQ system. Since it was literally a pick up game I streamlined the character generation even more, making it a combination of FATE and HeroQuest. <br/><br/>The 3 characters that got made up were a girl who got into Zo by pushing through a ravine from the real world, and found a princess killed in a landslide. She took on the princess' identity and was to go to magic school in the Jade City, but was a bit concerned that she might get found out and executed. Second character was a magical teddybear who dressed as a tiger because she wanted to be a tiger because they were brave and had stripes. The third character was a violander alchemist &amp; engineer who wanted to make a contraption to fly beyond the stars.<br/><br/>I literally just made stuff up as I went along, drawing on tropes, and since it was a fractured fairy tale, I got to turn some of them on their heads. It was somewhat absurd, and I could have done some things better, but at the end everyone achieved their goals (3 hours later), generally with a little modification.<br/><br/>I'm now going to sit down and actually read through the whole book entirely, which I'm looking forward to even more after finding out how well it played.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281433/#Comment_281433" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T09:20:37+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  9:20AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool.

PDQ lets you do the Risus/FATE trick of giving anything a stat rating and "Go!" with little to no need for massive game prep beyond a basic idea of where you want to go.<br/><br/>I love that kind of "orienteering" kind of game.  I like to read the map while I am walking the trail, so to speak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282622/#Comment_282622" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T10:25:01+00:00" title="July 23, 2010 10:25AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good way of putting it. A lot of RPGs require you to read and digest it first, and then play, while ZoZ is deffinitely a game where you can start playing right away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
