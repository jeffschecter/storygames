Creating a thief, I rolled 5 for Charisma.<br/><br/>Obviously, my first thought was that my character was rude. But I thought that would become boring. I wondered, briefly, about body odour and aggressiveness, before settling on <i>tedium</i>. My 5 Charisma meant that I was boring, I decided. I was a geeky thief, a lock obsessive.<br/><br/>And, God, that was the best roleplaying tool in the world. I spent the game talking about the intricacies of locks. "Oh, yeah, that's a mock Dwarven design". "That's going to be difficult, it's got horizontal tumblers". Every time I picked a lock or found a secret passage, I explained how. "The sliding mechanism meant it was flush against the rock, but you could see the cracks around the outline of the door. They should have disguised that with some fake moss."<br/><br/>I can't think of much, in indie games, that beats Charisma as a roleplaying tool. Firstly, it's random. I love that. You suddenly find yourself with 5 Charisma, or 15, and must explain it. Secondly, it's unspecific. It's not like a freeform trait: "I am obsessed with locks". That's much more dull. Charisma gives me some constraint, but also some freedom of imagination.<br/><br/>If there's one other roleplaying tool I like as much as Charisma, it's Intelligence. Playing a character with low Intelligence is equally fun.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191702/#Comment_191702" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T13:47:40+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  1:47PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have always liked the "high intelligence, low wisdom" combination.

(He also didn't speak English, which was a huge downside seeing as how I don't speak any languages <i>other</i> than English.)<br/><br/>Poxyse had a memorable debut, but his personal traits kinda faded out over time.  The game wound up being more about strategy and plot than showing off characters, and no one was that interested in yet another description of how bad cheap cigar smoke smells.<br/><br/>As for Charisma, most of my experiences playing alongside low-CHA characters would have been vastly improved by substituting an "obsessed with (trade)" or some other specific trait.

I rolled up a character with 16 Dex and 4 Con. Clearly the 16 Dex put me in thief territory (or I suppose Illusionist, as the Int was higher than 9). I thought about what the 4 Con might be. I decided that the Thief had some prior experience and ran into a trap that he failed to remove properly, and it poisoned him, severely weakening him. The end result was that he'd be willing to do normal Thief things, but when it came to traps he'd search for them, but if it was necessary to disarm them he'd go "'To hell with this, if this is the only way on, I'm going home." With the potential that if there was a very clear goal (rather than let's see what's further on), that was actually important (ie, save the world, or a good chunk of it type stuff), the other characters could cajole and bribe him into dealing with that one trap.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, it is like games that have quirk and backstory characteristics, but there's no way I'd think of "sprung a trap and was poisoned, badly weakening health" and "refuses to disarm traps" as Thief character concepts in a system like that. That's only something that comes up with the specific combination of High and Low scores. <br/><br/>I also rolled another one in BD&amp;D which was 9 across the board and 18 Wisdom. I was trying to think of how to deal with that, and then decided that I was a very old Priest, not really a fighter type, but the kind who has been around, talked to a lot of people and has experience. He hasn't actually been out adventuring himself, but he has heard a lot of stories from many adventurers, so he's not the type to make mistakes. Any description quirk that tips me off as a player that something is up, due to some meta-gaming (and I have to, 'cause there's no way I as a player have what would be considered 18 Wisdom), the character has heard about it and recognises something is different. So he doesn't make stupid decisions. For everything else though, he's not particularly competent. He's not strong, fast, tough, smart or well spoken, so his character role wasn't as much that of a leader as much as an advisor for the rest of the party.<br/><br/>Other times the rolls end up really boring and I can't think of a good back story. In that case, I like to completely re-roll everything and see if something better turns up. There's not much you can do with average across the board unless you have one high and one low score (only one high score can also work, average plus low score has some serious suck to it that makes me want to re-roll as well).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191954/#Comment_191954" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T15:09:25+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  3:09PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Can't any low stat be a role-playing opportunity?<br/></blockquote>\nYes!  Any stat score <i>at all</i>, in fact.  I made this point in my "Story Made Simple" thread project (that I should really get back to, but don't have the energy for).<br/><br/>The trick is to think of the character as a person first, and a functional avatar in the SIS second.  He's got 18 Strength?  Why?  Is it genetic?  If so, what was his family like?  Is he following in the footsteps of his forefathers, or breaking from them?  Or is it through training?  Or did he work a heavy-labor job?  Miner?  Dockworker?

My low-Wis, high-Int thief was smart enough to recognize a bad idea, but not wise enough to realize that he probably wouldn't be able to make it work anyway.  He'd say "Oh, I bet there will be consequences for doing this, but if I do it now I can deal with the consequences later, so I don't really need to worry about anything.  So let's get going, already!"<br/><br/>I think there's also room for low Wisdom to be flavored as an attention deficit, or as a propensity to daydream, or even as ultra-radical idealism.  Imagine a low-Wis character who is so devoted to some particular thing (veganism, pacifism, whatever) that he spends all of his time thinking about THAT instead of assessing the current situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191998/#Comment_191998" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T17:52:00+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  5:52PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Is a low Wisdom stupidity or naivete?</blockquote>\nThe simplest way of portraying it I have found is by lack of awareness and common sense.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Interesting take, Damian.

I'm sure you can remember some fictional characters like that, and I even know one or two such people irl, they can take practically any part of any sentence you're saying, and reply with some nonsense like "oh, that's totally in sync with you wearing t-shirts all the time \u2014 probably because you had strict parents and grew up too non-conformistic; you also like loud music, now don't you?".<br/><br/>BTW, as Graham mentioned somewhere above, Charisma and Constitution tell you more than Body and Mental, but less than Afraid-of-spiders-ness and Too-shy-to-talk-to-people-in-public-hood, and that's what makes them perfect to use, to think about and to talk.

Their hernia would affect absolutely everything!<br/><br/>They faint because the corsets they're wearing prevent them from being able to get a full lung of air. Which brings in the potential of statting corsets at -2 Con, -4 Con and -6 Con based on how much they shrink the waist.<br/><br/>Nope. Corsets weren't in fashion then. Indeed, the fashion was "Empire-waisted" dresses, which look more like maternity dresses than anything else these days....<br/><br/>Do you have anything that establishes women actually did faint regularly in that time period?

I don't remember a lot of fainting in Jane Austen's stories, though -- off-hand, I can only think of one instance, when a mother hears that one of her youngest daughters has run off with a guy.  They do a lot of walking, though, so they don't really fit the original poster's description of "who faint because they've walked a bit".

It's this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite>The trick is to think of the character as a person first, and a functional avatar in the SIS second.  He's got 18 Strength?  Why?  Is it genetic?  If so, what was his family like?  Is he following in the footsteps of his forefathers, or breaking from them?  Or is it through training?  Or did he work a heavy-labor job?  Miner?  Dockworker?  And so on.<br/></blockquote>\nI've always found this to be super-hard to achieve in any long-term group I've been in. As a teen I seemed to be the one guy who was assigning scores based on what my guy is like. And it never did me any good; I'd put all my high rolls into intelligence and charisma, only to have the more socially-dominant <i>player</i> out-influence me with his dumb-as-rocks barbarian.<br/><br/>ANd when I found a new group in adulthood, it was much the same. D&amp;D 3E was out, and everyone was going hardcore on the 'builds," where you have a high Cha because your Sorcerer needs a high Cha, and that's that. I remember I made a con-artisty Rogue with high Int and Cha, and low Wis--figuring he's too clever and charming for his own good. I really wanted a "talks his way into trouble, then talks his way out" deal for him. But I quickly figured out that the low Wis was just making it hard to spot guys sneaking up on me, or tel when someone's lying--so, with the pressure and approval of the group, I rebuilt him with a nice modest Wisdom like 12 or something.<br/><br/>But Jaden Augurfuris still has 8 Wisdom in my heart.<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192658/#Comment_192658" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-15T12:05:19+00:00" title="February 15, 2009 12:05PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a GM I look upon charisma as a lens on which to view the character.

We've sent his character off with a Hat of Disguise to do scouting just because it's funny. He met a couple of orcs and said "Hello, I'm an orc. I'm doing this, because this is what orcs do." Just change the species, and it worked equally well (badly) for ogres. My character thinks that Graham's is having him on with this geeky lock act, and has threatened to kill him if it turns out that's he is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193155/#Comment_193155" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T16:40:56+00:00" title="February 18, 2009  4:40PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the last couple of days I have been thinking about Alignments in a very similar light to what we did in here with Abilities.<br/><br/>Could I speak my mind about the subject in here or should I start a new thread?<br/><br/>(I suppose it is Graham's call.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193156/#Comment_193156" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T16:45:05+00:00" title="February 18, 2009  4:45PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd go with a whole new alignment-wank thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>I like Charisma - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8665/i-like-charisma/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="I like Charisma - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8665/i-like-charisma/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Yes, new thread, please!
