                    This is a silly idea that came to me last night.  I'm not doing anything with it, so I thought that I'd just throw it out there.<br/><br/>The character sheet is a series of five or six concentric circles.<br/><br/>In the innermost circle you write the character's name or title.<br/><br/>The next circle is divided in half and here you write the basic character conflict as two diametrically opposed ideas (like for Mal of Firefly fame it could be "browncoat volunteer" and "outlaw", for Buffy (seasons 1-3) it would be "slayer" and "blond high-school student").<br/><br/>The next circle outward is divided into three and I'm not sure what should go in here.  I've been thinking of body-mind-spirit type thing or maybe having the genre or setting have three different "attributes" and this is the circle that it goes in.<br/><br/>The next circle is divided into four and here you write four important relationships.<br/><br/>The next circle is divided into five and here you can write five important things that have happened in the past (like Fate with five phases).<br/><br/>The next circle is divided into six regions and is left blank at character creation.  This is where you can write aspects of the character that happen during play (ie experiences or resources earned).<br/><br/>The basic conflict resolution would be starting at the center and trying to go out, choosing one aspect from each circle if possible.  Then you do something with the aspects chosen (dice or coins or some such).  If you fail you "wound" the outer most aspect that you used.  A wounded aspect can be used in future tests, but it it is wounded again it is "destroyed" and erased.  If you succeed, you can "heal" an aspect used (starting with the innermost wounded aspect if you used more than one wounded aspect)  If you don't have an aspect to heal, you can then add an aspect to the outermost circle that has a spot (new aspects come in wounded).<br/><br/>And there you go.  Anyone can use this idea, I'm not going to use it but I thought that I'd share it.                </div>

                            Do the locations of the Aspects link them? That is, can I choose any aspect in the next ring out, or only one that touches a ring segment adjacent to it? I'm thinking that with the layers you have it might be limiting, but with more segments or rings that it might be a cool additional idea. Creating constraint on choices of combinations.<br/>

                            As I conceived of it, aspects of one circle are not link to a specific aspect on any other circle.  So you can choose any aspect that fits the situation on the next ring out (the numbers work better that way, but it might be neat to have a character as a binary tree so each aspect is linked to two sub-aspects).<br><br>I'm hoping that the situation and the fact that you are risking the aspects create interesting constraints on the choices.                        </br></br></div>

                            Just two thoughts:<br/><br/>Conflict is resolved by flipping coins against either another player or static target number decided by the GM based on the level of description (a "guard" is a difficulty of one while an "imperial guard of the 27th battalion" is worth two and "Darth Bob, Yellow Lord of Sith, Scourge of Outerrim and Destroyer of your Father" might be a three).  The coins used are a number of pennies and one nickel.  A nickel is always flipped for the last aspect.  On a tails that aspect may be wounded.  On a heads, an aspect might be gained.<br/><br/>The other thought is that aspects are not just made up (except for the name).  The setting is presented as a series of loresheets that can be purchased and unlocked using some kind of secondary currency.  They are plain prose for the most part with certain words <b>bolded</b>.  Once a loresheet has been purchased, those words in <b>bold</b> can then be used as character aspects.                        </div>

<p>Hey Aaron,</p>
<p>This idea has a lot of potential if you think of it as a user interface instead of just a way to organize data. Instead of tossing dice or coins and using aspects on the character sheet to get bonus dice/coins, toss them <em>on the sheet</em>. For example, you could combine this with <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2104" rel="nofollow">the coin toss system I mentioned elsewhere</a> and toss the coins on the sheet. If more than one coin lands on heads in a specific aspect (like "bounty hunter" or "relationship with girlfriend",) you get a +1, but you must describe how that aspect came into play. If more than one coin lands on tails in an aspect, that aspect is wounded in some way.</p>
<p>I got into this idea recently because of a book I mentioned before, <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, which has nothing to do with game design, but I saw great potential in it, especially in the concept of using mapping in the real world (where dice or coins land) to associate results in the fictional world. I tried something like this in my solo dungeoncrawl game I'm working on, first with simple mapping (tossing dice to find out where rooms are,) but then expanding it to a playmap with two concentric squares. If dice land near the edge, they represent doors; if they land in the middle square, they're monsters; and if they land in the center square, they're room features like statues, fountains, or treasure chests. I'm trying another gimmick as a rules tweak for my entry to the setting design competition, although I'm not sure how it will work yet. All I know is I'm assigning descriptors to each corner of the character and org sheets.</p>

                            And maybe you can contest spots on our player's sheets.  So you can put "Darth Vader" on Luke's sheet and now every time a coin lands on it something Darth Vader-y shows up.<br/><br/>Is it had to control the coin well enough to land on the sheet but have where it lands be more or less random?                        </div>

                            This reminds me of a massively-multiplayer computer game I worked on a few years ago called <a href="http://www.ea.com/official/thesims/thesimsonline/home/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">The Sims Online</a>.  We used a system called the <a href="http://sims.stratics.com/content/gameplay/needtoknow/friend_web/" rel="nofollow">Friendship Web</a> to tell at a glance what your relationships were like in the game.  Instead of trying to explain it, just take a look at the link.  It was designed to be simplistic and keep track of a whole lot of people, but it might spark something for your uses.<br/><br/>Chris B.                        </div>

                            Short note: I like Mike's anti-suggestion of the segments of the circles being used having to touch each other.  Just make sure that the segments are set up to allow multiple intersections, and then maybe introduce a mechanic that lets you shift aspects around, and you've got a very intriguing character system.                        </div>

                            All very good ideas; I love the character sheet!<br/><br/>Another idea, in addition to seeing characters as onions (layers upon layers), the same idea (and now sheet) could be used to model situations.  The outermost ring has five clues that not everything is alright.  The next most ring has four different flunkies that have to be overcame.  The ring of three has the traditional three challenges fleshed out for the situation.  The next ring is a choice between lesser evils.  And the innermost ring is the last challenge or reward.<br/><br/>Or for a dungeon, there could be five wilderness encounters.  A test of four elements.  Three guardian monsters.  Two final doors.  And one dragon.<br/><br/>For a more noir situation, five colorful characters, four crime scenes, three deadly secrets, two femme fatals, and one twist at the end (since the noir "hero" in my opinion NEVER understand what's really going on until it's too late).<br/><br/><i>ps This doesn't have to be filled in by a GM before the game.  Maybe the situation sheet is shared in the middle of the table and players take turns filling in the layers as rewards for successfully engaging the system (they get to throw a coin and if the coin lands on a blank spot they get to detail that spot, if it lands on a spot already filled in they have to engage with what is in that spot).</i> </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stack0v3rflow</cite>Another idea, in addition to seeing characters as onions (layers upon layers), the same idea (and now sheet) could be used to model situations.  The outermost ring has five clues that not everything is alright.  The next most ring has four different flunkies that have to be overcame.  The ring of three has the traditional three challenges fleshed out for the situation.  The next ring is a choice between lesser evils.  And the innermost ring is the last challenge or reward.</blockquote>
That's a pretty good idea. To expand on it: Each "scene" with a conflict is a segment in this "adventure sheet." It has its own "scene sheet," with the same layout, which you basically defeat as if it were another character. As you defeat each one, you work your way inwards towards the center of the adventure. Having structure and relatedness for items on the various rings of a particular sheet seems optional to me.<br/><br/>Of course, fifteen different sheets for one adventure might be kind of a lot of paper, but I'm more of an improv GM myself. It seems like a workable adventure design methodology, though.                        </div>

                            Note that, as long as you don't need the graphical proximity of the circle segments, the same can be produced using a pyramid, like <em>SotC's</em> skill pyramid.                        </div>

                            Right, Thor.  And as long as you don't need the 'what touches what' thing, if that's not an input to any mechanics, there's no reason to make people write sideways on the various sheets.  S'all I'm getting at.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Short note: I like Mike's anti-suggestion of the segments of the circles being used having to touch each other.  Just make sure that the segments are set up to allow multiple intersections, and then maybe introduce a mechanic that lets you shift aspects around, and you've got a very intriguing character system.</blockquote>
I think this is very cool too but the numbers 1-2-3-4-5 don't work as well.  I'd suggest 1-3-6 (three being more interesting a number to me than 2).  That way you have some symmetry but interesting choices at each layer.  If you wanted another layer I'd go with another 6, offset so that each one straddles two below.  If choices have to be made in a straight line, the 1-3-6-6 give twelve distinct choices that I count.<br/><br/>But maybe an asymmetrical field would give more interesting choices.  Some values would be weighted more than others.                        </div>

Or just have the blank be a bullseye and let the player decide how to partition each level.                        </div>

                            That's what I was thinking, with a largish number of lines available. This does mean that on any particular side you'd have only two potential adjacent segments that were shared with any other segment (with an unlimited number of non-shared segments). Not sure if that's problematic or not. Especially because the ring on the other side can be segmented differently. Seems like a lot of options.<br/>
