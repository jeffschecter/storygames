This one is harder for me to think about.  So much of our media revolves around conflict and there's an inherent tendency to want to simulate the conflict in rules.  But, you know, maybe conflict isn't what your story is really about.  Say you're running a buddy cop game where people get shot at and maybe even one of the cops dies.  That's all cool, but... maybe the game is about the relationship that develops between these two cops, and all the mechanics are focused on that.  Maybe the conflicts that happen in the game are just color, y'know?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure if this was in the big list of cows, but I wanted to hone in on it, because I've seen mentions of Jeepform that it's been done and very well, to pick on Jason, like this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Just to echo Claudia and Christian, look to Jeepform and related traditions for Death <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.  I played a Death <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> game at Viking Con for the first time.  I am going to be playing lots more because Death <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is<i>hot sauce.</i></blockquote>\nAnd I feel like calling bullshit.  Claudia linked to <a href="http://www.telegram.olsing.com/?p=20" rel="nofollow">this game, as an example</a> and it's rife with conflict as far as I can tell, with only examples of play to go on.  There's the conflict between players and the GM when the players try to make the story about a conflict instead of about love. In fact the game is about this when it asks "Where will they go wrong?" ("they" being the players)<br/><br/>But even on another level, if you play it perfect, there still must be conflict. Maybe, <i>probably</i>, it's "How to I focus and express love?" which can come from the player, or the character.<br/><br/>I don't want to pick on that one game, or even Jeepform (though the latter is what I'd like to hear more examples of).  My gut reaction is "You're just saying there's no conflict because there's no villains or antagonist or guns, but there's still conflict, either internal or subtle, pulling and tugging on players or characters because that's what you <i>need</i> to tell a story (at least an interesting one)."<br/><br/>I want to be proven wrong and have my mind opened.

I am reminded of the Robbinson novel with the can of beans "instead of" a character.  The can of beans becomes a character.  Stories need characters.  Stories and games need conflict.  It's an essential element.<br/><br/><em>However</em>, I can totally see a game that does not have <em>rules</em> that are <em>about</em> conflict.  It is very possible to have a game that describes rules for how things happen in the fiction, and conflicts can emerge organically from that.  This is hard.  It requires very carefully-balanced rules which create conflict in the fruitful void.  They tend to look and feel 'fiddly' and it takes a while to grasp what's going on, because the <em>thing you care about</em> is not directly manipulated by rules about what you care about.  You have to kind of get a feel for how things work, and then you start seeing how you can make things work to affect the <em>thing you care about</em>.<br/><br/>Additionally, I am very hopeful for games which discard the oft-repeated definition of 'conflict' as 'a conflict of interest between the players at the table as to how the fiction will proceed.'  I find this definition to be utter bollocks.  There are a thousand good reasons to build, manipulate, and resolve conflicts that aren't a dick-waving contest between you and your fellow players.  This is a good venue, I hope, for more collaborative play, and I'm looking in this direction for some of the Next Big Things in design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110406/#Comment_110406" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T12:45:08+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 12:45PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>"How to I focus and express love?"</blockquote>\nIn the interest of talking about what conflict is, I don't think this is one.  It's a question.  Until there's more than one suggested answer on the table, there's no conflict.<br/><br/>Maybe someone's internal state/psychology/drives/motivations will suggest to them two or more answers; then they have an internal conflict.  Maybe the characters will suggest two or more answers.  Then there's a character conflict.  Maybe the setting will suggest two or more answers.  Then the characters are in conflict with the setting.

As you might guess, I think this identification is rather spurious.  However, it's an identification that has sunk deep into the indie groupthink, and it's hard to root out, or even talk about the topic without running into its associated assumptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110412/#Comment_110412" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T12:54:04+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 12:54PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another question...<br/><br/>A game without conflict... what's the point, what happens, and why do I care about it?<br/><br/>-B                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110416/#Comment_110416" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T13:14:03+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  1:14PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>There's a semantic problem, which I think Malcolm Sheppard alluded to, with the word.

I mean I go on vacation or have dinner with friends and enjoy it precisely when there isn't conflict. Or isn't there?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>"How to I focus and express love?"</blockquote>\nIn the interest of talking about what conflict is, I don't think this is one.

The thing is, it's not just you asking yourself, in this case it's being asked of two people, playing two characters (who's love for each other is a firm fact), with another player directing the whole thing to keep it on track. Because even if I know you think to yourself "You have a solid answer which you're confident in" there's still tension on not just whether it will be recieved externally properly (a conflict of whether there will be conflict, I guess) but whether "you" can put the thought into words that expresses it as complete as the solid answer. This wouldn't happen if the question was "How do I make breakfast" even though there are still tons of options and room for failure and making other people unhappy. It's just that, even though it's the most important meal of the day\u2122 it's just not as weighty and complex as love, so there's not as much potential conflict in the question (and whatever the conflict that results most likely won't be very interesting). But certain questions are starting points for conflict, precisely because they aren't being answered by a single person in their head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110423/#Comment_110423" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T13:29:59+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  1:29PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>What really happens when there's no conflict?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>So, setting aside the issue of the quotes you included in your first post (which are not really relevant to this question), I think that this is a pretty loaded question.

A subspecies of this cow is "There must be conflicts in the Shared Imagined Space (in hippy games)." For example, suppose each person has a character. anyone can describe facts facts and events in the world and describe how his own character appears to behave. In each person's head they might very well imagine internal-conflicts their character is experiencing "Should I ask for paper or plastic? Do I love my wife? Should I keep on living?" etc. but these are all kept hidden as much as possible. Noone makes any attempt to understand or influence or communicate the internal conflicts to each other. There are conflicts, there are conflicts and narratives in the Personal Imagined Spaces, but the shared imagined space is just prosaic facts and color.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110431/#Comment_110431" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T14:20:31+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  2:20PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>But I think the interesting question it still raises for me, is it possible?

This thread went somewhere else entirely.  I'm not even sure where to begin.<br/><br/>From the other thread:\n<blockquote>However, what I said is not that the story would have "no conflict," but that the conflicts are not what the story is ABOUT. They are not the key focus the way they are in most roleplaying games. You don't need to have a system for resolving them or anyone assigned to provide an antagonistic role because that's not really all that important.  I don't think this is just throwing a sheet over conflict and pretending it's not there while we whistle past it. It could be because we're genuinely interested in other things, like exploring themes or character development, and don't really care how the conflict resolves. I think a movie like The Fountain is a great example. Or the first part of 2001: A Space Odyssey (before the conflict with Hal), with the monkeys and the business people in space. Is it really interesting to us which monkeys win the waterhole? Do we really care whether the businessman impresses his friends or is able to hide his real motivations for going to the moon? No, not really. Those are not interesting conflicts. But we are still interested in exploring what happens, so we focus on things other than conflict. Like, wow that monkey's really acting crazy. Or, sweet, let's have people, like, walk on the ceiling and stuff, because they're in SPACE!</blockquote>\nSo when people are insisting "Well, you have to have conflict, but what I really mean was no mechanics about conflict" I think you're watering down my point.  Whether you have mechanics about them or not, you can still decide that play is about conflicts... or you can decide that play is about something else.  Do I need to write up an example of play?<br/><br/>Here's a scene (not a really good scene, but it's just an example):<br/><br/>P1: Okay, so you're walking along the corridor of your spaceship, right?  When you look out the windows and you see that aliens are attacking!<br/>P2: Oh, crap!  What do they look like?  They're the ones who abandoned that city we found, with really spikey glowing architecture?<br/>P1: Definitely the same ones, or at least these ships look similar.  Kinda like spiney crystal manta rays made of light.<br/>P2: Oh, do they have tails like manta rays too, that can, like, knock spaceships about with a single swipe?<br/>P1: Oh yeah.  That's totally great.  They just took out one of your escort ships.  Smack!<br/>P2: Sucks for us!  Dude, it should totally crash into the side of our ship too!  Send people flying everywhere!<br/>P1: Yeah, it totally causes the antigrav generator to cut out, now you're floating down the hallway!<br/>P2: Ha!  Okay, well we probably have retractable emergency ladders on the wall, for just these kinds of situations.<br/>P1: Sure.  And there's a pole that runs alongside them, which you can clip onto with the carabiner on your belt.<br/>P2: Cool, that'll keep me from floating away every time the ship shudders.  So I guess I'll make my way towards the flight deck.<br/>etc.<br/><br/>Both players seem like they're having a blast.  And there's... no conflict in this scene.  The aliens are attacking!  Ships are getting knocked from the sky!  Conflict is happening all around them!  But the character in question is not really facing conflict.  And the players aren't fighting over the narrative, they're building on each other.  I think you can totally have entire games that are structured like this, either with a rules system that supports this kind of play, or just because the players have decided that's how they want to do things.  They want to focus on, say, cool little bits of the setting or exciting description or performing kick-ass stunts or emulating a certain genre or creating a really cool story, rather than conflict.<br/><br/>Note, I'm not saying this style of play is better or even enjoyable for everyone, I'm just saying that it exists and is enjoyable for many people.  It's also not a style of play that is commonly designed for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110444/#Comment_110444" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T14:49:55+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  2:49PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is of course also that teeny weeny thing that conflict is the most basic currency of a story.<br/><br/>And even if you stop a scene immediately when conflict appears, as William suggests, it hasn't gone.

The question may be intimately tied into and related to the conflict, but it <em>isn't</em> the conflict, at least not entirely.  In order to construe the love question as a conflict, we need to also include that there are two people involved in the situation which raises the question, and that one of these people is going to take action on a feeling of love, which may or not be received well.  All of that is part of the conflict.<br/><br/>The question and the situation are both necessary but not sufficient conditions on their own.  Together, <em>maybe</em> they're sufficient to constitute a conflict, but it's hard for me to rule out things I haven't thought of that are required.  From that basis, I can imagine games that are about situation without questions.  How one would do it, I don't know -- but if you could, there would be no conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110464/#Comment_110464" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T15:41:20+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  3:41PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2007 3:49PM by James_Nostack.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/><br/>Within the fiction, but not between the players. </blockquote>\nOh.<br/><br/>You mean: playing a game where there aren't any conflicts on the player-level?

The point of karaoke isn't to produce a good sounding song as end result of your efforts, the point of karaoke is to <i>get up and sing, damn it!</i> Even if you can't sing, it doesn't matter, because you're not there to sing well, you're just there to be the one singing, to experience a song as <i>an activity that you can do</i> rather than as a commodity that you can acquire. Besides, <i>no one</i> can sing, so why worry about it?<br/><br/>RPGs are the same way. They give us a chance to take storytelling back from the "experts" and <i>make our own damned entertainment</i> for a change.<br/><br/>Which is what makes them a Force For Good.<br/>\n<blockquote>Or, another thing, travel books, at least some National Geographic articles (the stuff that doesn't point out "But this wway of life/corner of the world is under assault"), and other stuff like that.

It's the immersion-thingy.<br/><br/>As for removing of conflicts in fiction; I think it's hard, but doable. A scenario (actual, played this, but it was a long ago) about a host of friends gathering to remember their dead friend, which turns into reflecting themselves, can be a very conflict-less. Sure, there are possibilities for conflict, more or less, depending on how we want to define the conflict. But there's also a very real possibility of not having conflicts. I'm tempted on the idea of writing a scenario in which there are no real conflicts between the characters.

Oh. Well. Sure, you could probably do that. I think that in a lot of traditional games there's not any genuine conflict on the player-level. (Viz. - the Dungeon Master who talks up how deadly the monsters are, and then cheats to keep your character alive so you can complete the epic story.) Wasn't there already sort of a joke game about this, where the player invents weird ways for his spaceship pilot to die, and the GM says, "Okay, fine, it looks like you're about to die--and then, you don't! Game on, bitch!"<br/></blockquote>\nWeirdly, the existence of a joke about the subject supports Jonathon Walton's assertion that this type of play is favored by some segment of players.<br/><br/>I'd go further and say that a<b>large</b>segment of players like this sort of playstyle.<br/><br/>I think the commonly expressed "pure" form of this playstyle mostly exists in the minds of theoreticians. Actual fudging is one part of a complex process with aspects of interpersonal negotiation and on the spot hermeneutics. It is not really just the GM imposing his/her will no matter what comes up on the dice.<br/><br/>Based on my intentional (i.e. I went and watched strangers and took notes) observations of traditional games, the general steps are as follows:<br/><br/>1) Negotiation of the event and the system to be used. ("Is there a red button on the console?" "Can I use my button mashing skill?" "It's a small button, roll 15 or higher." "I pictured myself right next to it, though." "Okay, 12." "Okay then.")<br/>2) Resolution using the system of the agreed upon event. (*Button mashing roll is 11*)<br/>3) Interpretation of the results. ("Hm. You hit the button, but it only sticks bout halfway -- you'll need another turn to get that sucker in.")<br/>4) Integration into the flow of play. ("I whale on the button." "That's right -- you can't dodge the can of pasta!")<br/><br/>Note that in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, a roll of 12+ probably is a success and a roll of 5 might be an absolute failure, because the GM isn't inspired by those numbers in the same way as s/he is inspired by an 11. And in many games, all dice -- even "secret" rolls -- are in the open and are interpreted openly and collectively, because interpretation is often smoothed by collaboration. But it is almost *never* a case of the GM ruling a straightforward success regardless of what number shows up. Numbers have a lot of power to inspire the imagination.<br/><br/>These are the things that happen in real traditional RPGs, as played by people I do not personally know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110562/#Comment_110562" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T04:53:17+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  4:53AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>Extending this beyond our hobby, a ton of Hollywood action movies operate on the same principle: "Oh no, Mr. Die-Hard is in trouble (wink wink)!

There's conflict in the narrative, but its considered unimportant. Making the outcome known is an example of a technique to make the conflict less important. The space-alien example above I think is driving at this as well. <br/><br/>2. There's conflict in the Personal Imagined Spaces, but there's no universally agreed upon conflict in the Shared Imagined Space.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110767/#Comment_110767" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T14:34:46+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  2:34PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>So...

The thing in that thread was making the game not <i>about</i> conflict, not removing conflict altogether and it was pretty well covered.  The idea it spawned though, was what if you removed conflict. It sounded like some of the Jeep talk was going in that direction too, but brought back in line with clarification on what Death <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> meant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
