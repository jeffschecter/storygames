I got some good feedback on that from friends at Dragonmeet who said that it didn't really showcase what GUMSHOE is about. I also tried some of the short indie demos at the Forge/IPR booth at Gen Con and looked at the kind of thing Collective Endeavour were doing. Most of these guys were doing 15 minute demos. <br/><br/>Many of the indie games demonstrate radically new concepts and designs and have a heavy mesh between the mechanic and the fiction. My impression is that Trail is rather lighter touch than this and that part of the idea is to let the fiction flow by making the mechanics less obvious in play. So whilst in Dogs you push forward the dice as you make your bid, in Trail, I'll give you the core clue because I know your character has the appropriate ability (although in the demo I will explain that this is what I've done). I also make it clear that players can expand on what a skill means for extra benefits. Library Use, for example, can be used to find a particular book, to get a pool of points in another skill<br/><br/>So there was a bit of a dichotomy. I wanted to show people how it worked but not make things too obvious. The only way I felt I could do this was by running a more extended demo in which players have several opportunities to experience how things work. There is also the issue that the loss of stability is more scary to the player if it happens in several steps, starting slowly and then ramping up. <br/><br/>I always write a demo set in the city where I'm running it. This has worked well in all GUMSHOE incarnations, especially with Esoterrorists and Fear Itself where it's set at Gen Con and is in fact the same scenario but from two different points of view. I give full character sheets and talk about the game for 5 minutes, explaining about general and investigative skills, health and stability and drives. I also have a little tent in front of each player with their characters name facing front and a potted biography facing the player.<br/><br/>I've decided that three scenes are about the right length. The first scene introduces the mystery and has a core clue, the second scene is another clue scene and the final scene is an action scene where the players put it altogther and have to make a choice. The choice is pretty brutal in many cases, i.e. which one of us dies, but this is part of the maturity of Mythos gaming.<br/><br/>The whole thing fits in 30 minutes if I hurry people along or 45 if I don't or 90 minutes if I ad lib some extra scenes.<br/><br/>I think the reason it works is because people get a proper story with a beginning, middle and end, they get to see the different mechanics in play, core and supplementary clues, general skills, stability and health loss and they also, if they're brave, get to try to use skills in less obvious ways to get benefits. Also, because it is a horror game, as mentioned earlier, there is the ramping up from safe, to disturbed, to horrified that is hard to achieve in a short period of time.<br/><br/>The other thing I've thought about is who is the demo for. At first, nobody had heard of GUMSHOE so there was a lot of explaining to do. Now many of the players already have read about or even own the game but they want a chance to see how it works before they try it at home. Seeing a whole scenario, albeit a very short one, allows them to get this experience. And that's also why I do it for 5 players at a time, so it more closely resembles a proper game.<br/><br/>There is an issue about the number of gamers we reach. 45 minutes is a considerable period of time at a con so I only saw about 9*5=45 players. I'm the only demonstrator we have so I can only do 2 or 3 a day if I want to do anything else at the con. <br/><br/>In fact, I'm wondering next year whether I ought to do something more concentrated called "So you want to run GUMSHOE", a 15 minute primer for GMs who want to use the system. After all, each GM is 5 players and if I can do 45 GMs, then that's 225 players as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225698/#Comment_225698" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T08:15:19+00:00" title="August 19, 2009  8:15AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a GM-only demo is a fantastic idea!

Last year, at Dragonmeet, I ran Steve's demo after playing in it (although less well). His only notes were scribbled words: lockpick, Conan Doyle. The 30 - 45 minute slot works well. <br/><br/>When I ran it, I did three things slightly differently. Firstly, I didn't do the 5-minute run through the character sheet, which was a bit long when I'd sat through it. Instead, I gave a very quick overview, explaining things as they came up during the game. Secondly, I was better looking. Thirdly, rather than giving them the clues, I let them say they were using their skills to reveal them. <br/><br/>There's a few different subsystems to demonstrate: normal clue, core clue, general skill roll, stability, combat. It's good to have a mental checklist.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>P.S. A demo where you can slot a customer in, as the GM, would be great. It wouldn't be too hard with Trail of Cthulhu and it'd make them feel special. (And, um, perhaps break the demo, but anyway.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/e4mafia" title="e4mafia"><img alt="e4mafia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/259/nGW248JRC0OPG.GIF"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/e4mafia">e4mafia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437844/#Comment_437844" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-27T10:53:01+00:00" title="August 27, 2014 10:53AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would you mind sharing the demo?

So I'll point at the ability which gives them more information. I'll go for a 0-point clue to start, such as "those papers are all written in a language you studied at college", or "this reminds you of something the librarian at the Miskatonic once told you", which leads to a language or library use ability. Given the short nature of the scenario, I'll also encourage spends with the "this is a demo, what are you keeping the points for" line. I'll also move things along in time so they don't get stuck in the planning cycle, jumping into the middle of a scene. <br/><br/>- if someone is being awkward, or just an idiot, which happens very rarely, my tested approach has been to confront their behaviour directly, explain how it is derailing the session and how they might contribute more constructively. Generally they have a least one good idea which can be built on. I'll use that to give them a way out of just having made them look silly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
