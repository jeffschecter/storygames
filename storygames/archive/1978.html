                    It's been attempted many times before. Let's see what this board does with the puzzle.<br/><br/>I'd start by removing morality from the Glamour vs. Banality conflict. What's good for fey is not necessarily good for humans and vice versa. Even if the Unseelie are evil by human standards, they may still be the best hope for fey-kind.                </div>

                            My first preference would be to get rid of the twee-victorianism in the setting and have the fairys based more on earlier folktales.<br/><br/>I'd also be tempted to do a Nine Worlds style resolution, where your chosen method of solving any conflict had to be either glamour or banality.                        </div>

                            I think one of the first things to do with any game of Changeling: The Awesome is to divide out which of the five games in one you want to play this time. Are you going with the waking dream angle? The childhood wonder angle? The ancient myths alive in the modern world angle? The art-poseur my vision is better than your sold out life angle? Some of them can work together, but a lot of the friction I used to get in Changeling came from the vast number of expectations and textually-supported different themes going on through the game. <br/><br/>Aside from those, some of the things I've considered doing unto Changeling in the past include: <br/><br/>Invasion of the Body Snatchers: Sidhe are body snatchers, they steal the bodies they inhabit. (The books sometimes played with this, but not much.) Even commoners are sort of dual-spirits, part fae and part human in spirit and thus due for all sorts of split personality potential. So I'd like to play a game where the glamour/banality split comes not from world view or actions, but from the war between the human soul and the fae soul. I'd want a mechanic more like Humanity in Sorcerer than G/B, with a too high score meaning your humanity wins and kills the inner fae and a too low score meaning the fae wins out and you go off to the land of the little people. The point of the game then comes around the clashing goals, social ties, and human pressures of being caught between two worlds. Sidhe would be particularly terrifying in this setup, as they are the other thing, the nasty thing, that is utterly inhuman and yet inhabiting the world of humanity. <br/><br/>To Reign in Hell: Speaking of nasty sidhe, a revolutionary commoners setup game could be awesome. The sidhe are inhuman demon-things that have come from Arcadia because they were exiled for their crimes after losing a war. They are monstrous, terrible, powerful, and glorious. The commoners, much closer to humanity, are trying to stop the sidhe from taking over their holds and using their terrible beauty to break their wills. For this I'd probably use a system like Burning Empires game-progression, to track the infiltration, subversion, and war as the two groups war for dominance in an area. Burn up your own city and freeholds, chose your side and your power players, and the go to fucking war.                        </div>

For me, as soon as you take out the kiddie angle, almost all the other themes work together.  The waking dream stems from the ancient myths, and is the source of artistic creativity.  It's the "and children are closer to the dream" combined with "the dream is better than reality" that kills the thematic knot.<br/><br/>The thing that Changeling always needed was relationship mechanics.  Unlike vampires, who can feed-and-run, Changelings tend to set up long-term relationships with the muses that they harvest glamour from.  Those relationships should be the vital center of the game.  I always wanted changelings fighting over territory, and that territory defined by the glamour produced there.  So artist communities are prized gems, and so on.<br/><br/>I'd also like to crank the mythic dial up a bit, but that's just me.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>Yea, they can. But they don't without some work. For example: is your knight a knight in shining armor or a Jedi knight? If you don't give the mythic/dream split a hairy eyeball before the game starts you can easily end up with both. And sometimes it works (if you're lucky or did it on purpose) but other times its... not so good. <br/><br/>Also, with the relationships, I'd want a "grow or burn" tradeoff for musing and ravaging to give a struggle between the slow grow and the fast cash. When the duke is about to invade and you don't have juice, are you willing to ravage the pretty red head girl you've been training for years, ruining her so that you can fight him, or do you let him have her so that she stays whole? If you want a political game of Changeling, that's a good route to start with. <br/><br/>Thing about it is that I often found politics in Changeling to be more a hold over from Vampire than something intrinsic to the game I played. In many faerie stories we hear about kings and queens and such, but only as dressing to make them more wondrous. Actual politics don't play into it that much, and if you're trying to get Tam Lin or even Arthur (in which family drama is far more central than political maneuvers), it may not help you. So, for a more fairy tale game I'd actually remove a lot of the resource management and make it really simple -- kings are rich, knights are in the middle, commoners are poor, etc. Polarize it, blow it into fairy tale proportions, intensify through exaggeration. <br/><br/>Something else I'd like to work into the more mythic style game (which I think Dark Ages took a stab at) is the geas and the way they totally have the potential to make story. Every fae should have a list of idiosyncratic, dynamic, bizzare, and totally unavoidable mystical oaths, restrictions, and vulnerabilities that they must contend with. In the midst of wielding your godlike power you should have to stop to count the coins that a kid spills on the floor. For this a system like Nobilis's 'get points when you suffer' would probably be golden.                        </div>

<p>So, me, I think that playing humans in contect with the fey, rather than playing the fey themselves, would really electrify Changeling. There's a lot of majesty and power in their sort of mythical inscrutability, but you lose all of that when you're <em>inside</em> it.</p>

                            Shreyas, <br/><br/>True, you can also say that of all the WoD games. (In fact I have said it of all the WoD games....)<br/><br/>There is also a point in playing the monster, the other, and the alien. You just have to make that point part of the game you're playing, rather than hoping it comes out eventually.                        </div>

Ooo.  Dude, I could rebuild the game off of just that.<br/><br/>And Shreyas, yeah, there's a fat load of those stories, but that's not Changeling's "thing".  All of the WoD games are based off of the reversal "you play the supernatural other in the encounter with the mundane humans."  So I mean, yeah I agree with you, it's just that's not Changeling.  That's some other cool game with fairies. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            See, I'd steal from everything and cobble it all together.<br/>
<br/>
First, I'd look at other rpg treatments of the theme, including Dark Ages: Fae, which is a lot simpler and rawer, and a better game for it.<br/>
<br/>
Other things I'd look at would include Deliria, Everway, Mortal Coils, and Don't Rest Your Head, for starters.<br/>
<br/>
Then, I'd grab the Pitch Session idea from PtA, because Brand's right -- the first step is to decide which game you're playing. Changeling never made up its mind and never quite worked as a "you decide" sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
One thing Changeling never quite clicked with was the idea of the two layers, the fae world and the mortal world, and what you see depending on which filter you're using. So, the kid dodging traffic could be a young sidhe knight fighting dragons. I could get into that kind of game.<br/>
<br/>
I could get into a game where everyone played the mortals, but I'm not sure that's how I'd awesome-ify Changeling. One of the big issues I have with White Wolf is that it promises powerful alien PCs, and never delivers. [Rant censored, as it's old hat and beside the point here.] And, anyway, once you've done the standard Urban Fantasy story (normal, but cool, people learn that there's magic out there, yadda, yadda), well, then what? If you don't have a cool answer for that, it's basically the same story over and over again.<br/>
<br/>
I could go with the Glamour/Banality thing, but so not the way Changeling did it. I mean, okay, I can get "The first performance of a new song is full of Glamour, but when it's the Top 40s Pop Chart, it's Banal." But, I so cannot get "This is a Treasure full of Glamour. You use it by destroying it and removing its Glamour forever from the world." Nah, better to lose the Glamour/Banility thing than that. (And, no glamor from the Renaissance to the Lunar Landing? Say what?)<br/>
<br/>
For something old and raw, without worrying about the urban fantasy / split level thing, I'd go with Dark Ages: Fae and Everway, maybe with a bit of Mortal Coils thrown in -- haven't gotten familiar enough with that last to know for sure how it would click.<br/>
<br/>
If I wanted something more split level, but dark? Seriously, I'd see what I could use from Don't Rest Your Head. It's got the right edge.<br/>
<br/>
For something more urban fantasy? Everway or Sorcerer. Yeah, if you're working with that whole body stealing theme, and you're maybe thinking the focus should be on the mortals.... hm, yeah, there's probably a fae mini-supplement for Sorcerer in there, if someone hasn't already done it.<br/>
<br/>
So, what game are we playing when we're playing Changeling?                        </div>

                            One of the things that I didn't feel worked quite as expected was that changelings were supposed to be <i>changelings</i> - half human - rather than just fae.  Changeling society was, by a large margin, the biggest and most important example of faerie in the setting - the other pole of the continuum was missing.<br/><br/>So instead have an active and powerful kingdom of faerie.  And the changelings - faerie children raised by humans and human babies raised by faeries - would exist in the overlap between the faerie kingdom and the mortal world.  Really play up the hybrid angle.  Humans see the world in mundane fashion, by the cold light of reason.  But the faeries see everything in terms of myth, dream or just plain alien logic.  And changelings suffer the cognitive dissonance of knowing both points of view to be true.<br/><br/>You might even be able to have some of the "X games in one" competing for the <i>characters</i> attention rather than the players.  The changeling would be able to choose their reality, to a certain extent at least.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thomas T</cite>One of the things that I didn't feel worked quite as expected was that changelings were supposed to be<i>changelings</i>- half human - rather than just fae.  Changeling society was, by a large margin, the biggest and most important example of faerie in the setting - the other pole of the continuum was missing.<br/><br/>So instead have an active and powerful kingdom of faerie.  And the changelings - faerie children raised by humans and human babies raised by faeries - would exist in the overlap between the faerie kingdom and the mortal world.  Really play up the hybrid angle.  Humans see the world in mundane fashion, by the cold light of reason.  But the faeries see everything in terms of myth, dream or just plain alien logic.  And changelings suffer the cognitive dissonance of knowing both points of view to be true.<br/><br/>You might even be able to have some of the "X games in one" competing for the<i>characters</i>attention rather than the players.  The changeling would be able to choose their reality, to a certain extent at least.</blockquote>
IIRC, the nWoD Changeling game is going to do something like this.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>So, me, I think that playing humans in contect with the fey, rather than playing the fey themselves, would really electrify Changeling. There's a lot of majesty and power in their sort of mythical inscrutability, but you lose all of that when you're<em>inside</em>it.</blockquote>
This was going to be my first suggestion for this thread, which I have been neurotically avoiding. Almost every great faerie story -- even including lots of the modern, urban fantasy stuff that Changeling claims to be based on -- has a human as the protagonist. The world of the setting is almost always revealed through the eyes of that human, who somehow steps across the line into Faerie. And along similar lines, humans always have peculiar importance or 'powers' that the Faeries somehow lack -- in Changeling itself, the current best candidate is imagination. Humans have imagination, Faeries have derivative mimicry. This means among other things that humans might be able to solve problems or bring about changes, encouraging their centrality to a certain kind of story.<br/><br/>In light of some of the other spot on comments about how the Changeling (i.e. Human/Faerie) aspect was never really played up, I will also point out that the story arc I describe above is suitable to a pre and post-Chrysalis <i>Changeling</i> -- a human who gets so involved in the world of Faerie that they are touched by it, or a human who is revealed to have been a half-breed all along, etc.                        </div>

                            Daniel, <br/><br/>This reminds me, origin stories rock. They're all the rage in movies these days, and everyone always gets into em. I think you can get a lot of mileage out of origin stories for WoD style beasties of all types. However, due to the setup of many of the WoD games the origin was played as the prequel and the character started the game proper already fully in the skin. (A newb, certainly, but already a thing.) <br/><br/>So doing a Changeling story where the characters start off as mortals and all have a chance to Chrys, resist Chrys, and either return to humanity or go off to faerie land, could have some massive potential. I have thoughts of transhumanist and posthuman mythic stories here, with some folks falling back into humanity, some moving on, some getting stuck in the middle... could be awesome. <br/><br/>(Ditto Vampire, btw. For those who remember the 1st ed of Vampire the picture story that ran through the book was about two origins and two ends, with little in the middle. I always found this an odd contrast to most games of Vampire, in which the origin is in the prequel and the end is avoided stringently.)                        </div>

<p>Something that, I just realised, always enlivens this sort of thing is an untouchable mystery.</p>
<p>Like the disappearance of the Sidhe.</p>
<p>What if every Changeling game was like, you do a sequence of that "trapped between mortal and fey society" thing for a while, but you have something, an iconic prop, maybe it's a white disc moving across a black sky, pushed by an unpredictable trigger, and as it passes its zenith and goes into decline, the fey exodus begins. First, the kings and queens of the Sidhe shut their chamber doors and they never reopen. Fairy palaces go up in whorls of smoke or drifts of autumn leaves.</p>
<p>Fey society crumbles, as more and more courts silently shutter their homes and leave the human worlds for refuges in distant fairy lands, and <em>they never explain why.</em></p>

<p>Nother one -</p>
<p>The fey themselves are beings of passion and immortality and paper-thin glamour. Humans are mortal and practical and strong like the earth.</p>
<p>Between them are the changelings.</p>
<p>It hurts too much for the fey to tough the mortal world for too long - in the face of transience, the objects of their passion often die, and their hearts are drowned in grief. Mortals cannot operate in Faerie because its logic is too personal and unpredictable for them.</p>
<p>So, the fey steal children of man and bring them to their world, immerse them in their culture, and exchange them for fairy children who are brought up just the same, among humans.</p>
<p>These children, as they grow to adulthood, serve as bridges between the worlds, and...do stuff. Inscrutable stuff. Maybe they have, like, oddly forceful dreams and urges that push them slowly back to their homelands.</p>
