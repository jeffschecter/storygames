There's even an "editor" role that lets you recap, reframe, jump-cut, and do other meta-level structural functions. It was really neat, and the underlying game-mechanical currency was very elegantly fine-tuned.

The game went perfectly and the economy was flowing smoothly. <br/><b>Friday Evening: </b>I administered Shock, first time actually playing the game.

The mixture of Faster than Light travel, Fragmentation and Colonialism led to some interesting scenes, though I didn't pull my own weight.<br/><b>Friday night: </b> We didn't have enough people for 1001 nights, so I jumped into Bills excellent Dungeon World game. It ended in the wee hours of the morning, but it was very much fun.<br/><b>Saturday Morning: </b>We didn't have enough people for Archipelago, so I played a game of Project NPT, followed by some setting creation for Spark.  <br/><b>Saturday Afternoon: </b>I got to run my first game of Dogs in the Vineyard, with one of the four players having never played an RPG before that point. The initiation scenes resonated, especially with the one character who got the trait "I shot my daddy dead in church".  I will admit that it was a tad rough to use the resolution mechanic for the first time, but it worked out great.<br/><b>Saturday Evening: </b> I administered a 9 player game of Microscope, using my <a href="http://www.genesisoflegend.com/2012/08/the-massive-microscope-hack/" rel="nofollow">little hack </a> of the game.

Would you do it again, and what would you do differently, if anything, to make it even better?<br/></blockquote>\nOoh, man, that's a lot to answer there. Quick, huh? Let's see how I do. <br/><br/>We were able to deliver on the goal that we set for ourselves: create a complete story that reacts to the players choices organically and nurtures character development. In the course of accomplishing those goals I discovered a whole new set of goals that I have for development. <br/><br/>As for what I would do differently, I would love to have an extra GM for every session whose sole job is to handle administrative tasks. Run character sheets around, answer questions about rules, and coordinate stuff between GMs. <br/><br/>We worked hard to make the different tables actions feel like they were part of the greater web of the event, and I feel like we could have done better there. I don't know how to conquer that yet, but we'll get there. <br/><br/>And the bane of most LARPs: pacing. Man, pacing was a giant pain in the ass. Some tables would complete their goals before others, and it was hard to find ways to keep those players engaged without resorting to filler material. We need to work on techniques to get that to work better. <br/><br/>I would also limit player choice a little more when it comes to character selection. I made the insane decision to allow any official MWP datafile be used, which meant that we had some players struggle with trying to fit their favorite character into a cosmic battle. While I grew up reading Spider-man fight Thanos on the regular, a lot of our players had a hard time squaring that circle in their heads. <br/><br/>I would definitely do this again. Hell, we're already planning on doing it again. (Really, really early stages of planning, but planning) I'd love to have the same guys along, if they're all willing. Mark, Frank and Tim were all heroes and really drove the game into amazing directions. <br/>\n<blockquote><br/>I also got to run a game of Eternity, my soon-to-be-finished (I swear!)

Its a great game, and I say that have been monkey stomped by everyone at the table...</blockquote>\nI didn't get to hear you bubbling--can you give me a quick gush?<br/></blockquote>\nSure <br/>- Rachel is a very thoughtful, well prepared GM. She has a deceptively quiet style, and is sometimes filled with pure evil gut punch.<br/>- She let the characters develop their relationships before heading into the horror.  This made parts of the horror that much more poignant/gipping.<br/>- The skins and character jobs seem specifically chosen to make a more adult oriented drama, rather than Monsterheart's tendency to push the angst to 11.  <br/>- I definitely felt some bleed beween myself and my character, which helped make the horror feel more real.<br/><br/>The game was full of win.<br/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge" title="EarthenForge"><img alt="EarthenForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge">EarthenForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407348/#Comment_407348" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-26T08:09:22+00:00" title="February 26, 2013  8:09AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff, you are making me blush!

Brennan, Brendan, and Michael McDowell were great team members and we are also already planning more goodness in the future\u2014I want to revise this campaign and do it again, and also do something similar with Mouse Guard.<br/><br/>Aside from GMing Bulldogs! I ran Monsterwarts, as noted above, and a new Burning Wheel one-shot. The BW game worked better than it should have considering how little work I put into it. We didn't touch any of the detailed subsystems, because I had six players, many of them completely new to Burning, but as usual the Hub shone through amazingly well. I will definitely run "The Three Trials of the Seven Pilgrims" again, with only slight revision.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407406/#Comment_407406" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-26T14:56:21+00:00" title="February 26, 2013  2:56PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2013 2:57PM by Emily_Care.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At Dreamation, I ran non-stop jeepform games with the rock-solid Sex &amp; Bullets crew and inspired &amp; enthusiastic players.
