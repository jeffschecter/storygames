Current doc <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44973653/WTHI.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Elevator pitch <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44973653/WTHI%20pitch.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and first AP report (from London Indie RPG meet-up, Saturday Sep 15th) <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=13854#p149302" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I\u2019d be happy to hear folks\u2019 thoughts; better yet, if anyone fancies running it with their gaming group that would be great. I\u2019m aware that the concept is a bit \u2018out there\u2019, but, if the response from the playtest last month is anything to go by, they will find it rewarding. <br/><br/>The main points I\u2019m looking for feedback on are: <br/>1.\tDegree of player control vs. facilitator/rule book.<br/>2.\tHow to keep the set-up phase to a minimum without compromising the very necessary world-burning that needs to take place so that the session has a solid foundation.  <br/>3.\tHow to make life easier for less experienced facilitators.<br/>4.\tHow to make sure that the delicate issue of \u2018mature themes\u2019 and uncomfortable possible subject matter is dealt with. <br/><br/>[After my initial discussion regarding the above I made some changes to the text which I hope have addressed these issues, particularly points 2 and 4]    <br/><br/>5.\tHow issues are resolved and what the characters\u2019 goals shoud be.<br/>6.          Would lists at the back of the book be helpful? Frx names, example family models, personality traits (i.e. one or two-word descriptions like feckless, materialistic, doormat, compulsive liar etc., or short sentences such as 'It's all about the little victories'/ 'Why is it always my fault?'<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Leo                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395553/#Comment_395553" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T06:45:46+00:00" title="October 31, 2012  6:45AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wondering if anyone has any thoughts...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395560/#Comment_395560" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T07:31:38+00:00" title="October 31, 2012  7:31AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think its an intriguing set up and framework to encourage that kind of play. I think my first thought on reading it, actually, was that the real test and fun concept with this game would be to run with a large group(10-15) that regularly split up, fractured and flicked between smaller scenes, almost like a soap opera, with PCs being members of the street, who might also have roles within the community themselves, all of whom are struggling with their own family issues on the side aswell.<br/>In that case, a longer interval, or a post-epilogue might be necessary, to inform everyone of everything that had been going on in the acts in which they were not present.<br/>Another concept that might be interesting to include in your example structures might be that of the related carer and their housemates. With few of the individuals having a direct relation to the child in particular, a very different dynamic might take place that would be interesting to explore (arguably, I would say even more so if they were just 'babysitters' to busy legal guardians on a regular basis).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395607/#Comment_395607" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T13:13:57+00:00" title="October 31, 2012  1:13PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2012 1:47PM by catty_big.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow! James, that's fantastic. Great input, thanks. I really do think this thing has legs, but, as there are almost no candidates for alpha testing in my neck o' t' woods, I intend to develop it entirely through beta, i.e. via these and other forums, cons, local gaming groups etc. In fact, there's a big UK con coming up in a week's time, called Indiecon (yes, the ideal audience!) and I intend to run a few games there to see who bites. I think the best way forward is to run it more or less as is, but drip-feed ideas like yours into it to see how they pan out. One problem I envisage though, is that potentially interested parties will have radically different ideas about how to progress it, hence, as I say, adding new ingredients bit by bit. It might end up being a case of 'Here's the RAW rules, but at the back of the book there's an appendix of different mods/hacks that playtesters have suggested.' Or I could have a wiki linked to my website or whatever. <br/><br/>The way a large group would work best I feel is as a Jeepform table-top larp, where players can actually physically move into and out of the action within a sizeable pre-defined space. At least, I <i>think </i>that's how Jeepforms work, happy to be corrected by the Scandinavians on this forum <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/><br/>James, if you fancy letting your gaming group loose on the game (with or without your mod) please let me know how they get on.<br/><br/>Cheers Leo<br/>P.S. I've just thought of another point on which feedback would be mucho appreciated, and have edited my OP accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397794/#Comment_397794" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T21:19:55+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  9:19PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2012 3:17PM by catty_big.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An absolutely stonking playtest at Indiecon, the UK's premier con and showcase for indie RPGs. It\u2019s amazing how the group builds a family unit, and then roleplays the family as if they really do exist. I think the Interval- where players discuss OOC how the PCs have behaved, casting judgment on them or sympathising, as I say, as if they were people we knew- helps with this.   <br/><br/>In Saturday\u2019s game we had twin brothers, one hippy dippy and the other straitlaced, sharing a house and clashing about how to bring up the children and being messy/tidy etc. Ultimately, after Franklin, 11- natural son of straitlaced family- was dared by Alice, 14- foster daughter of hippy family- to attend a teenage house party (where there was porn being watched and pot and strong alcohol being ingested), which ended up being raided by the police, things came to a head, straitlaced brother's wife announced that she was fed up with everything and the family broke up. <br/><br/>Those two paragraphs hardly do the game justice, but I hope gives folks the flavour of it. It's the sort of game where practically anything can happen. Let's see what sort of family the next group creates.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398116/#Comment_398116" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T15:14:35+00:00" title="November 19, 2012  3:14PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2012 3:16PM by catty_big.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, should have added that after last Saturday's playtest, instead of handing out feedback forms I simply asked the players for suggestions. One lady, who was very enthusiastic about the game in general, thought there should be a Game A, with a set of pre-gens (although I think there'd have to be a lot of them, given the multiplicity of possible family structures) and no player ownership of PCs, and a Game B, with player genned characters but where the players own the characters. <br/> <br/>I personally prefer a mixture, with player genned characters and no ownership (as it is now), although having pre-gens at cons would save an awful lot of time, time being in some ways the enemy as world-building eats into game time considerably. I think Microscope also suffers from this problem, that of the set-up phase chewing up game time. Also, I can see the point of player ownership of PCs in a club setting, especially in a campaign-length game. Thoughts anyone?   <br/> <br/>P.S. <a href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">@James_Fleming</a>: I still think your ideas- of (a) a large group constantly fracturing and re-forming and (b) live-in 'babysitters'- are good ones, and ones which I might attemp to explore after I've had maybe a couple more playtests run off RAW as a 'control'. I'm thinking the large group game would probably work best as either a freeform/jeepform or as a 'private' game run in a chalet at a residential con, taking place over a whole day or even a weekend. I'd have liked to run it at Fastaval next year but I'm launching Sci-Fi Beta Kappa at a con in Edinburgh that weekend. Maybe Fastaval 2014?

Beyond that, it's pretty much just up to the players, right?  Accordingly, my guess is that the right type of help to give players is content.  Basically, springboards to get them started when they're setting a scene or deciding what to inject into a scene next.  Are you familiar with Fiasco's playsets?  They're lists of places and situations (mostly), that you can roll on (or pick from if you like) to get play started quickly.  Where The Heart Is players might find something like that useful.<br/><br/>My experience with this sort of game is that a Wandering Monster can also be a nice option.  That is, at a moment where none of the participants are quite inspired to provide the sort of thing that makes the game work best (stress and angst, for example, seem like required ingredients for the exploration you seem to be going for), they can roll a die or something and get a small injection of content (maybe stress or conflict) into their situation.  Maybe stuff like, "Is that MY shirt you're wearing?", "No, it's YOUR turn to do laundry!", A fire breaks out, A child goes missing, The neighbors get robbed, etc.<br/><br/>Hope this is useful!<br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398179/#Comment_398179" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T07:23:38+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  7:23AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2012 7:28AM by catty_big.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi David<br/><br/>Yes, it's very useful. Thanks! And yes, your summation is broadly correct, and not just in terms of playing the game, but also in terms of its development. As I said in my OP, I'm going straight to public beta with this game since, although I've had a couple of Alpha+ playtests (i.e. with gamers from the UK roleplaying community that I nevertheless didn't know personally) I realised right from the start that I didn't have a hope in Hades of garnering enough Alphas, or even Alpha+ playtesters, for it to evolve as quickly as I'd like (i.e. while I still have all my own teeth).<br/><br/>Also, my intention is for it to develop in a sort of 'open source' way; in other words, although it's my game and I obviously hope to sell copies of the book and make \xa3 out of it, it's the sort of game where non-author content can only aid its development. Hence, I'll try to build in James_Fleming's ideas (see above), and likewise I'll now figure out a way to incorporate yours. From a marketing pov this also means that folks who've contributed very materially in the early stages will have a solid buy-in when the game is published. Naturally, not all ideas will make the final cut, but equally those that do will be credited accordingly. <br/><br/>As to your specific ideas: I really like the concept of a wandering monster. I've heard of this happening in games- well, it's a fairly common mechanic (not to downplay your acuity in spotting its potential application for WtHi)- but I'd never heard it called that. It's a very good mechanic, the only problem I see being that the person introducing it would have to be a GM rather than merely a facilitator. Or do you envisage any player being able to bring it into play, by, say, picking up an index card with 'Why is it always MY fault?' or just 'Dirty laundry' written on it and putting it on the table?<br/><br/>Either way, it's food for thought, dude.

"Wandering Monster" is an old D&amp;D term that I figured a lot of roleplayers might know.  The original idea was that, when the player characters are camping or traveling, you roll to see if a combat finds them, and if so, what creature(s) they'll fight.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, you're right, the responsibility to make the roll was always on the GM, but in WtHi I don't see why it couldn't simply be made by the first person who thinks "a roll would be nice right now".  You could then have either the roller, the whole group, or another player of the roller's choice interpret the roll result (or card draw, whichever) of "Dirty laundry" (etc.) into the fiction.<br/><br/>Just a thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398244/#Comment_398244" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T16:14:03+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  4:14PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2012 4:15PM by catty_big.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh ok. Cool name though, whencever it springeth. Interestingly, I had a conversation with a group of gamer buddies at a con recently where I dropped into the mix the fact that a mad keen GMless gamer that we all knew had suggested to me that every game could be GMless, and that when I said surely not D&amp;D his reply was Yep, that too. <br/><br/>I expected the assembled company to simply laugh, but they took the proposition seriously and came up with the idea of a rotating GM, i.e. each player takes it in turn to wear the hat. Which is interesting because that's what most modern narrative games do: each player in turn frames a scene, and the other players either enter it, or pay a token to be in it or whatever. <br/><br/>I feel that for WtHi to work, though, it has to be genuinely GMless, i.e. the facilitator simply reads out the rules, and then everyone pitches in, either framing secnes or waiting for other players to do so. It sounds bonkers and a recipe for chaos, with everybody talking at once etc., but it really does work. It's like those outwardly barmy traffic schemes where they get rid of pavements and traffic signals etc., or when bands say on their websites 'Pay what you think the album's worth.' Things eventually find their own level, in games as in life, players in co-operative games usually co-operating in a way that on paper one wouldn't think they would.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399566/#Comment_399566" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T12:45:12+00:00" title="December  4, 2012 12:45PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2012 4:02PM by catty_big.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was the third playtest in about three months, and ran very differently from the other two. AP reports for the other games can be found <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=13854" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=14283" rel="nofollow">here</a>). A while back I PM\u2019d Frederik Jensen (author of Montsegur 1244, another game with difficult and uncomfortable topics) to get his thoughts. He responded with the following (edited for relevance to this post):  \n<blockquote> I like the core idea: to explore atypical family constructions. <br/><br/>I think you have a very strong game in there somewhere, so I hope you will accept the challenges I give you with this feedback and come up with a stronger game.<br/><br/>A skilled game master or facilitator can definately create a rich and relevant game experience from the text as currently written. However, I think you are leaving a lot up to the skills of the facilitator. Worse, you risk some groups to fall through and having bad play experiences. <br/><br/>When players agree to play a game, they trust that the game will guide them safely through and that it will lead them to the gold. You should make sure that they spent time on the interesting discussions where they can explore the meat of the theme, not send them on detours! Also, you should span out a safety net underneath them, such that when they fail and fall, they will not get hurt.<br/><br/>Basically, I see two things, that can happen in a group:<br/><br/>1. The group spend 3 hours on setup and character creation. They never get to play more than one or two scenes. They may have a lot of interesting discussions along the way about how their atypical family will look and why. But they will be so engulfed in the setting creation, that they have no creative juice left for playing scenes and exploring the relations through play. <br/><br/>2. A player comes with an inappropriate comment early in the game, e.g. about homosexuality, and none of the other players steps up and raises the lines and veils discussion. The whole game goes down a slapstick path or worse, and one or more of the other players either leaves or are severely offended silently and leaves the games frustrated and hurt.</blockquote>\nNone of the above proved an issue with the first two groups, but I think, with hindsight, this was very likely to do with the fact that the earlier groups either knew each other or were members of a very specific section of the hobby. So while Saturday\u2019s game did run more or less as intended, what Frederik expressed concern about to some extent came to pass. First, character generation ate into precious game time, then the lack of player ownership of characters (not something that Frederik had mentioned but which sort of follows I think from the current set-up) made for a fair amount of chaos, and one or two players said at the end that they struggled to remember what previous players had added to the characters, and so on. In fact, Act 1 (where the adults have their initial scenes) fell a bit flat as a result, also there was some uncertainty about what kinds of topics to introduce.   <br/><br/>Secondly, there was a moment when one of the players asked for time out because of comments made by another player that they felt uncomfortable with. This led to a suggestion that I\u2019ve listed below in the proposed changes section. In the first playtest we decided that a Lines and Veils discussion wasn\u2019t necessary, or rather that nobody had any; in the second I had a discussion at the start, but this proved not to work, indeed the consensus- on these boards and elsewhere- is that it\u2019s not a good idea in general. One of Saturday\u2019s playtesters articulated the problem in this way: if a player flags a topic at the beginning of the game, they\u2019ve as it were \u2018outed\u2019 themselves as someone who\u2019s uncomfortable with that particular topic, whereas if during the game they indicate that they\u2019re uncomfortable with the general direction it\u2019s taking, they can do so without explaining precisely what it is they\u2019re uncomfortable with. Makes sense I think. \xa0<br/><br/>Before I move on to the list of proposed changes, I\u2019ll mention some edited highlights, so as to give an idea of the flavour of the game. Well, I think the outstanding scenes for me were (a) the one where \u2018Midnight\u2019 (real name Claire: 14 yo, goth, rebellious) was putting extensions in Imogen (10 yo, 'girly' girl)\u2019s hair, to the consternation  of one of the adults when it was later discovered. This fed into (b) another stand-out scene, where all three adults (consisting of two gay women who had had two children by IVF and in addition had two foster children, and one bi woman who had two children by different birth fathers from previous relationships) attended a parents\u2019 evening with a teacher from Imogen\u2019s year group. No specific quotes or arguments or tension, I just thought as a scene it worked very well, and I think the players were pleased with the way it went too. Finally (c) a very interesting scene where Adam (artistic, brainy, 9 yo) had to visit his father in prison, which I thought was very moving.<br/><br/>I\u2019ll let the players add more detail to this report if they want to, but I\u2019d like to say one final thing about the game in general. Some of you, if you\u2019ve seen the draft doc, might be thinking that the game is an attempt to be politically correct and it\u2019s got to have mixed ethnicity children, gay or bisexual or transgendered parents and PCs with non-European names etc. Absolutely not. The family can be completely majority ethnic; the characters can all be of traditional sexuality; you can have male characters going out to work and female characters staying at home doing the cooking and looking after the children, etc. It\u2019s entirely up to the individual player group as to what kind of family model they create, and with what kinds of characters they populate the household. It\u2019s also up to the players whether or not they incorporate the ideas below (which will eventually however work their way into the default rules) or totally freeform it; it\u2019s my intention that the game will be flexible enough to cope with any issues arising through play, and cater for a wide variety of playstyles. Ok so, suggested changes:     <br/><br/>1.\tPlayer ownership of PCs.<br/>2.\tA way of speeding up character generation for convention games, probably with a 'palette' of categories such as family models, personality adjectives, lists of names and jobs, suggestions for back stories etc, rather than dozens of pre-gens.<br/>3.\tA better way of flagging uncomfortable topics, possibly via a traffic light system. <br/>4.\tA system of 'wandering monster' cards, probably two types, one being narrative hooks (laundry rota, homework, a used condom) the other crisis/event cards (power cut, knock at the door, telephone call).<br/>5.\tTweak the generator die to reduce the number of children, or make the number proportional to the number of adults.<br/>6.\tBetter establishment of inter-character relationships and dynamics. <br/>7.\tThe facilitator perhaps having more of a co-ordinating role, and playing lead NPCs like teachers and social workers etc.<br/><br/>As always, comments welcome  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405701/#Comment_405701" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-07T18:13:28+00:00" title="February  7, 2013  6:13PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2013 6:28PM by catty_big.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, have done some work since the last playtest, specifically attempting to address the points raised during that game, as follows:<br/><br/>1.\tPlayer ownership of PCs. <i>Done (but have made non-ownership optional and the suggested preference for time-limited con games).</i><br/><br/>2.\tA way of speeding up character generation for convention games, probably with a 'palette' of categories such as family models, personality adjectives, lists of names and jobs, suggestions for back stories etc, rather than dozens of pre-gens. <i>Done (see character palette)</i>.<br/><br/>3.\tA better way of flagging uncomfortable topics, possibly via a traffic light system. <i>Currently dealt with by having made clear in the rules that if any player is uncomfortable they can call time out without having to explain what they\u2019re uncomfortable with. Also, if facilitator feels that a player is \u2018metagaming\u2019 (bringing their personal issues into the game) they should deal with this swiftly and firmly</i>.  <br/><br/>4.\tA system of 'wandering monster' cards, probably two types, one being narrative hooks (laundry rota, homework, a used condom) the other crisis/event cards (power cut, knock at the door, telephone call). <i>Done (see pp 8 &amp; 15), but how to introduce them? Three solutions offered (see section on topic cards on p8)</i>.<br/><br/>5.\tTweak the generator die to reduce the number of children, or make the number proportional to the number of adults. <i>I\u2019m keen to retain this mechanic, as it\u2019s in keeping with the overall randomness of the game\u2019s theme. Needs more playtesting</i>.<br/><br/>6.\tBetter establishment of inter-character relationships and dynamics. <i>Done (see p5)</i>.<br/><br/>7.\tThe facilitator perhaps having more of a co-ordinating role, and playing lead NPCs like teachers and social workers etc. <i>More playtesting needed for this one.

If however you think Act 3 is useful, can you say why? What purpose does it serve?<br/>2.\tI\u2019m considering putting together a number of playsets (scenarios?) with pre-genned characters, a theme, external situation/threat and setting (near future, WWII, far future  etc.). Would you find this useful, or would you prefer the players to co-operatively make up their own family and goals etc.? I\u2019m primarily thinking time-strapped convention play/demo games here. <br/>3.\tShould the game be GM\u2019d or GMless? <br/>4.\tWhat do you think of the topic cards (p10 &amp; 17)? Would you find them useful? How would you use them?<br/><br/>As usual, all comments gratefully received.     <br/><br/>Thanks <br/>Leo                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
