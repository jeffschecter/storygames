So, if your character is hit, you get to choose where and how. It's only used as a last resource option and once it's full, the next injurie kills the character.<br/><br/>But what happens in social conflicts? You can't break a leg trying to convince someone of something (unless things go very, very wrong) But people can start distrusting you, call you a liar, murder, thief, etc. So I'm trying to make a list of "social injuries". Or better yet, hack one from a game that uses a similar idea. Have you ever heard of a game like this? Did it worked?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386003/#Comment_386003" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T19:58:31+00:00" title="July 30, 2012  7:58PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. No, I haven't seen that used exactly like that although if memory serves it's kind of how Technoir works. It's an interesting approach.<br/><br/>I use story points in <a href="http://www.steampunkfitters.com/" rel="nofollow">Steampunkfitters</a> to measure the relative "importance" of a character to the story. Socially injure them and it's just as bad as stabbing them with a sword.<br/><br/>In <a href="http://www.theartifact.net/" rel="nofollow">The Artifact</a> (in the 3rd ed rules anyway) I use stress points to model how much social pressure the character is feeling.<br/><br/>So what would a social injury be and how would you make it stick? I might make someone seem "unreliable" but how do you get the PC to start treating another PC that way? I like it, but without numbers the best I can imagine is something similar to "tired" "hurt" "bleeding" "dying". So "frustrated" "upset" "angry" "embarrassed"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386004/#Comment_386004" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T20:14:49+00:00" title="July 30, 2012  8:14PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if you had a stack of physical (red) chips and social (blue) chips.  When you take an injury, physical or social, you or the GM says why it hurts and you move one chip of the appropriate color forward.  If you every move all your red or blue chips forward, you're basically out of the game.  The catch is that whenever you say something you want to do, the GM can use one of the pushed forward red chips and say, "that's what you tried to do but you couldn't because it hurt too much - what did you do that didn't hurt so much?"  If you narrate something social or say something in character, the GM can use one of the pushed forward blue chips and say, "that's what you wanted to say but it didn't come out that way - what did you really say?"  This way you narrate the injury but the GM can decide when past injuries come back to haunt you.  Injuries make you do suboptimal or second best things in the fiction but don't shut you down.  You can be hurt the same way, or not, but you don't have to track specific wounds.  It's different than injury lists, I know, but that's what jumped into my head after reading your post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386006/#Comment_386006" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T21:11:18+00:00" title="July 30, 2012  9:11PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a few games where social conflict can have lasting effects similar to injuries.<br/><br/>As Onix pointed out, <i>Technoir</i> does something like this, where you assign some kind of negative tag against your opponent, whether physical injury or mental stress or social embarassment.

You then get people frustrated about being forced to do something (because, yes, such a conflict is beating the target's character on the head - with words - until they agree to what the initiator wants).<br/><br/>I would be interested in a different social mechanic: one in which you have to earn someone's trust. Perhaps the target could first rate how important the issue is for them (say, from 1 to 5) and list this many "checkpoints". Each checkpoint might be assigned a task, perhaps from a ready-made list (something like: "prove you're reliable: do this task in time" =&gt; buy me a dress for today's ball; or "prove you're trustworthy: keep this secret" =&gt; deliver this letter without opening it). Then, after all (or most) of the tasks are fulfilled, the initiator achieves their goal because target feels they've earned it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386026/#Comment_386026" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T05:15:13+00:00" title="July 31, 2012  5:15AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But back to the OP: aren't social injuries easier to define in context, as a soured relationship with a specific individual or group?

If someone likes you already you don't have to do much to convince them of something. But to your point, what if you wanted them to like you more? You would carry out tasks for them, get them gifts or if you're Ben Franklin you ask them to borrow a rare book.<br/><br/>What does this do to the person? They start to feel pressure to upgrade your status with them. If they agree, then you start dating or become best friends or whatever the desired outcome was. If they don't want to, even if you're being nice to them, they start to feel stress because you're putting pressure on them. It's the ultimate outcome that the person being pressured has to accept or reject and a PC should always have that option. However if they reject you, there are lasting hard feelings and the stress doesn't go away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386029/#Comment_386029" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T06:00:56+00:00" title="July 31, 2012  6:00AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Truth &amp; Justice, a superhero <a href="http://evilhat.wikidot.com/pdq" rel="nofollow">PDQ</a> game, has this kind of thing.

Wooooo, I love that game. ^__-<br/><br/>3Jane, I think some re-alignment of assumptions could be needed. First, the OP asked about social injuries, and you're assuming those result from a social "combat", but that's not a given; depending on the game (pre-release versions of <i>On Mighty Thews</i>, or PDQ like Steve said, or <i>Mouse Guard</i>\u2026) "social damage" may result from failing at a purely physical task (you get beat up, for example, but the bruises from it are minor and are not what sticks; the loss of street cred, confidence, or the poor show you made in front of other people is what sticks).<br/>OTOH, I tend to assume that if a game includes combat-like social interaction mechanics (most games by Vincent Baker, for example, including Dogs, IaWA and AW) it's because the designer <i>wants</i> social interactions to be fighty - as a feature of the setting, the game's premise, etc. If it was a game about coming to peaceful agreements, the system would be built for that - hopefully. But this may be straying away from the topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386043/#Comment_386043" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T09:31:36+00:00" title="July 31, 2012  9:31AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great input everybody, many thanks! Ok, The game I'm designing uses 3 different resources to assimilate damage, player can choose on any of then at their own risk:<br/>-"Luck points" A pool of tokens that can assimilate both phisical and social damage, since it's more a representation of "plot armor". These can also be spent to roll one more dice and keep the best or traded for other resources / level up current resources / heal injuries in rest scenes.<br/>-Conditions, one of the variables in the deck used in the game. Right now the deck has only physical conditions, that may impose a -1 on the roll up to three conditions. When the player accumulates 3 conditions and fails the next roll, she gets 3 injuries, but all conditions dissapear.<br/>-Injuries, a limited list that each player checks on their character sheet. Ranging from scars and loose theet to blindness and amputation. The list is just 12 items long and the idea is that it doesn't leave the character unplayable, at least for the fiction. However each injury may affect the level of the next challenge. The more hurt you are, the harder it becomes to beat the next monster; but not in terms of higher difficulty, it's more like it's gonna take you longer.<br/><br/>So all I need now is to improve the... well, yes, it's a sort of social combat. However I don't intend it to be something like "you win now I love you" but more like "My reputation has gone to the ground, so I better give up...for now" or "I'm gotta scale it to a fight... even though I gain the Short-tempered reputation"<br/><br/>Hmm...

It's mostly brainstorming, but you might see something of interest. I'm working on a hack for World of Dungeons that includes "social attacks" during Arguments.<br/><br/>An Argument occurs whenever people start yelling at each other, insulting each other, debating with each other, or whatever, and there are significant people around to witness it or there are some serious stakes involved. Anything less in a social sense is equivilent to pushing and shoving. A true Argument is more like social hack and slash. The participants are making vicious and meaningful verbal attacks towards one another and someone's reputation is on the line.<br/><br/>Scrutiny is a measure of how well a character can stand up to social pressures in an Argument. It is to social what Wounds are to physical. You roll 2d6+Cunning to make a social attack and do 1d6+Cunning Scrutiny damage. When your scrutiny is depleted, you immediately take a Stigma and further scrutiny damage results in exacerbating that Stigma. The Stigma is a semi-permenant flaw in your character's reputation or social status within a group of people significant to your character.<br/><br/><i>Thadius Brent is locked in a verbal duel with another Highblood infront of a crowded ball room. The opposing noble, Bringer Stoneman, insulted his mother in such a nasty way. Brent decides to go on the offense and try to embarress the noble infront of the crowd. Brent rolls+Cunning. He gets a 4 and 3, +2 for his Cunning, so a 9. He runs into a Problem, and the GM decides to Exchange Scrutiny. Before Brent can pull off his insult, Stoneman lands another verbal blow against Brent's mother's purity, but Brent returns with a jab of his own by shedding light on Stoneman's own infedilities. Brent rolls 1d6+2 for his attack, rolling a 2 and adding the bonus. The GM rolls for Stoneman's attack and gets a total of 7. The GM had noted earlier that Stoneman's Scrutiny was 4, so Brent's insult destroys Stoneman's reputation infront of the crowd and he takes a Stigma. However, Brent only had 7 Scrutiny points which leaves Brent with a Stigma of his own. The GM decides the crowd reacts badly to their argument and kicks them both out of the ball.<br/><br/>Brent earns the Stigma: Instigator (the Highblood see you as a troublemaker - you're no longer invited to the ball) </i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386117/#Comment_386117" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-01T01:21:52+00:00" title="August  1, 2012  1:21AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>3Jane, I think some re-alignment of assumptions could be needed.

In your first example, you have a situation where someone is completing tasks that someone else is requesting of them but that is a narrow situation that would only happen with an employer and employee and possibly someone in great need. That by itself could be really useful for a game, don't get me wrong. I don't see that as something you would do to someone that's a friend or a romantic interest. It's more likely that in that situation you'd take up doing kindnesses on your own and then the other person would either decide they like it or don't like it.

I don't have any better ideas than reputation (social injuries) and/or the feeling of stress (emotional/mental injuries). However, reputation would probably be injured in conflicts such as Duel of Wits, which was originally described as something performed for the audience (people listening in whose opinion of the losing character changes). Not sure how to describe internal damage, or damage done to a relationship between two characters... stress relates to that, but also maybe relationship points, something like in Smallville? (Use your influence over this guy to get him to do X, but you also challenge your relationship in the process).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Onix">@Onix</a> well actually when I was writing the example I _was_ thinking of a romantic interest, in this case courtly romance and intrigue ala Dumas.

These variables could be:<br/>-trustfullness: the character is considered trustworthy or a traitor, depending if the gauge goes to - or +. <br/>-bravery: the character is considered courageous or coward<br/>-temper: the character is considered temperamental or calm<br/><br/>uh... well I still haven't got any idea what the other two could be, but the idea is that each social conflict, argument or even actions in battle can affect one variable gauge by one, up or down (again, the player gets to choose how his character assimilates damage). And though it represents how the character is perceived, it doesn't mean that's how the character is or that all PCs or NPCs will react in the same way to the character.<br/><br/>Now, that's for social injuries, but for social combat I agree that rolling to convince someone of something, though simple and useful enough, isn't an accurate representation of how we manage ourselves insocial conflicts and on top it creates the feeling that the character is being controlled instead of actually convinced. Which is quite unconfortable among players. It's not the focus of the game I'm working on, so I'll just probably have to keep it to one roll and deal with the consequences, unless there's an easier way to deal with this in a more fair way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386157/#Comment_386157" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-01T14:12:07+00:00" title="August  1, 2012  2:12PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <b>Monsterhearts</b>, people gain Conditions, which can represent physical circumstances (drenched in pig's blood, barefoot, bleeding, etc) or social stigmas/judgments (unwelcome, slut, basketcase, etc).

Otherwise, the game outweights the story and though it has it's own fun, in the end it becomes too mechanical and meta, going further and further from the style of play I like playing.<br/><br/>Edit: on second thought, you can't just totally eliminate the good tension a dice roll creates. However, if the player get's really creative I see no reason why facing a challenges can't be reduced to a really good speech and one dice roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386314/#Comment_386314" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-03T11:55:35+00:00" title="August  3, 2012 11:55AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could set up social injuries a little like Conditions in Mouse Guard, too, where each escalation introduces some new problem and you have to recover them in order. Stuff like "disliked," "discredited," "untrustworthy," "reviled."

I'd say you can spent "luck points" to avoid such reaction but you'll earn more points if you succeed while acting under such conditions. You could even revert those conditions on a critical success!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gullerbutry" title="Gullerbutry"><img alt="Gullerbutry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gullerbutry">Gullerbutry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386353/#Comment_386353" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-04T06:10:03+00:00" title="August  4, 2012  6:10AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're looking for two more conditions to complete your list of trust/bravery/temper, how about:<br/>station: how well people feel you mix with society, how presentable you are<br/>clout: how much people fear your influence - lose it, and people say, "Oh, he's harmless."<br/><br/>As a side note, I like how the Fate system works in play for this sort of thing; four Consequence "slots" of increasing importance that can be filled with free-form tags like "nobody trusts him," "embarassed," "wanted for murder," etc. A PC in my game punched an NPC at a party, dealing the social  Consequence "jaw wired shut" - which definitely affected his social rolls for a while. A Consequence can be removed after waiting a certain amount of time and (in my game, anyway), playing a scene and making a roll.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
