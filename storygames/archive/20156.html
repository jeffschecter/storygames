Because those are pretty cool.</blockquote>\nIt's sometimes good to remember that real outer space is filled with light, even if most of it isn't visible light. Which is why I enjoy the effect of making that radiation visible in space photography and art. In the Sea of Black Stars the space is filled with diffuse illumination, but there are nebula, storms, and stranger things:<br/><br/><b>2) Environment Encounter - ( d20, d20+4 within a Nebula, or d12+8 within a Stillness ) </b><br/>1-3 <i>Nebula</i> - a cloud of roiling, tinted energy, often aligned - roll for its Nebula Hue (2.1). <br/>4-5 <i>Stillness</i>s - an eery region where standard propulsion fails - roll for its Stillness (2.2). <br/>6 <i>Maelstrom</i> - a vortex of detritus spiraling around some occluded center (2.3). <br/>7 <i>Tessellation</i> - a place where the very substance of the Sea is shattered, leaving spatial and temporal distortions (2.4) and oozing strange energies (2.5).<br/>8 <i>Beacon</i> - a natural or artificial object which acts as a focal point in the beacon network. It is connected with d8 other beacons, and has a distinct Hue (2.1) from its neighbors, implying some relationship with Nebula Hues, although they need not match a Nebula they are found in.<br/>9 <i>Black Star</i> - a huge object slowly absorbing the ambient light and energy of the Sea. These behemoths give birth to new worlds and gateways over massive time scales, are occasionally inhabited - although their constant drain takes its toll on those who spend too long in their presence.<br/>10-13 <i>Fragment</i> - roll for Material (D.5.3) and for Habitation (2.6)<br/>14-15 <i>Single World</i> - see (D), but it will be contained in the Sea of Black Stars.<br/>16 System of worlds, orbiting around something. Roll 2d8 to determine the number and roll on (2.3) to determine its center. See (D) for individual worlds, which will be contained in the Sea.<br/>17-19 <i>Gateway</i> - opening to another place, roll for metaplane (D 5.1) and if you roll Sea of Black Stars instead roll for a world (D) not contained within the Sea itself (at least here).<br/>20 <i>A Dynamic Event frozen in place</i> - roll d12+5 for the event (3)<br/>21 <i>Phantasmal World</i> - a world in this Nebula which exists only as a phantasm to those who have physical form. This world is related to the Nebula\u2019s Hue. Create using (D), but skip the Cosmology step.<br/>22 <i>Reef</i> - a solidification of the Nebula resembling a Material (D 5.3) and roll for Habitation (2.6).<br/>23 <i>Fragment Swarm</i> - a world that has broken into fragments, roll on (D 5.3) for its materials and roll for Habitation (2.6).<br/>24 <i>Bright Star</i> - like a black star but glowing and emitting the hue of its Nebula.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
