Camp Nerdly was awesome this year.<br/><br/>We had a bunch of new people, but not so many that the culture of camp nerdly was overwhelmed.  Which was awesome.  It was great to meet new people, or game with people who had been around a while but I had never gamed with.<br/><br/>The food this year was awesome.  Sure I didn't have bacon every morning, but I didn't care at all.  The food was good. The food went out with less effort than usual. The food got cleaned up with less effort than usual.  I got to game through lunch. No one got stuck out of a game or had limited game choices because of a chore (at least it seemed that way).  This was a real improvement.<br/><br/>The pitch worked great.  It wasn't like there was a shortage of games, and it really seemed to help the newer people get involved.  I hope people were not too dissapointed by not getting players.  My Trouble With Demons game sadly fell short of the required number to play, but I'm not bothered by that.  One of my bigger regrets was that my Monsterhearts game filled up before there was a chance to do a pitch, and I know at least one person was disappointed by that.<br/><br/>Several of us had a discussion and thought of one possible improvement for next year, doing a friday night welcome.  The idea is to make an active effort to get people gaming with people they haven't played with before on friday night.  Largely as a way of trying to reach out to the new people.  Not sure how much it would help, I was happy to see at least the new people I met getting sucked into plenty of games.<br/><br/>I ran a game and played in games.  I made new friends.  Camp Nerdly rocks.  Thanks guys.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379081/#Comment_379081" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-21T04:46:53+00:00" title="May 21, 2012  4:46AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Big thanks to:<br/><br/>Remi, for organizing the event and handling the nontrivial NPS bureaucracy, and successfully delegating.<br/><br/>Mark Causey and Davey Cruz, for selflessly jumping in and doing some nasty but critical chores.<br/><br/>Jule Ann, for organizing the kitchen with zeal and professionalism and deliciousness.

So with Josh and Budda, we head off, and Patty totally brings it!  Her Kagematsu was amnesiac at first, stumbling down the mountain, a man of means but not of clear purpose.  Josh was an older (40s) woman, owner of a now run-down bath house.  High Charm (6) only one Innocence.  Buddah played a women in her twenties with familial responsibility.  Younger brother plus an inn to try to maintain.  He was 5 Charm, 2 Innocence.  I was tempted to throw in with high Innocence low Charm, but it seems to me the middle road would be a better counter-example.  So I did 4 Innocence, 3 Charm.  She was stuck, not having yet been given an adult name (as her father is presumed dead) but trying to leave the world of children.<br/><br/>Our strategies could not have been more different, and it really added depth to the game.  Josh and Budda both had scenes where they easily snared two Affections, and then got hooked on the third, having to get Desperate, and the tension on those dice rolls was awesome.  I have an audio recording of the entire session, but I haven't transcribed it yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The Mountain Witch:  Near 10 people showed, but we filtered down to 6.  We had some really killer scenes, but I still struggle with how much to talk about game mechanics before we get started.  So we spent nearly an hour on the first "scene" and half the game in the first "chapter."  It was paced deliciously... players getting first used to the mechanic, then to one another's characters, then feeling out how to foreshadow and flirt with the fate, then commanding their fates.<br/><br/>My regret here is that some players were ready and looking to crash their fates in to one another's, but some players hadn't really decided what their fate meant yet.  If we had two more hours...<br/>BUT Oh My God!  They stole narration from one another so frequently.  It was amazing and I thank you all for that game.  I've never seen people engage that aspect as much, and I'm grateful that you all did.   One really epic scene that I was proud of was:<br/><br/>Four of the ronin gathered on the edge of a long bridge to the castle.  One of the Nio halted them and said that in order to pass, they must leave that which they value most.  (Flagrantly stolen idea that I've been a little fearful to work in, because mechanically, the players can EASILY mash dice together and unmake that obstacle.)  So Dave does just that.  He steps up to the Nio and focuses his Ability to terrorize the spirit with a vision of his own death.  (This means he strides towards him with his blade drawn, because the vision comes from the reflection in the blade.) Of course, he has to roll, and the Nio gets to set counter-stake.  I say "He wishes to take your sword from you."  Two players literally gasped at that.  "Dave no!"  But he did... and the dice... they didn't go in Dave's favor.<br/><br/>So the Nio called to Dave's sword and it lept into the Nio's hand.  The Nio rammed it downward into the offering bowl.  "O-yanma has accepted your soul.  You may pass."  Intensity.  And Dave has a talent for giving the "WTF did you just do to my character?!?" face.<br/><br/>So then Willam jumps up and says he'll duel the Nio, to prove his worth.  He's trying to assert that he doesn't need to pay any price now, because his intentions grant him some special exemption.  (The wording was more poetic, but I didn't get an audio recording, so I don't remember the exact details.)  The important thing was he wagers his life.  The Nio cautions "Know this, oh man of the waves, I will not end your life if I win, I will spend it as I see fit."  The duel... it does not go in William's favor.  The Nio takes William's life, and pledges it gladly to the offering bowl.  "You will serve O-Yanma well.  You may pass."<br/><br/>So then the remaining two ronin didn't want to roll dice at all.  They volunteered burdens into the offering bowl.  The last to cross placed his identity into the bowl, forgetting everything but his purpose.  INTENSE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Puppetland: Had three of four returning characters.  As mentioned elsewhere, I was trying to drive it to a place of darkness, and highlight that element, that naivete that Judy's purpose represents.  So that when the puppets were confronted by adult ideas, they had the burden of explaining them away, or denying them.  And I mean, mechanically, I would reach across and black out their characters unless they could fight of flee from the idea.  Which was fantastically hard to do when we can't talk about what we are doing!  We have to stay in character, at all times, but they got it.  Somehow they understood that the ideas themselves were poison, the concept of suicide, the permanence of death, the fear that any puppet could be un-made.  They stepped it up and swallowed that chunk of blackness, despite interruptions to the game and having to cut things short.  (An hour is not Golden all the time.)<br/><br/>And while we did have some really great scenes, all of which are recorded, the highlight for me is still the children next to us saying "No... keep playing." when we needed to pack up and stop.<br/><br/>Thank you all for not breaking character, even when we're all dealing with the extra, out of game struggle to keep our hour of time.  You were each of you amazing.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379119/#Comment_379119" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-21T08:10:56+00:00" title="May 21, 2012  8:10AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you sincerely to everyone who organized the event, and I mean everyone.

Basically a Norwegian prince shows up and demands hospitality and messes things up. This session was interesting because we had a very aggressive Skjaldmey and a weak Go\xf0i. The Skjaldmey took his place in a Holmganga duel of honor, killing the second of Lambi Tonbrekka, the Norwegian asshat, in one blow. This happened to be Dave Younce's character, The Wanderer, which was pretty fun. There was a cool and tragic subplot with the Go\xf0i's wife (initially an NPC, but later a well-realized character played by someone who started the game "just watching") Fenja. She grew to hate her husband and converted to Christianity with the aid of Lambi and the "Five Christian Brothers" he traveled with. There was a fight on his longship, Fenja was struck down by Lambi (as the Sei\xf0kona had prophesied early in the game) and the Skjaldmey and her brother the Huscarl threw down with the Five Brothers, killing four of them and sealing the fate of the Go\xf0iship of Digranes. The Norwegian king had been offended, his men slaughtered. The future looked bleak. High five!<br/><br/>The game went well, although there were some spotlight issues. I felt like the Sei\xf0kona and the Huscarl didn't have as much meat as the others, and I regretted letting the Skjaldmey defy her husband so easily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379128/#Comment_379128" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-21T10:15:37+00:00" title="May 21, 2012 10:15AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Sagas of the Icelanders</b> [2]<br/><br/>I played the Skjaldmey, and I agree with Jason's assessment that I got away from my husband without enough trouble. <br/>But there were two factors that made this happen:<br/>1- the skjaldmey lived in a different town from where the action was going to happen<br/>2- fighting with her husband, sans any other PCs present, would not have been super-exciting<br/><br/>At the end, I kept the lone surviving Christian Brother as a thrall, for a gift to my husband. <br/><br/>I wish we could have seen more of the Seidkona too!

I actually would have liked to have one more day.  Highlights for me were playing a never-accused spy in <i>Resistance</i>, finding out I'm not nearly as bad at Frisbee as I used to be (although I'm no Dave Berg), and getting to play Sagas of the Icelanders.  Speaking of which...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/><b>Sagas of the Icelanders.</b> The game went well, although there were some spotlight issues.

I do wish I we hadn't stopped when we did, however, because I feel like there was some juicy stuff about to happen between the Go\xf0i and myself.  I'm picturing our conflict simmering, him kicking me out and me heading off to live with my sister the Skjaldmey.  Of course, I've still got something to prove so I end up killing the Go\xf0i of my sister's village (AKA her husband) and marrying her to consolidate power.  Oh, sure, my quarrel was with my own Go\xf0i, but rather than killing him, how much more delicious would it be to have him watch as I helm my own settlement and raise it to greater prominence and glory than his?  Have I thought about this too much?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><br/>My playtest of<i>Within My Clutches</i>was extremely fun, and I think I know the few remaining changes I need to make it one-shot-compliant.

One thing I particularly enjoyed that I was wondering if you could codify is how elements of each of our stories popped up as background in the other villains' stories, like when King Orzomon was there when Captain Metropolis showed up to give Coldblood the Nobel Peace Prize.  I think it would keep the game from being four unrelated stories.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Another huge highlight: a 10-person all-ages ring of frisbee-tossing with 2 monkeys in the middle.

I was pretty bummed out, especially since I thought the idea of pitching was that games wouldn't get people penciled in until they were pitched.  In fact, overall, I think the pitching aspect was the worst part of Nerdly for me.  I much prefer to know what I am doing and at what time rather than have stuff pop up willy nilly.  I had a game I wanted to run, but I never knew if I wanted to pitch it until I knew what else was going on in any given slot, and by then it was too late for pitching.  <br/><br/>I think this is just a personal preference thing, however, and I don't have any other Nerdlies to compare it to.  People who have been to more than one seem to think that this was a better way than the previous method, so there's that.<br/><br/>Anyway, my scheduling gripe notwithstanding, I had a lovely time and met some awesome folks.

Basically a Norwegian prince shows up and demands hospitality and messes things up. This session was interesting because we had a very aggressive Skjaldmey and a weak Go\xf0i. The Skjaldmey took his place in a Holmganga duel of honor, killing the second of Lambi Tonbrekka, the Norwegian asshat, in one blow. This happened to be Dave Younce's character, The Wanderer, which was pretty fun. There was a cool and tragic subplot with the Go\xf0i's wife (initially an NPC, but later a well-realized character played by someone who started the game "just watching") Fenja. She grew to hate her husband and converted to Christianity with the aid of Lambi and the "Five Christian Brothers" he traveled with. There was a fight on his longship, Fenja was struck down by Lambi (as the Sei\xf0kona had prophesied early in the game) and the Skjaldmey and her brother the Huscarl threw down with the Five Brothers, killing four of them and sealing the fate of the Go\xf0iship of Digranes. The Norwegian king had been offended, his men slaughtered. The future looked bleak. High five!<br><br>The game went well, although there were some spotlight issues.

One of the reasons Nerdly ran so smoothly was that people were good and cheerful about doing their chores and other little jobs they picked up along the way. Overall people seemed happy, and the best moments for me were spent in the Dining Hall, listening to the cheerful sound of games going wonderfully.<br/><br/>I played in Rachel's Friday-night Burning Wheel game, where we played shipwrecked thieves. It was good, and exposed me a good deal to the inner workings of The Wheel.<br/><br/>I played in two games with Bill White. The first was a playground game he brought, which involved English Treasure, battle cries and shuttlecocks standing in for arrows. The second was a game of The Prince's Kingdom which started out with many princesses, but ended up with only two princes trying to figure out why an island was revolting against the King.<br/><br/>I also ran my Cthulhu Dark space station scenario 'Everest'. It went swimmingly badly for the space maitenance crew that had to stand up to a terrifying menace that influenced their very minds.<br/><br/>I got to play in both of Jason's LARPS, the Tribunal and The Climb. The Climb was an absolute highlight of my Nerdly gaming. Shouting at Buddha that being a leader meant taking responsibility for people dying was super fun, as was coming to detente with Jeff Wills, playing a man my character had left to die on an earlier expedition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379179/#Comment_379179" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-21T16:32:22+00:00" title="May 21, 2012  4:32PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BlazmoIntoWowee</cite>Have I thought about this too much?</blockquote>\nI have to think that a brother and sister marrying would <i>tempt fate</i>. <br/><br/>I think Halla would have to change her opinion of Magni quite a bit in order to go to war with him.

Oh, plus ticks.<br/><br/><b>Games Played:</b> Archipelago, 13th Age, Dungeon Squad, Lamentations of the Flame Princess, Monsterhearts                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379206/#Comment_379206" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-21T20:19:57+00:00" title="May 21, 2012  8:19PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2012 8:31PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BlazmoIntoWowee</cite>That was definitely fun.  One thing I particularly enjoyed that I was wondering if you could codify is how elements of each of our stories popped up as background in the other villains' stories, like when King Orzomon was there when Captain Metropolis showed up to give Coldblood the Nobel Peace Prize.  I think it would keep the game from being four unrelated stories.</blockquote>This is one of the facets of the game I waffle on.
