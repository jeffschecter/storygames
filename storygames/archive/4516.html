Mike Holmes can certainly correct me here but IME if you add any of the "I'm in control / it's up to me whether to resist your conflict" then players won't be in the same creative space - they'll be looking for the DM-style player to be providing the conflict (or worse, looking to him and trying to jive with his ideas above others) and that means less of the cool stone soup effect that you see when everybody is responsible for making the game fun in the same way. <br/><br/>Rob "Valvorik" Harper used Universalis to build his next campaign world with his players, and he did it mostly by just sticking to Universalis as-is.  I know a few others have tried this as well but I think the god-game part would give it more personality and breadth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102412/#Comment_102412" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T07:09:17+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  7:09AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree.

I'm more talking about just unilaterally deciding to be more aggressive and confrontational in playing the "god game" you designed that flopped.

There are rules for resolving conflicts but nothing that provides conflict in and of itself.<br/><br/>I was reading through Mortal Coil today and I saw Passions, and I thought... here we go.  In fact, if I did a Universalisoid god game I'd be looking for passions like Mortal Coil as the key defining characteristic of a deity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102628/#Comment_102628" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T05:46:38+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  5:46AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a side note, in the demo I played of Mortal Coil, you play gods.

Universalis fits the bill I think, but I can think of two other house rules that I'd want:<br/><br/>At least one of a god's passions should be "worthy of a god" - that is to say, it's important that Zeus isn't just trying to bang princesses - it's important that fearing change is part of it as well (or loving the divine order, or hating the primordial, fearing prophecy, etc.)  So I'd think that there would have to be a "philosophical" passion built into the gods.<br/><br/>The other idea is using Theme from Mortal Coil as well.  The gods essentially write the "theme statements" in the world, and these could be brought into the conflicts as well.  Such as "Evil eats at itself."  "Innocence is blind to evil." and so forth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
