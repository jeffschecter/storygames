It is an open secret that the Patent Office is run by the Transcendental AIs, whose very beings are spread across time itself. The Transcendentals desire the survival of humanity - as much of it as possible - into the distant future, in order to ease their loneliness. Towards this end, they have hired you, so that you might save humanity.<br/><br/>S.A. characters are rated on both a character level (their experiences and the technologies built into their bodies) and on a story level (what sorts of events they tend to be embroiled in). <br/><br/>A demo, some game logs, forums, and plenty of information about the game can be found at <a href="http://suffadv.wikidot.com" rel="nofollow">our wiki</a>.<br/><br/>Links to purchase:<br/><br/>PDF at <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=51719" rel="nofollow">RPGNow</a><br/>PDF at <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=51719" rel="nofollow">DriveThruRPG</a><br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1339784" rel="nofollow">Hardcover at Lulu</a><br/><br/>Pricing: $20 for PDF, $60 for hardcover.

(Quoting myself quoting... myself. How recursive...)\n<blockquote>Ok, first, a quote of myself from the Culture thread, to give thisa bit of background:\n<blockquote><br/>Ok, a bit more, there's a whole bunch of systems out there that should be able to do a Culture game without too much of a problem. Personally, I would go with something that scales well, had either a unified conflict resolution system or some sort of social combat mechanic, and was abstract enough to handle various technologies without breaking or having to do lots of conversion and worldbuilding work.<br/><br/>So in my case, I'd probably use Sufficiently Advanced, because it fits the above and is even designed with this kinds of setting in mind and things like Core Values (A characters, well, central moral/ideological values, which generally come partly from his civiliation in SA, have many effects, like giving bonuses in situations that fit them or being central in conflicts of "brainwashing", memetic warfare or mind control.) and the assumption of technology in the characters seem to fit very well.<br/><br/>Characters in SA consist of three big parts: Core Values, Themes and Stats. Core Values I described above, Themes describe what kind of story influence the characters have and allow dramatic editing. Like, the James Bond type character would have themes like Romance, Plot Immunity and Magnetism. Stats are, well, skills which tend to be broad, more occupations or jobs then anything else, and the Stats itself. The nice tweak: Stats aren't stuff like "Strength", they are the various Technologies that make up the future. Stringtech for energy creation and manipulation, Nanotech for sensors and perception and so on. So the characters are descibed by:<br/><br/>-Their personal ideals and values (Core Values)<br/>-Their role in and influence on the plot (Themes)<br/>-Their Experience and Knowledge (Skills)<br/>-The Technology at their disposal (Stats)<br/><br/>Which fits quite nicely with something like the Culture, IMO. Especially with the interesting twist that players can choose their stats pretty freely, but the higher their stats, the lower their plot iportance and thus their Themes. Which means they have a harder time using them to influence the story, while that boring, backwards Old Worlder who wouldn't stand a snowballs chance in hell in a high tech nanowar can still contribute because he can influence the story much more directly and it will cost him less to do so.</blockquote>\nNow, the basics:<br/><br/>Sufficiently Advanced is a Far Future SciFi games that will come out in January (For Genericon, IIRC.), written by Colin Fredericks, and will also be available for PoD from lulu, probably both in hard and softcover.<br/><br/>I only read a playtest document, so some of what I'm saying here may well turn out to be wrong or different in the final version.<br/><br/>Generally, SA is set in the really far future and tries to adress a part of the SciFi genre you don't see very often, namely the sorta-transhumanist, sorta post-scarcity humanity-has-split-into-different-civilisations type SciFi seen in the stories of authors like Frank Herbert (sorta), Charles Stross or Dan Simmons.<br/><br/>The setup is basically this: With the help of Transcedentals, AIs that use time travel to communicate with their past selves, humanity has bootstrapped their way into the galaxy and in doing so split up onto various civilisations, with varying levels of technology and, most importantly, varying cultural values and ideals. Imagine a universe where other planets are, potentially, just a step through the wormhole away and where building something can be as easy as ordering a swarm of Nanites or a matter replicator to do it.<br/><br/>In this world, there is still an economy and people still trade things. Only now they trade ideas, technologies and plans and the core institution that allows this is the Patent Office. This organisation stands outside of the human civilisations and emplys members of all of them, but the driving force behind it are, again, the Transcedentals. (In the setting this is an open secret and while it makes some people nervous, most peopel agree that they are doing a good job. Also, it's hard to argue with somebody who knows what you're going to say.) The Patent Office gives out patents and sets prices for new technologies and makes sure that the developers get rewarded for their work. It also inspect missuse and lots of other stuff.<br/><br/>As you can guess, characters are inspectors of the Patent Office, which sounds much more boring then it is.<br/><br/>Design-wise, Sufficiently Advanced is a curious beast. On one hand, it really plays to the setting. Much space is given to the various civilisations, the technologies and their ramifications and so on. Most of the tech is at least potentially possible. (AFAIK, Colin Fredericks is actually a Physician or something.) There are rules describing how, for example, your advanced biotechnology increases your lifespan and how your age influences the skills you can have.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it mixes this very ... "simulationist" design with stuff generally not seen in SIM SciFi games, like a huge focus on dramatic editing and the direct influence of stories or the Core Values and the influence of the characters morals on the game. In a way, this game is very much not about the tech. (While, in another way, actually being about it.) While there is a list of examples of what sis possible at what tech level, it's not really a shopping list.<br/><br/>As an example: Characters are, at least in part, designed by the level of technology they have access to. These things even replace what is generally considered "attributes" in most other games. So a character doesn't have a Strength stat, he has stats like Stringtech, Biotech, Nanotech or Metatech. (The last being social and memetic techniques, for example.)<br/><br/>The culture a character comes from puts a weak ceiling on these stats. For example, the Masquerade, a civilisation built around, well, the freedon to choose who you are at any given moment, has a Biotech rating ranging from 1 to 8. This means that any Masquerared character has, again, have a Biotech rating in that range. (Actually he an get over that, but let's not go there. Most don't.) The twist is, though, that the player can freely choose what rating to give his character. There are no points to spend here, it's just "Choose a level you think fits."<br/><br/>But the higher your stats, the lower your "Import", ie. how important your character is in the story, which means that he will have less points to spend on themes and will have a harder time actuivating these Themes to influence the story. (To activate themes, you have to spend points called Twists, You start the settion with one of those and to get more of them, you have to suffer a Complication. The lower your Import, the bigger the Complication has to be to get a Twist.)<br/><br/>So there's a real Trade-off between being an all-powerfull Posthuman and being able to directly influence the story. Both have their place, but you'll think hard about what kind of character you want to play. (Incidently, this solves the "Jedi Problem" of powerfull characters dominating the game.)<br/><br/>So, like I said, a curious beast.

It doesn't make much of a difference with home/corner printing and does make it easier to read on a screen.<br/><br/>Right now, a sparse non-bleed border, no watermarks, with art just kind of plopped down strikes me as underusing the colour print medium.

There might be some stuff in there that's fantastic, but I can't see it all together and I'll never have a chance to browse a physical copy. I wish Lulu had some more advanced options between balls-out glossy full colour and greyscale (and the greyscale's a bit crude, too), but that's how POD works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122264/#Comment_122264" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T04:08:50+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  4:08AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <a href="http://suffadv.wikidot.com/demo" rel="nofollow">demo</a> is quite representative of the book in terms of art and layout.
