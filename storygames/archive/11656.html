We\u2019ve been getting together about once a month to try some \u201cout there\u201d stuff, and I have been really interested in seeing Ghost/Echo in action, so I convinced them to give it a try.<br/><br/>(It\u2019s hard for me to remember when exactly we decided on particular features of the setting or characters, but I\u2019ll try to stick them in when the come up.)<br/><br/>I described the basics of the rules, and we went through some of the /Questions so everyone could get a basic grasp on the setting and feel we were going for. We decided the Real World was based on Victorian England, but diverted from actual history when the aether and the Ghost World were discovered. About a hundred years had passed since then, and lots of technological developments were made. The Ghost World was a parallel dimension that people could travel to, but for the most part it was desolate and Wraiths made it dangerous. Crazy rich people might throw well protected parties there, but they were the exception, not the rule. The Real World is visible from it, sort of like an overlay, and you can see the outlines of real world people. There is also a Ghost Moon in the sky that shines a dull, red light over everything. One detail we didn\u2019t do much with was a hypothetical Wraith world where you end up if you die in the Ghost World\u2026<br/><br/>Once we got a basic grasp of the setting, they made characters. I decided the rule should be \u201cno one picks their own nickname,\u201d same as real life! So each of them assigned a name to another player. Hull turned out to be the soul of a man trapped in an aelectrical robot body, looking for the Stone that could help me escape immortality\u2026 he was drafted during the Great War and had seen a lot in the intervening years. Demon was a half-mad gadgeteer of sorts (made things from Metal) that knew an uncomfortable amount about Wraiths and the Ghost World. Grip was the leader of the crew, completely unflappable and managing complex situations like a pro. They worked the names into concepts pretty well.<br/><br/>We started them off being chased by Wraiths. The players decided that they were in the Ghost World because their fence had indicated the location of some Paper that had information on the anatomy/physiology of Wraiths (something they wanted in order to create a better defense against the Wraiths). Any text that was destroyed in the real world was transferred into the Ghost World, where it could potentially be found again. However, Wraiths are attracted to and feed off of knowledge and information, and Hull\u2019s years of experience had drawn some Dogs towards the crew. They were chased into the maze like Canals, when ahead of them an aether net snapped up across the alley, and a group of pirates on a platform above them started unloading their atherguns at the trio.<br/><br/>Hull launched his shoulder missiles to eliminate the Dog threat, but had to blow his entire payload to take them out. Meanwhile Demon shot off a harpoon, impaling one of the pirates. He used the trailing aelectric cable to swing himself and slice through the net. Grip didn\u2019t fare so well. He attempted to leap up to the pirate\u2019s platform and nearly made it, but had to avoid a salvo of sonixplosions and the collapsing aether net. The pirates were mostly dealt with, and Demon yanked one down with a grappler, accidentally destroying part of the building next to them in the process. Here we decided that massive damage in the Ghost World bled over into the real world, so there was some major collateral damage happening.<br/><br/>The crew was able to question the remaining pirate, who explained that he had been hired by Kilo (the crew\u2019s fence) to steal the Paper they were in the Ghost World to get. Apparently, they had hit the crew too early. They knocked the pirate out, left him to be consumed by Wraiths, and headed to Cathedral Hill. This is a massive complex of interconnected cathedral-esque buildings that reaches into the sky. The aetheric signature of the tome was there, and they really wanted it now.<br/><br/>They crept in, wary of any Wraiths that might be around. When they closed in on the signature, Demon headed in while Grip kept a rifle taken from the pirates out, ready to snipe any Hawks that might come down from the clouded upper area of the room. Hull stood watch behind them. After a few missteps and near discoveries by the Hawks, Hull decided the safest way for Demon to climb up was to draw the Hawks towards himself and let Demon free of that worry. The plan almost worked, but one Hawk started harassing Demon. He managed to lash the Hawk and ride it up to where the book was, but he was severely wounded in the process. Upon making his way back down, he was too weak to go on\u2026<br/><br/>Hull grabbed both of his friends and ran out, sliding from the Ghost World to the real world just out of range of the pursuing Wraiths. He then applied a ghostly healing technique and pulled the incapacitated Demon back from the brink of death. With the book in hand, they decided to pay Kilo back for his betrayal. Grip, the social badass of the group, contacted the Echoes. Here, we decided that Echoes were the titular \u201coracle steampunk faeries\u201d that you could bribe with a variety of Stones to get information from\u2026 and given time they would happily re-enact things that happened in the past (and possibly even those in the future). But you have to make sure not to piss them off. The Echoes followed Kilo\u2019s trail to The Nail and Bottle, a dance club of some sort. And so the crew paid them, and went to get their revenge.<br/><br/>Kilo was partying with some fine ladies and his two very large friends Bear and Sledge. The group went in and surprised him, but trying to avoid violence, they convinced him that they had taken his stash of goods and the only way to get it back was to come with them. He shooed the ladies away and he and his friends got up to leave. The players had come up with a plan. They were going to take out the bodyguards, knock Kilo out, and steal his memories with a device Demon made. Specifically, they were going to steal the information on all of his contacts and sell it to another fence that they liked better.<br/><br/>So, they all slid to the Ghost World, and the crew got Kilo, Bear, and Sledge all the way to the Undercross before surprising them with an attack. It kind of fell apart, with both Demon and Grip being overwhelmed by aelectric \u201caenergy\u201d and unconscious (respectively) before they were able to get the device attached to Kilo\u2019s head. That\u2019s when the shit really hit the fan. The information transfer was the last bump that a massive Viper needed to locate the six intruders into its domain and start attacking them. With his mates basically taken out by the fight with Bear and Sledge, Hull finished the download, temporarily stopped the viper, and escaped with a friend over each shoulder (double 6s!).<br/><br/><br/>A few comments:<br/><br/>I decided to use Fudge dice for the game, since I had them, and I thought the +, - and 0 were pretty iconic. It seemed to work fine. They all had 4 in a single color (one for the Goal, one for the required danger, one for the GM\u2019s danger, and one for a danger they could add themselves) and I kept some dice that were different colored for giving out advantage dice.<br/><br/>The game was ridiculous! The players were coming up with bizarre ideas left and right (oracle steampunk fairies!?) and they constantly reincorporated the thematic ties between the Ghost World and information. It really felt like a coherent setting even though it was just being built on the fly. I was a little iffy on the players\u2019 ability to just make up particular strengths and powers of their characters (especially Hull\u2019s player, who just made up new robot powers whenever), but it actually seemed to work. Plus, nobody went too overboard, and I think we could have called them on it if they had.<br/><br/>Everyone loved the game. It was adventurous, there was a constant sense that things were going to fall apart at any moment (thanks Danger!), and they had to make some really agonizing choices with where to assign their dice after their rolls. I thought they might unconsciously reject the idea of not having a well-defined character before the game began, but they just kind of rolled with it and the characters were cooler and more well formed than most of the games we play.<br/><br/>We had some trouble with the advantage dice. Well, that\u2019s not right\u2026 what I mean is, we realized that the story involved a lot of setbacks and screw-ups because there was so much danger going around but never more than one advantage die. It seemed to fit well for a gritty game in which everything you do can result in problems, even when you succeed. But it might be better in a higher-powered game to provide the players with more advantage dice more often. It would let them get out of the increasingly deep hole they were digging without making things worse. One of the players did compare the constant disasters favorably with Indiana Jones, so that's something!<br/><br/>I really had a good time. I am now entirely sold on Otherkind dice and I want to play more Ghost/Echo. Thanks for the great game, John.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264448/#Comment_264448" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T00:32:21+00:00" title="March 30, 2010 12:32AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You mention trouble with too many dangers coming about.

In fact, I think the number of times where they were just rolling for a single danger were pretty rare. It resulted in a lot of chaos and terrible things happening, but I kind of felt like that was the point of the rule. Every action comes with an inherent danger, but sometimes there are additional things at stake (like attracting attention or causing major collateral damage), and that stuff just pushes the action right along.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264530/#Comment_264530" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T12:53:14+00:00" title="March 30, 2010 12:53PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could have sworn I responded to this thread.
