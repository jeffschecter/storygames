                    I'm one of those for whom the first experience of anything approaching roleplaying was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Fantasy" rel="nofollow">Fighting Fantasy</a> books that became popular in the 1980s. I remember the glee I felt when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(world)" rel="nofollow">'Titan'</a>, guide to the Fighting Fantasy world came out! A setting book produced by a mass-market publisher that sold in fairly big number to eager kids such as myself.<br/><br/>And it's still on my booksgellf. It's battered, coffee-stained and slightly foxed but beneath the cheesy stock fantasy tropes, I think there's the potential for a pretty damn good game world in there. So, for those of us who remember The Warlock of Firetop Mountain, The Island of the Lizard King and the brain-metling Sorcery quadrilogy, let's awesomify Titan!<br/><br/>For a start off, it has some great (if redolent of a certain amount of cheese) villains already built in to the setting: Lord Azzur of Blacksand, Shareela the Snow Witch and so on. So I'd say lets make them even better. Port Blacksand should not just be powerful and scary as a piratical city state, it should have  vast, well-organised navy in addition to freebooters. And they have developed primitive cannon and harnesed ancient demons to power their most heavily armed and armoured warships.<br/><br/>And a set of mechanics that offer the same childhood thrill that FF offered but with the cool stuff that we also want as adults. <br/><br/>Anyone else with any ideas?<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                </div>

                            I am hungry for an awesomified Titan. However, since the actual source books are in my mum's attic I will withold from elaborating on the setting <i>qua </i>setting, and instead focus on what I want from a game derived from those terrific solo-game books.<br/><br/>System-wise, it ought to emphasise the meat of the gamebooks - traps, puzzles, and fights - without just falling back into standard D&amp;Dism. Avoid magic users: PCs should be warriors, rogues or a bit of both (hence <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=821&amp;page=1#Item_16" rel="nofollow">my thoughts</a> about doing it with Iron Heroes). Conflicts should be centred round actual objectives, rather than looting + leveling (hence my thoughts in the previously linked thread about Burning Wheel).  I think the reward/experience system should be something like <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1651&amp;page=1#Item_15" rel="nofollow">Wyrds</a>.<br/><br/>The game should be anti-hoarding; rather, any special items accumulated should be used up or given away fairly soon, and the mechanics should encourage that. (A straightfoward way would be to tie items, or their effects, to Keys or Beliefs).<br/><br/>The fighting fantasy books were always fairly lethal, if you ignore the use of that analogue version of 'save points' (using your fingers to preserve the page with your last decision point). I think you would want to preserve some of that. I think you would also be well served by fairly small groups, to retain that lonely, desperate feeling. In the books, you often met an ally who accompanied you part of the way, but was slain before the end. In a tabletop session, each player would be hoping that they would be the protagonist, rather than the avenged ally. (Essentially the Band of Brothers effect). And of course, some of these allies would turn out to be traitors, a common occurrence on Titan.<br/><br/>How about this: players can play either Protagonist character (PC) or Additional characters (AC). Everyone begins with a PC, but no new ones can be introduced within an adventure. <br/><br/>When one dies, the player is offered an AC to play -this could be pregenerated by the GM, or thrown together on the fly by the player, but with certain GM-proscribed details. One possibility might be drawing cards that each say "Traitor" or "Ally" and have adventure-specific Wryds/goals already laid out on them.  <br/><br/>After the end of the adventure, anyone playing an AC may convert them into a PC, or dump em and generate a new PC (in which case, the AC may enter into the GM's stable of NPCs, or return at a later date). There should either be reward implications of playing PCs - perhaps only they can achieve goals which produce Legends (adventure-scale Wyrds or resolution of Beliefs) - or some purely social-level recognition: "Man, we totally owned Deathtrap Dungeon!" "Ahem. Sander the crafty owned that dungeon - with a little help from his allies, of course." "...grumble..."                        </div>

Nope. It's even better than that! Fighting Fantasy was totally the thing when I was a lad. In fact, I started buying the old books on eBay a while back and reading them again. Man, I'd forgotten how much fun they actually were! I think the role of Fighting Fantasy in bring people into RPGs is ripe for re-appraisal.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                        </div>

Thoughts from anyone with experience of the system?<br/><br/>Actually, Joe Prince and myself recently played a one on one Fighting Fantasy dungeon crawl using the original FF system (stamina, skill, luck) and a deck of cards. It was immense fun and was what placed the thought of doing somethging with Titan in my head. The things is, for a mass market, glossy, large format book, it's a remarkably complete world guide that's good loads of stuff in it that could lead to great adventures. I mean, the entire 'Sorcery!' series of FF books drove me nuts as a young chap, but they ahve some brilliant stuff in them: Khare, Cityport of Traps! Like the previously mentioned Port Blacksand, it just bubbles with possibility.<br/><br/>I cannot believe we're the only two here with a youthful fondness for Fighting Fantasy. I feel like the old drunk down the pub, gibbering to students about how things was different in his days!<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                        </div>

                            You're not the only two.  In fact some of my best gaming memories come from playing Dungeoneer - the full-fledged fighting fantasy rpg.<br/><br/>Unfortunatly I've lost my copies of Titan (and Out of the pit, for that matter) and my memory's a little dodgy on the specifics.  Which makes it difficult to contibute.  But in general I support anything that makes Blacksand more important.  As far as I'm concerned that place was the centre of the world.                        </div>

Make us four.<br/><br/>The last time I have GMed Dungeoneer was last year - the adventure was "The Feathered Priests", one of my all-time favourites.<br/>But as much as I love the game, I have never used its setting, Titan, so I cannot help awesome-ify it. (My knowledge from the solo adventures is also a little sketchy as I have played/read them ... oh <i>so</i> many years ago.)

Seconded. A little paperback-sized, old-fashioned adventure RPG aimed at the book stores (instead of game stores) would be nice.<br/>That said, don't get me started on <b>Dragon Warriors</b>...<br/><br/>Dirk<br/>wonders what the British had in their water during the eighties                        </div>

                            I blame FF for everything.<br/><br/>Titan is a weird one though. It's a set of individual setting islands floating on a sea of vagueness.

                            I remember wandering around WHSmiths when I was 9 or 10 and finding the Fighting Fantasy books (with their distinctive green spine) as well as Dungeoneer and Out of the Pit (the Monster Manual of sorts, albeit without stats, iirc). It was my first introduction to fantasy, let alone roleplaying, and I lapped it all up. <br/><br/>Dungeoneer was my first ever roleplaying game, and I remember running the intro adventure for my little brother and a friend when I was 10. Then along came Heroquest (the boardgame) and Space Crusade, and eventually 40k and Warhammer, and roleplaying got pushed aside until Hogshead reprinted WFRP. But the whole time I was reading and playing Fighting Fantasy.<br/><br/>Titan, Blacksand and (more recently) Alansia (i think ...) still sit on my shelf with pride. They still possess this incredible charm and character that is as ingrained in me as Warhammer.<br/><br/>A friend of mine, Jamie (not James) Wallis, had the license for FF and converted a few of the books into d20 modules. There was a full on new FF rpg in the works but not sure what happened to it. I'd love to see FF get the Story Games AWESOMIFICATION treatment!                        </div>

                            I've picked up about half a dozen copies of those books over the years.  Every time I see one in a charity shop I buy it, just in case...<br/><br/>I remember buying the FF Player's Kit.  This consisted of a badge with the logo on, a pencil with "Fighting Fantasy" written down the side in gold, a pair of green dice and a pad of character sheets.  My original copy of Out Of The Pit was bought off a guy who lived nearby.  It was the original A4 size version and he'd gone through all his FF books and transcribed the stats of all the monsters and characters he could find into the inside covers using a biro.  Great stuff.<br/><br/>I think that Alex might have it there with Savage Worlds as a system.  I think it's got the right feel.  It's very easy to pick up and it's quite hard to actually die as a PC.  It's a system designed for Larger Than Life, Two Fisted characters doing epic things and kicking arse.<br/><br/>One thing that comes accross from the book is that you really <i>can</i> change the world, or at least the bit of it that you're in at the moment.  You <i>can</i> escape the dungeon and kill Baron Sukumvit.<br/><br/>Another thing about the books: Actually in the books you died quite a bit if you played by the rules.  There were a lot of traps and stuff that killed you outright if you made the wrong choices and it was often not obvious or apparent which choice was the wrong one.  So maybe a system whereby you can die in a really ignoble way and then "re-spawn" slightly earlier in the plot so you can try not to make the same mistake again?  That would be fun, if somewhat silly.                        </div>

                            I wonder if you could have two approaches - a hardcore version, appealing more to those people who played by the book, and a second chances version for the rest of us? (Festivus for tharestofus). <br/><br/>Rich, what do you think on the idea of restricting magic users, hoarding items and the like I mentioned? I'm aiming to keep things as close to the play experience, but on the other hand, Titan is a fantasy world that is filled with magic and all kinds of crazy bric-a-brac. I guess I wonder whether throwing all this stuff into the mix just makes it more like any other fantasy game. Does Savage Worlds have a big focus on magic and accruing stuff? Or could you run it as stripped-down, brawny badasses?                        </div>

                            I used to love those books as well - and I bought a couple of the them earlier this year and played through City of Adventure. Great stuff, even if I see a few things I would have liked to change (the sudden death syndrome, for instance).<br/>

I'm not sure if Savage Worlds is a good match for system, though, since the feel of that system is quite different to the feel I get when playing FF. In SW, you are a badass, competent character that can enter combat with mooks without much wory, but in FF every single encounter feels dangerous and, well, frustrating.                        </div>

                            I'm focusing on this a as a reasonably lightweight game.  That's because (a) that's what I like and (b) anything more serious has a vibe of "Grim, Fin-Headed Arserape" as the comic people call it.*<br/><br/>So I'm looking at the "Making a difference and kicking some arse" angle, rather than the "choose wrong and you're dead" part.  If a game is deadly and frustrating, I don't see why I would play it for fun.<br/><br/>Based on that Savage Worlds would work quite well.  Combat can be a lot of fun for example, because players have Bennies they can spend to reduce damage or re-roll if they do badly.  So people tend to try crazy stuff ("Only a minus 4? Sure I'll aim for his head!").<br/><br/>It has a magic system, but to be honest there's no harm in just not using it.  As in, a lot of the settings have no magic using PCs.  Traditionally, the characters in these books were not overt magic users.  You sometimes found a magic sword if you were lucky, but that was about it.<br/><br/>Hoarding...  Hmmm.  I'd probably be thinking of this as a series of games set in the same setting.  that is, there's a goal ("Kill the Warlock" or "Escape the Deathtrap Dungeon" for example) and that's a session of play or adventure.  After it's over, you throw away your characters and create new ones for the next game.  Those characters' stories are over.<br/><br/>* I don't know where this term originates, but it was probably Warren Ellis.  It's where people "modernise" classic superheroes by making them "edgy" "dark" and giving them issues.  Like MiracleMan turning out to be Hitler's love midget in the Alan Moore series, or Ultimate Giant Man beating his wife because she's mutant scum, but her loving him anyway.  Basically it's taking something people used to love for it's childlike innocence as a kid and making it into something fairly unpleasant, then expecting them to like it because hey, it's good 'ol Spidey!<br/><br/>I actually quite like that type of comic, because I hate superheroes.                        </div>

Or you do a Conan and start the next adventure with the same characters, but without any of your equipment and your characters washed up into some new and dangerous situation!                        </div>
