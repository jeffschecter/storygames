I spent hours thinking about how exactly to do it, but in the end I just decided it wouldn't work. I, also, wanted to save time. <br/><br/>I think having people come up with their own Clade is all-important, and it doesn't take that long. They have to care about who the character is and insert their own things to explore in the setting. Choosing Experiences, Tech, and Interface is pretty easy and doesn't take long at all. Memories take a little while, but again, having Users create their own memories is all-important. They may as well be reading a session transcript if they're not making Memories themselves.<br/><br/>epweissengruber's take could be interesting; give them a fully fleshed-out character and then go through the "2nd session &amp; on" process. Still, I think character creation followed by MRCZ creation is necessary, even for a one-shot (I think doing at least two sessions back-to-back is better, but you don't always have that luxury). Just do your best to make is snappy and laser-focused; print off Tech &amp; Interface &amp; Geneline sheets and have them pick, mostly. Tell them that the goal is to get this done fast so we can start the game proper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo" title="AlexMayo"><img alt="AlexMayo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo">AlexMayo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387005/#Comment_387005" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T13:57:52+00:00" title="August 13, 2012  1:57PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2012 1:58PM by AlexMayo.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the advice everyone!

I'm going to try and run Freemarket at Gencon too! <br/><br/>I ran a quick intro for my friends a few weekends back. A few things I found really helpful:<br/><br/>- have the challenges section of the book open to see the different levels of goals people can go after and what victory in a challenge actually means. each type of challenge varies pretty drastically.<br/>- have some NPCs statted up! I found that most challenges are against another NPC, directly or indirectly. Most users don't have enough flow to challenge the aggregate yet, unless it's a material challenge.<br/>- also have some MRCZs statted up! There's some examples in the book, but I think if you have an idea of what the stats would be like, the challenges and characters will be easier to tie into the memories the players are creating.<br/>- after a challenge happens, it creates TONS of fruitful ideas. think about how flow works, and the affects that challenge will have on the other users on the station, what friends they gain or lose, what plot hooks you can throw in at the end of a challenge. <br/><br/>I plan to mostly run it like I run a one-shot of Apocalypse World... just create NPCs, opposition, and story ideas based on whatever characters the players make in the first hour, and then roll with it. I was not going to bring pre-gens... because creating characters at conventions is one of my favorite things and I don't think it takes that long. Should be fun, I'm excited to play it more!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo" title="AlexMayo"><img alt="AlexMayo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo">AlexMayo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387072/#Comment_387072" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-14T11:01:42+00:00" title="August 14, 2012 11:01AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, thanks for the feedback!

The second time I had a lot more buy-in from the players; I did use pre-gens and it went well enough, although it took a lot of coaxing to get people to interact with the economy the way they're supposed to. The fact that the game encourages you to game the system was hard to get across at first, but eventually it clicked. I'm hoping it'll click earlier in the session this time.
