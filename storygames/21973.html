Stereotypes are tags referencing a common cultural library, instead of spending minutes or hours presenting a deep and unique character a player or game master can say "It's basically Shylock" and most people will get an idea of not just that characters character but also its place within society.<br/><br/>Ultimately, playing a game is about navigating a fictional space and this is better accomplished when the pieces are legible. I'm not saying that every character should be a stereotype, but doing so is a quick way to set the scene or introducing minor characters.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480979/#Comment_480979" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-04T19:19:29+00:00" title="March  4, 2019  7:19PM">March 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get what you say, and I think I agree. Using common referents is a basic narrative technique.<br/><br/>Just today I introduced a new character in our <i>Chronicles of Prydain</i> D&amp;D campaign. The dark wizard Morda is a fine fellow who just happens to look exactly like an off-Internet portrait of Voldemort the dark wizard. I picked a Voldemort picture as a shorthand because the canonical Morda does indeed look basically like Voldemort does in another fantasy novel 30 years later, but also because the shorthand helps players grasp the nature of the character quicker and better than if I tried to be original for originality's sake.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call all this "stereotype" necessarily, as there are other words, so I don't know if your disagreement might have something to do with the word choice.

The old ways of handling characters are (imo) outdated and need to be abandoned, because better techniques have been developed.<br/><br/>I'd define the purpose of a character being to communicate theme through a discrete fictional person, and that necessitates characters being presented realistically, because otherwise they're not discrete fictional people. They're just empty husks with vague concepts stapled to their faces.<br/>There was a yuri manga I read recently where an irrelevant male character who appeared in one scene to hit on the main character so that her girlfriend could swoop in to chew him out and look cool and heroic and instead of having a face, he had a piece of paper over his face that had written on it what translated to "irrelevant person" or "unwanted thing", and that's kind of how I'd describe "characters" who aren't discrete fictional people. They have their roles stapled to their heads and don't exist outside of that scrap of paper stapled to them.<br/><br/>I also wouldn't really call most of the "characters" in Homer/wuxia/superhero comics characters in the sense that I talk about characters. At my kindest, I'd call them something more like "concepts" or "archetypes" or perhaps even "named entities". At my harshest, I'd call them "inexcusably bad writing", but for the sake of this conversation, I'll try my best to be at my kindest. <br/><br/>I know this is probably a weird kind of take, but I feel like at this point, ya'll have come to expect nothing but weird takes from me, and I am nothing if I am not on brand. <img alt=":tongue:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":tongue:"/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481017/#Comment_481017" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-05T09:02:34+00:00" title="March  5, 2019  9:02AM">March 5</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I appreciate a firm stance on the realist question; having an opinion on such a fundamental question in the arts is much superior to ignorance of the question, even if I disagree on the conclusion [grin].<br/><br/>My own view is more mixed in that I think that both sides have thoroughly proved their ability to engage in the literary arts in a relevant way, all the while using their own understanding of how a character works in a story. This is something of an empirical take: the results prove the theory, and therefore neither approach can be said to be entirely useless. The big picture to me looks like more of a "right tool for the right job" situation. Having this opinion of course requires first having encountered relevant art of both sorts, so others might disagree simply because they've never seen one of these types in glorious action.<br/><br/>The implication is, of course, that while I think that we must whaffle about uncommitted on the question in general, it is very necessary to choose an approach in the particular: a given type of roleplaying game, or a given type of storytelling art, often gains clearly better utility from deftly expressed archetypes or painstakingly naturalist depictions. Understanding which is more appropriate to your specific purpose is paramount.<br/><br/>I guess I just wanted to clarify that the answer is pretty different depending on whether we're asking "which is better universally" or "which is better for my purposes". This sort of appropriate utility answers comes up a lot for technical matters in the arts, which I guess means that it's important to understand when we're talking about a technical matter of the arts as opposed to something else. If it is a technical question, the answer is likely to be "depends on what you're trying to do".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481018/#Comment_481018" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-05T09:11:10+00:00" title="March  5, 2019  9:11AM">March 5</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's totally fair!<br/>I'd argue that there's not any purpose that isn't enriched by realistically developed characters, and there's not any purpose that isn't hurt by archetypal, undeveloped characters, unless your purpose is to explicitly write bad fiction, but that's more of an anti-purpose, something that wouldn't really be relevant unless we were discussing say Dadaist art or other similar movements that are focused on trying to create anti-art.<br/><br/>(And, for the record, I've encountered relevant art of both sorts, and the sort with archetypal, undeveloped characters was uncapable of evoking emotion in me at all really, which like, I'm an easy person to evoke emotion in typically. Writing has to be pretty bad to not evoke any emotion at all in me.)<br/><br/>I'm definitely not like, aggressively against your take. I just feel like there's a lot in the development of various art forms that's really hindered by the frankly obtuse way people cling to the idea that things don't become outdated and obsolete. I wish I knew what art would look like today if we'd stopped using outdated and obsolete techniques for any purpose other than to deconstruct and subvert them, because I think that the average piece would be much higher quality, but like... capitalism sees that the old techniques are still selling, so capitalism has no desire to trash things for the advancement of art.

It has high and random lethality as a central part of its premise, so individual characters might not stick around for long. Having characters, both player characters and non-player characters, is important for portraying the challenges that social and psychological realities cause to commando operations. For example, knowing whether somebody is battle-hardened or not is often an important consideration.<br/><br/>I would argue that the game I describe above is not improved by the addition of realistic character development, because creating such depictions is too much work for too little gain in its particular context. Rather, the game favours an "economy of the brush" similar to some visual art forms: characterization relies heavily on archetypes, labels and categorization of complex phenomena into simple boxes. The game relies on a thorough battlefield simulation with quick and lightweight tools, so it would simply be inappropriate to enjoin that to fully unique and realistic characters. It would be like making a movie where everything else is cheap stick figures except cars are, for some reason, photorealistic.<br/><br/>You might be able to brush away my example by stating that it is of a worthless piece of art - that old school D&amp;D is an useless game, essentially. I don't think that you can claim that the game would be improved by changing it in this one regard, though; I'm confident on this because I have some little expertise on the game - why it's played, how it works, why its part are the way they are. I would be surprised by the intellectual hubris needed to claim that the game is worthless, but who knows.<br/><br/>Let me know if that example doesn't work for you - we can explore some other works. I disagree with the idea that archetypal characterization is outright outdated, and I believe that I can name many and varied examples of practical art where swapping this technique out would not be an overall improvement. I think that we would just need to find one example that you accept to prove that the case is not quite so black and white, and that an artist of the modern age still needs to do the actual work in choosing their brush.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481020/#Comment_481020" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-05T09:32:32+00:00" title="March  5, 2019  9:32AM">March 5</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2019 9:35AM by EmmatheExcrucian.">edited March 5</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a fair way of looking at it!<br/>I'd personally argue though that the realistic character development and the realistic portrayals would enrich something like old school D&amp;D. Would it be a lot of work with little pay-off? Definitely, but creating meaningful art is hard work. I'm generally of the belief that if something isn't hard work, it's probably not worth doing. <br/>Creating a piece that showcases how realistic people would act and feel in a situation like an old school dungeon is definitely better than creating a piece that showcases absurd caricatures in an old school dungeon. (I would also argue that there could be a lot of artistic merit to the cheap stick figures with photorealistic cars concept, especially in the context of say, a political piece about the ways that cars are damaging, the evils of cars because of the position they occupy in the lives of those in precarious situations under capitalism.)<br/><br/>I don't disagree that there's levels in modern writing where it's important to select from a variety of brushes, but I really don't think that whether or not to include realistic portrayals of characters is one of those places, and I don't think you're going to be able to convince me otherwise, no offense. It might be better to stop while we're ahead instead of this turning into parading out an endless stream of what you see as examples that then I disagree with and feel would be improved by realistic characters, until we both get really frustrated.<br/>I don't see it going anywhere good, basically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481021/#Comment_481021" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-05T09:48:54+00:00" title="March  5, 2019  9:48AM">March 5</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see how your own roleplaying game preferences reflect the idea that it's always worthwhile to put more effort and slow down things to increase the fidelity of portrayal. Many others would, however, say that in roleplaying as in other arts there is virtue in immediate and spontaneous things, too. It is <i>not</i> the case that any amount of effort put into crafting the individual elements of an artwork is automatically justified. Sometimes less is more simply because you improve the relative payoff by doing great things cheaply instead of slightly greater things at a great expense.<br/><br/>However, you are right in that there's no particular need for us to reach an accord on this.

For example, a stereotypical grandmother might be kind, caring, easily shocked or surprised, and really like knitting, tea, and cookies. (And you can get more specific once you draw culture into it, depending on your setting.)<br/><br/>I find that in an RPG, playing with those expectations is a useful tool. If I want to play to expectations, I say the grandmother likes knitting and bakes good cookies. More importantly, even if I don't say that, the players can reasonably assume that a positive interaction with her might involve tea and knitting, without us having to spell it out. We're establishing something familiar and we're able to interact with it right away. Then it fades into the background.<br/><br/> If, instead, I break expectations and say that her favourite hobby is Formula One racing and that she fought in World War II, I automatically draw attention to the character and bring her to the fore in terms of our attention. Now she's become a focus of play.<br/><br/>You make a good point that talking about this could be taken as an invitation to sanction the use of offensive stereotypes in gaming... and there is no way to know for sure which is the case until it is often too late. I'm not sure I see a solution to that, though (since anti-stereotypical characters could just easily offend someone).

If, instead, I break expectations and say that her favourite hobby is Formula One racing and that she fought in World War II, I automatically draw attention to the character and being her to the fore in terms of our attention to the character.</p></div></blockquote>\nI do get that. But I am realizing things are being slid into the argument that otherwise wouldn't be if we were making a clearer distinction between negative stereotypes and character types or stereotypes like the one you mention. Not just observing it here, but elsewhere online in similar discussions. I am getting the sense some people are advocating for the inclusion of standard tropes like the kindly grandmother. But there is also a creeping in of people arguing for ethnic stereotypes (and kind of sliding it in with the grandmother). Does this make sense? <br/><br/>I think what I am saying is most people, when they hear 'stereotype', assume you mean a negative ethnic or racial stereotype (growing up that is how the term was always used from what I remember). I even used the broader term myself earlier, calling my mother a stereotypical Italian American mom). Stereotypical grandmother character. No one will bat an eye. But stereotypical Asian character or Black character, people are going to be more uncomfortable at the table (and my group is mainly in 40 to 50 year olds who are not particularly sensitive about things, but the latter probably wouldn't go over well).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481044/#Comment_481044" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-05T19:24:38+00:00" title="March  5, 2019  7:24PM">March 5</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I agree with you!

The problem was that I created those characters in a vacuum and a lot of the characterization ended up unused.  <br/><br/>So it was a revelation for me when I got back into gaming and discovered Indie games and, especially with Apocalypse World, started to create simply sketched characters with a few bold facts known about them, and then developed them in the course of play, improvising and responding to inputs from the GM and other players.  <br/><br/>I feel like the goal was always the same for me, to create living characters I could inhabit, but the second method was much quicker, more fun, and less frustrating since everything I came up with about the character was relevant to play in some way. Either way, I end up musing about the character and making up little stories about them in my head, so it seems like there's a common endpoint but the newer way is better tech.<br/><br/>So, getting back to stereotypes -- I think a boldly drawn character, even stereotypical character, with a few unique points is a great starting point for indie game chargen.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481046/#Comment_481046" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-05T20:01:13+00:00" title="March  5, 2019  8:01PM">March 5</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just realized that I used the term stereotype different than you.

This even affects our perception of the real world and how we tend to fabricate our memories. It's worth noting, also, that even "realism" was/is, after all, a literary movement, and there's in fact no way to objectively capture reality without our language and ideology filters. And less so when creating collectively a narration.<br/><br/>I like to draw on stereotypes when creating NPCs in a hurry, and over time think of small ways to have that NPC break the mold or have them be a bit more nuanced.

Are all these instances now a stereotype? Is that first instance now a stereotype?<br/><br/>It seems to me a great deal of difference between good character and bad stereotype is in the execution, rather than originality or complexity.
