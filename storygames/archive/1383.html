                    (This is for the 'Mainstream Industry Learns from Indie' file)<br/><br/>Ok, so I just learned that a new gaming store opened up in my area (actually, games and comics, which is even more tempting, really)...and, well, actually almost 2 months old, but it's new to me!  Anyway, I went in, looks nice, clean, no odd smell, and the staff were quite pleasant.  So, I wanted to buy something from them.  That something ended up being True20 Adventure Roleplaying.  I liked Blue Rose, so I figured that it couldn't hurt to give Green Ronin a little more of my money.<br/><br/>So, I'm sitting, drinking my coffee, flipping through it this morning.  I know the basics from Blue Rose, so I went straight for the settings--and the Arabic one just knocked my socks off (yay for Paradigm Concepts, whoever they are) because it is so clear someone on that design team has been paying attention to the indie scene.  Clinton talked about how conviction is cool in Blue Rose--the Caliphate Nights setting takes the lid off of that.  It adds two new uses for your conviction point--storytelling and weaving.<br/><br/>A player can spend a conviction point in order to tell a story that will improve their chances of doing some other task in game--and when they tell the story, they become the narrator and everyone else (including the GM) gets a character to play through the story.  There is a time limit (30 minutes), but, still, how cool is that?  One option for the story is to provide background to something in the ongoing game--'how this came to be'--now the main GM doesn't have to accept the story as true, but, still, how cool is that for a *D&amp;D* spinoff system?<br/><br/>And weaving let's a character add something to the narrative--sort of like a declaration of fact in Donjon.  It requires a roll which can lead to complications ('Yes, but' or 'No, but').  Neat!  Again, rules state the GM may 'turn off' this feature, but its very existence makes me happy.<br/><br/>I am especially tickled by the possibilities inherent in the storytelling rules--with just a little work, you could totally take the hinges off and have a cool, cooperative storytelling D&amp;D.  Allow characters in each storytelling frame to spend conviction to open up new stories, keep the limit on 3 stories ongoing at a time, keep the time limit...that is pretty cool, indeed.  It's no 1001 Nights cool, but, come on, it's basically D&amp;D.                </div>

                            Wow, I totally missed that part! That's excellent.<br/><br/>I hear, by the way, that the new Basic Set for D&amp;D 3.5 has... no attributes, just bonuses for the pregen characters. Looks like someone at Wizards has been paying attention...                        </div>
