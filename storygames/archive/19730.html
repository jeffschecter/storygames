Doesn't like the dice/rules, just says what she wants to happen and lets others roll, loves story <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/> relative newbie Advanced D&amp;D. gonzo high fantasy fan. <br/>H: some exposure - WoD and Exalted. Gets majorly in character, loves following stories and builds on other character's activities. Loves being the sidekick.<br/>*J: "rookie" of about 30 odd sessions of Exalted. Tends to be contrary and was the group Necromancer -  also the doctor/healer in a bunch of "heroes"... lots of laughs out of that though <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>K: Indie-game fan. Plays for the narrative and character discovery through play.<br/>*M1: Veteran. Burning Wheel, Reign, WoD, Pendragon, etc. Driving player, loves intimate, character driven plotting.<br/>M2: Played everything under the sun <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Details driven player.

The 4 starred ones are the "driving players" as I call them. They are the ones that tend to hog the spotlight a lot and/or drive the actions of the players at the table.<br/><br/>We ended the last game as the party pretty much was breaking into 2 distinct groups that basically were too far away and had such different goals that they either were not interacting or pretty much social PvP which wasn't that comfortable at our table.<br/><br/>Anyway, we are all enjoying the group dynamic and having a ball, and want to continue on, and are now starting to look for another game to play.<br/><br/>Major requirements for potential games: <br/>- handles anywhere 3-9 players at a single session.<br/>- can cope with players dropping in or out at different sessions. (might miss up to a couple of months of game at a time)<br/>- not too crunchy... although they handled Exalted really well, its at the very far limit of crunch and we houseruled it a lot to simplify.<br/>- can do dungeon crawl style, up to political intrigue, or small scale organisational (merchant house owners, spy ring etc) games<br/><br/>yep, nothing too hard right?<br/>We've mainly played nWoD Mage and Exalted. With some Apocalypse World and Sage of the Icelanders thrown in a few times. Also regularly play boardgames (which will keep us going till we get next game up and running...)<br/><br/>So - ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437912/#Comment_437912" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-28T19:52:45+00:00" title="August 28, 2014  7:52PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3:16<br/><br/>Dungeon World                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437913/#Comment_437913" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-28T20:04:25+00:00" title="August 28, 2014  8:04PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say that it mostly comes down to how you handle the game.<br/><br/>Soloplaying with one player: the game master constantly be there at all time steering everything.<br/>Playing with 3-4 players: the game master is always present but now always driving.<br/>Playing with 6-7 players: the game master becomes a backseat driver.<br/><br/>I'm guessing that you're also prefer campaign play before one-shots?

Tried Fiasco but it fell a little flat. Everyone seems to like their characters, although not really tried much else tbh.<br/>Honestly, the GM is mostly backseat all the time, except the first few sessions to kick everything/setup situation. <br/><br/>K and S1 used to play games of Mage and Exalted in another group years before<br/><br/>Icelanders was actually done during the playtesting for that game - and considering this is in Iceland, it was a real hit. Everyone loved it and we got some amazing results out of it - Actually that was one of the seeds of this group here in Reykjavik <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Played a few times with different people until the first core group K, S1, M1.<br/><br/>Apoc world next - that lasted around 6 sessions of just pure badassery <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> 6 players. Lots of comparisons to movie "Doomsday" and game "Fallout" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Word got around and we did a one-shot Mage game for K, H, M1, M2, S1 and T (T and H being complete rpg newbies), - that kicked off a 50 odd session game that just plain rocked. Was GMd a lot like Apoc World, but more freedom to the players to make up what/how they did things. Story developed pretty much by players introducing ideas from their rolls, or from feedback after game sessions. Ie "I liked X, can we find out for about that" or "i'm going to check if anyone is watching us (rolls excellently) well fancy that, there is someone shiftily looking at you - what do they look like? Or "That magic blows up in your face, what happened?" <br/><br/>They literally changed the world - went up into "Supernal world" and changed the rules of the world thanks to some artifacts/ritual.<br/><br/>Then Exalted was put forward as "The afterworld - what the world was like once you changed it". We got some uncovering of stuff that tied back to the mage game (Lost temple with statues/writing. References to "Lords" who had legends that recalled the Mage characters. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> But the game was very much its own thing. Actually the more than 2/3rds of the game was played as non-exalts. This probably set the tone much better and when they became exalts was when the motivational issues came to the front - they started to overcome things... too easily? It was exciting to go, oh wow I can roflstomp those buggers from a few sessions ago, but then they "fixed" many of the more mundane problems that had been driving the characters and never really got the hang of the "Epic Motivations" that Exalted seemed to want. Due to the way we played the game (more drop-in drop out semi sandboxy/west marches) once they got exalted they started drifting - even had 2 different "secret bases".<br/>But it went really well and kept growing as friends of friends were brought in due to word-of-mouth <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>( we have semi-session logs from the mage and exalted game if anyone is interested just PM me)<br/><br/>I actually have 3:16, never played it though. Sounds like an excellent idea tbh <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>We have some Marvel fanatics among us - currently S1, S2 and D are slowly brainwashing C to love Marvel  so Marvel Heroic might get some traction. Its also sounds pretty simple so I could grab it and see how it plays. I've never played any Cortex stuff honestly.<br/><br/>I was also thinking of "In a Wicked Age..." (which has had a few one-off sessions with a different group), "Agon", and strangely enough "Ars Magica", Pendragon, and Call of Cthulu have come up (M2 and S1 brought up those last 3, but they sound interesting)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437920/#Comment_437920" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-29T03:19:50+00:00" title="August 29, 2014  3:19AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want another game to play for 50 sessions, I hear <b>Pendragon</b> is great for that.  The basic percentile dice task system doesn't contribute much, but you sound like you know how to make such games work, and the large-scale systems for time passage and family fortunes and reputation are very cool.<br/><br/>I imagine some of your players will love <b>Marvel Heroic</b>, but others might be annoyed by the dice-pool building or all the comics references they don't know.  I wouldn't call the system crunchy, but it does require a bit of attention.  I also don't know anyone who's played it with their own characters instead of the Marvel ones.  I'm sure you could make it work, but you'd probably want to get on the same page first about challenge (do we need to optimize or can we just roleplay?) and Marvel content.<br/><br/>My guess would be that <b>Cthulhu</b> and <b>Wicked Age</b> don't fit what you're looking for long-term, but if you're looking for a change of pace, both games have their awesome parts.  <b>Ars Magica</b> makes sense to me, but I haven't played it, so now I'm really guessing.  Dunno much about <b>Agon</b>.<br/><br/>I think <b>The Shadow of Yesterday</b> or its system book <b>Solar System</b> would be a good long-term fit in that the systems for character change and growth are front and center, and you can do either epic or gritty fantasy with it pretty easily.  Personally, I loved the TSoY setting but found that the book lacked some GMing and facilitator orientation that I needed; I've heard Solar System is better on the "how to run a good game with this" advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437922/#Comment_437922" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-29T05:19:48+00:00" title="August 29, 2014  5:19AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also: Is there any chance of recruiting one person from this group to co-GM/split the group with you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437924/#Comment_437924" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-29T05:32:54+00:00" title="August 29, 2014  5:32AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            well, actually S1 often helps with a lot of the rule stuff, helps other players with how to do stuff, and often helps with background setup, but hates GM'ing at the table                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437926/#Comment_437926" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-29T06:32:23+00:00" title="August 29, 2014  6:32AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2014 6:33AM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, campaign play seems to be the default.

Yeah, the game master usually takes the responsibility for setting up the game.<br/><br/>One game that comes into mind is <b>Shadowrun</b>. The rule system is heavy so it falls flat on your non-crunchy requirement, but the setup for the world suits at least two of your goals: having the players being able to drop out, and you play out heists which is basically a different kind of dungeon crawl. So any kind of heist game?<br/><br/>If you could understand Swedish, then I would had recommended <b>Svart av kval, vit av lust</b>.

We're going for a change of pace to be more sci-fi and going to be making our own setting (using microscope)<br/>The game themes we heavily discussed were related to cyberpunk/shadowrun, Babylon5, Star Trek, Battletech. A more "procedural" game where they meet challenges, but their core is narratively safe.<br/>System wise we're looking very hard at the Cortex+ stuff (Leverage, Smallville), with some peeking at cyberpunk2020, Traveller, and WoD<br/><br/>Thanks again y'all                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
