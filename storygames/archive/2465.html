                    I have the Dungeons &amp; Dragons SRD on my laptop, and when I get bored in lecture I haul the thing out and fiddle around with it.  Then I get all crazy, and stop listening to the lecture, and next thing I know I'm lying in a gutter in Atlantic City at 5 in the morning muttering about prestige classes and how best to fight pixies.<br/>
<br/>
D&amp;D is, for lack of a better word, "potentially infinite prep."  If you had the three Core Books, and no players, you could spend <i>years</i> building your perfect little setting, and designing little adventures to run in your imagination.  From a particular design standpoint, this is a brilliant feature: you can "pseudo-play" the game by yourself, and though it's not entirely satisfying it does fire you up to play the game someday.  So the fact that the books aren't <i>useful</i> doesn't mean you should stop buying/reading them.  (In another sense, though, this is a bad thing, because non-gamers are like, "You spent all that time . . . for <i>what</i>, exactly?")<br/>
<br/>
As I understand it, a <i>huge</i> part of the larger RPG community does this: buy books, read the books, get excited about someday playing the game, then never play the game, but re-read the books, etc.  Whether this is part of the collector mentality, or boredom, or whatever, I have no idea.<br/>
<br/>
I've generally broken this habit, since a very large number of Story Games are "finite prep"--in fact, very low (or even zero) prep is a highly desired feature.  Furthermore, most Story Games explicitly require creative collaboration from the other players at an early stage of the process.  You cannot "pseudo-play" Capes or Trollbabe.  Sorcerer and its supplements explicitly discourage "pseudo-play" in the text.<br/>
<br/>
Now, here's my question:<br/>
* Are there Story Games which encourage pseudo-play in the D&amp;D style of building your silly little worlds, and populating them, and creating adventures for nobody to go on?  (I suspect BW/BE comes close to this, but I don't really know.)<br/>
<br/>
* What point would a "pseudo-play" feature serve in the context of Story Games?<br/>
<br/>
* <b>(This is the allegedly constructive point of this post)</b> When I recover from my periodic D&amp;D benders, I always feel kind of sick, in part because I don't have anything to show for it that my "sober" mind would appreciate.  Still--is there something like, I don't know, "Story Legos" where you can fiddle around with, fitting archetypes together, building situations and resolving them, to your heart's content?  Like, solitaire for story-gamers?  (I realize the most direct way to do this is to write a short story.  But for various reasons, including powerful self-criticism, this isn't the lighthearted, relaxing process that playing a game would be.)                </div>

                            Okay, I will embarrassingly raise my hand from the back of the class.  The BW books are one of my favorite things to flip through before going to bed at night.  And this morning the first thing I did was sit in front of the computer with a mug of coffee to write up three pages of "adventure seeds" that were in my mind for that game.  This is distressingly similar to my memories of 25 years ago sitting in my room alone reading the castle building rules in the DM's Guide for the 400th time.<br><br>Who knows if I'm ever going to run BW.  I would really like to, but the commitment of even a short campaign is much different than the "show up if you like" feel of doing a Roach or 1001 Nights one-shot.  <br><br>I'm going to go out on a limb here, but my guess is that the difference between a game like D&amp;D or BW and other games such as Universalis or Shock is that the former have a lot of rules for doing many different things.  They are built more as sims and thus you can read the rules and get a picture of how the game will play in your mind.  You start to think, "Oh yeah, they could find that key in the caverns and then later on do a Circles test to find the owner..." and next thing you know you are writing a fricken story.  And the more invested you get in that story the more you will get frustrated when the players don't follow it.  Thus the twin demons of "yeah well I never ran the game" or "all aboard the railroad!"  I know I have been guilty of both.<br><br>Whereas when you take some of the thinner volumes that have come out lately; the rules seem like more of a framework and there's much less hand holding involved.  When I read The Mountain Witch, I really dug the rules but had a really tough time figuring how what the game was going to be like.  "The players can call for NPCs or scenes that relate to their dark fates?"  Things like that really reduce the 'Dungeon Master' down to more of a director or facilitator role and give a lot of power and responsibility to the players.<br><br>And some recent games are written in such a way that the rules itself are hard to figure out.  They are complex enough that you are just going to need to see them play out at the table.  There is no "ooh, let me imagine how a game of Polaris would play out" in my brain.  It's written more like poetry and less like a technical manual.<br><br>Personally I like having both kinds around.  Some books make me imagine and dream a lot and that doesn't seem bad.  And when I'm ready to play, there are other books that I will pull out and bring straight to the gaming table without hours of prep.<br><br>And James, I wouldn't worry about not having anything to "show" for it.  I'm not particularly sure how much I have to show after reading a magazine article, playing a computer game or taking a hike.  But they all stretch parts of my brain or body and I enjoy doing them.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

In BE, world-building is a specific step in the play process, and thus needs to happen with a group. BWr is ideally approached in this way as well, based on my experience.<br><br/>However, you could probably fiddle with the <i>Monster Burner</i> and create creatures and lifepaths for either game 'till the cows come home.                        </br></div>

                            Yeah, BW does allow, if not encourage, this. You just want to break out the Monster Burner and work up your own Settings &amp; Sub-settings... and i cannot help but tinker with the magic systems. The game's wiki host a whole list of these sorts of "prep" fans have made for their own games. <br/><br/>So, it's definately a part of the experience. I imagine BW draws this sort of activity because of its rigid (compared to other indie games) definition of character traits (lifepaths). In contrast, you wouldn't make a library of Dogs traits beacuse they're tied intimately to the character, and not the world. <br/><br/>(So, i'd guess that the expectation of long-term play &amp; multiple characters is the root cause of this noodling around with burning up new lifepaths, traits, etc.)<br/><br/><br/>A similar thing might be the large interest shown in adapting Dogs and tSoY to particular settings - there's an expectation (or actuality) of play, but it's fun on its own, too...                        </div>

<p>I have a couple thoughts here.</p>
<p>First, I use <em>Burning Wheel</em> the same way Chris does. I've played it twice, bought the books (and the Monster Burner,) but will never run the game myself, or suggest to a group we should run it, mainly because of the lifepaths feature. I mean the lifepaths are the reason I won't be playing it <strong>and</strong> the reason I bought the books, simultaneously; I found that they spark ideas, but that's not the way I want to play a game.</p>
<p>Second, I think calling wasted effort, or asking "why not just write a story?" is missing the point. Games like these, even if not played, spark ideas, which you can use in other games, or in a story you write, so <em>that</em> becomes their usefulness. There's something about laying out idea building-blocks and describing how they can fit together that makes creativity easier. Stories and movies can spark creativity, too, but it's tainted with someone else's story; roleplaying game books strip things down to bare components. This is why GURPS worldbooks ppeal to people who hate GURPS.</p>
<p>What might be interesting is a solitaire "game" written only for this purpose. A manual for brainstorming and castle-building, so to speak, that is never meant to be "played out loud".</p>

                            Hey James:<br/><br/>I sorta look at that infinite prep as the geek equivalent of model railroads. That's a hobby designed for endless fiddling.

                            Hmm, first, "pseudo-play" is a good term, but I think we should avoid using it in a condescending way.  Nearly everybody does it, at least to the extent of riffing off of existing concepts and coming up with new interesting ideas.  <br/><br/>The difference for me, personally, between my pseudoplay now and pseudoplay in my pre-Indie days when I was an obsessive White Wolf fanboy, is that then, I didn't have any idea how to make my cool ideas translate into play -- I could see the potential, but I couldn't see how to get there.  <br/><br/>Since getting turned on to story games, I'm both more aware of the difference (and when to stop dicking around and get to playing), and more empowered to do it. <br/><br/>Finally, I've totally done pseudo-play with Sorcerer.  Since I've never been able to get any of my Sorcerer games off the ground, all my attempts at one-sheets and Sorcerer settings are nothing but, I think. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Matt">@Matt</a>: Totally.  My dad is a model railroad buff, too, and his involvement in the hobby is confined to visiting stores and occasionally buying a new engine or some trees or something.  He hasn't run the layout since I was a baby.  I thought that was weird, but it's probably pretty common.                        </div>

That's a good point, Danny.  After I played The Mountain Witch I took another look at the rules and thought, "wow, this would work great for a WW2 Guns of Navarone-type setting."  And so it let me to read the rules more to gain a deeper understanding before creating a mod of it.  I'm sure the setting challenge has been causing people to take second looks at favorite games.                        </div>

Which is <i>great</i> if you want to grab the game, prep fast, and go.  But it doesn't have the same "playing with LEGO's" feel that grubbing around in D&amp;D mechanics gives you.<br/>
<br/>
Matt, you're right--it's model railroading, or any other obsessive-hobbyist activity.  I'm willing to admit it contributes to many of the unhappy trends in the RPG hobby field.  But sometimes it's fun, too, and I kinda wish it were possible to do it in (a few) Story Games.<br/>

Danny: I do it in Sorcerer too from time to time, but I feel bad because I end up tainting that "world"--I've invested too much in it, that I can never use it in play.                        </div>

                            I know we have a sort of unspoken rule about not hyping your own shit when talking about these things, but i'm going to break that rule a little here because i'm trying to specifically address this issue with my upcoming game Sweet Agatha.<br><br>The game is really played in two parts, the first being the readers interaction with the physical game "book." As you are reading a story you are asked to physically cut apart the book (like with scissors), by doing this you are creating materials that will be used in play later. Also, you are slowly making it impossable to complete the reading. (this serves a number of both literal and metaphoric purposes, the game is all about the mysterious dissapearance of a young woman, the cutting precludes you from knowing the ending, the mystery litterally falls apart before you're eyes and becomes a chaotic mess of clues and connections)<br/><br/>I think that users should engage the material physically, i think they should make worlds and stuff, and i am interesting in wholly embracing this activity as one that is integral to the game's play. I am seeking to create games that do this. <br/><br/>In the course of working on a game that focuses so heavily on reader interaction and the "pseudo-play" aspect of our hobby I've begun co-authoring an article with Nathan "carry" Paoletta that discusses the disconnect between the very single person act of reading instruction manuals and the very participitory nature of actually playing an RPG. Why do we choose such a medium to describe such an act? This article will be (in all likelyhood) published in this year's Push.<br/><br/>I hope this post is helpful and not masturbatory. I don't want to sound like an advertisement, only, to present that this kind of thinking can (and perhaps should) come at the design level, not just at the end user level.                        </br></br></div>

                            I do this all the time with both D&amp;D and WoD books. But note that everything I do is intended for play. It's like painting tiles. You paint a thousand tiles, then you decide what 100 tiles you want on your floor and how to arrange them.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people have thousands of tiles and never intend to ever let a visitor's foot sully them, but I don't see the point of that. I am constantly tearing apart books and ruining the contents by altering them beyond recognition. But it's all in service of play.                        </div>

Interesting, Interesting. I'm failing to see how that works, physically (ok, ok, you follow randomized reassembly instructions?) , but it sounds like a very, very cool format for a mystery. (Or time-travel debacle...)                        </div>

                            Reminds me of a guy I knew at school.<br/><br/>I used to play Shadowrun a lot, in which the character creation and buying stuff/cyberwear etc is kind of a mini game within the game.  What combination of stuff, which "build" gives the highest Initiative score, the best Body score etc.<br/><br/>I used to build a couple of characters after getting each sourcebook.  I remember 2nd ed coming out in, what, 1991?  I built a whole bunch of characters to see how you could game that part of the system.  Then when the book of cyberwear came out, I built a couple more to make use of all the neat toys in that.<br/><br/>This guy, Simon his name was, he used to sit in and build Shadowrun characters pretty much as a hobby.  He told me once that he used to run a fight with each one where the character he'd just built was outnumbered 4:1 by copies of the Street Samurai from the core book.  If that character won the fight 2 out of 3 times through, he'd consider it an OK build.  He wouldn't consider play a character in someone else's game that hadn't won three in a row.<br/><br/>I've found this conversation about this in Story Games very interesting.  I've always kinda been of the opinion that the thing that makes story games what they are is the fact that almost all of the creative energy is at the table during play, that everybody at the table is creating the story together rather than exploring a story that the GM (or some dude who wrote an adventure) has created in advance.  I'd always just assumed that story games pretty much precluded any kind of pseudo-play.                        </div>

<p>Just an observation: does it seem to everyone else that pseudo-play is more likely to occur when you have character/town/vehicle/world creation system that has a lot of interacting levels of design? For example, in Rich's <em>Shadowrun</em> example, the combos in a particular build affect higher-level elements like Initiative and Body. If that's the case, story games might have less pseudo-play because they have less pervy systems for character building, rather than because of a focus on creativity at the table.</p>
<p>I remembered another game with a strong pseudo-play element for me: Chaosium's <em>Stormbringer</em>/<em>Elric</em> has a build-a-demon system that I liked to brainstorm with.</p>

                            My current twinkle-in-my-eye design is sort of leaning this way, so I'm very interested in this topic.<br/><br/>I am, first of all, interested in John's question, which I will rephrase into the terms I was using as I read the thread: "Is lonely fun only possible in games with large amounts of discrete pieces?"  You can't make characters unrelated to a game in <em>Primetime Adventures</em>, because you write your own stats and you write, what, five of them?  It may be fun, but it's got no "staying power" as a stand-alone activity (which it's not intended to be, so that is most assuredly not a criticism).  on the other hand, you can make Exalted characters for days, cause there are books and books and books of stats and charms and sorcery and yadda yadda yadda.<br/><br/>The other thing I'm interested in is trying to articulate what's fun about this activity.  Because it is fun, totally.  I still enjoy rolling up mutant animals in <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Other Strangeness</em>.  But what is it, specifically, that that process provides that is so entertaining?  Is it the surprise of getting an odd roll (mutant <em>chicken?</em>)?  Is it working on details and then all the sudden something "clicks"?  Is it simply imagining the character or situation in your mind's eye, a sort of guided day dreaming?<br/><br/>So James, if you don't mind, I'd like to add those two questions to your initial three (my answers to which are, "Burning Wheel and Sorcerer," "Not sure, that's why I ask my second question," and "Wouldn't it be neat if you could tell yourself a story with the assistance and support of the game, sort of like Choose Your Own Adventure?")                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>I think some of it has to do with game effect or strategic control, or something like that. I've noticed that even in games with large numbers of discrete, crunchy pieces I don't do this as much if I can find a perfect build. If there is one way that is obviously the best way, I'll quickly lose interest in doing other builds on that model. If there is one way that is the best way for everything, I'll be out of interest in no time flat. <br/><br/>Which, I think, is also part of the PTA thing -- not only does it take 5 seconds, but all builds are going to hit the table more or less equal. There is no best way, but there also is no better way. (In terms of doing something without a game to contextualize in, anyway -- the "better" part of PTA means "hits the themes better so that you'll get more fan mail from the particular people around the table" in so much as it means anything at all.) <br/><br/>In TMNT you not only have lots of pieces, you have randomization that keeps you from always getting the killer build (mutant weasel with the assassin/ninja training package, acrobatics, gymnastics, boxing, and ninjitsu), and the oddity of the results and the possibility of the kewl factor of some crazy animal (you want a different build with a sparrow than an elephant) means that there are a lot of possible builds that are all awesome. Plus, the fact that the awesome here doesn't just come from the tactical element, but also from the kewl element. Really, you want to make not just the most ask kicking build, but the kewlest possible built (mutant albino camel that maxes out his desert survival and uses thermographic goggles so he can operate only at night). <br/><br/>BW has some of this, as you want to balance your lifepaths and make them complete and interesting, fleshing out the culture, giving a good balance of tactical options, and doing nifty things with possible character backgrounds and circles at the same time. Sorcerer can have a little of that with the best demon build, descriptors, or whatever, as there is a lot of room for creativity and numbers-juggling there (though it ends up mattering less in game then you'd think it would, most of the time). Dogs, otoh, really doesn't matter -- because of the way traits work there is no way to best out your Dog's traits, though you may be able to cool them out, but without both elements, it doesn't stay fun for long.                        </div>

I would say so, at least for the style of pseudo-play that I'm most familiar with. At the most basic level, the "lonely fun" of a game is probably going to be gone once you thoroughly understand all possible permutations of the game's discrete elements and how they combine to form tactics, strategies, and so on. For example, tic-tac-toe ceases to be interesting once you fully comprehend the extremely small number of ways you can meaningfully place your mark on your turn - barring special cases like programming an AI, you can't have much lonely fun with tic-tac-toe. In contrast, the lonely fun of go is enjoyed by many people as a lifelong hobby.<br/>

From a hardcore, <a href="http://www.sirlin.net/archive/playing-to-win-part-1/" rel="nofollow">playing-to-win</a> gamist perspective, lonely fun is an essential part of the game experience. Playing a game with this mindset is as much about developing skill as it is about winning, and playing the game alone is vital to this process - it's training. I can't think of a single professional poker, chess, or Magic:  the Gathering player who isn't regularly pseudo-playing their game of choice (actually, that's not true, but those oddball players are notable for this quirk alone!). I have some small experience with this from back in high school, when playing in (and winning) local M:tG tournaments was my part-time job and debate tournaments were my hobby. I had to learn how to pseudo-play effectively, simply to stay competitive; every mistake I didn't learn from could cost me real money, after all. After doing this sort of thing long enough, it became second nature: I was engaging in the lonely fun of those activities pretty much all the time, which meant that I was both having fun all the time and getting better all the time.<br/><br/>This extends to sports, too. You may have heard of visualization-training or imaging-training, where an athlete pictures some scenario and mentally executes their proper response. Also, isn't solo-training for a sport a form of pseudo-play? Those long hours of hitting tennis balls off of the garage or practicing free-throws aren't actual play, after all, but are satisfying all the same.<br/><br/>Bringing this back to RPGs, I think the same principles apply. If you're playing DnD with a gamist approach, every theoretical character build you make or mock battle you run through and evaluate translates into greater potential effectiveness at the table - you're learning, which is fun, and are more likely to win, which is also fun. However, even if you never apply the skill, you've still had the fun of learning and the practical experience of training your analytic abilities and memory. Since DnD is an absolutely huge game, you can go through these exercises almost endlessly. Plus, while the massive, self-contradictory complexity of the game is hardly elegant design, it has the advantage of taxing one's memory more - at least in my case, since I lonely play without access to my books, then double-check myself for accuracy.<br/><br/>Any massive RPG that's even vaguely balanced should have similar potential for lonely fun, at least for the type of player I'm describing. I gather from this thread that there's a directly analogous experience for a simulationist player. I suspect that practice in composing a story might have a similar appeal to a narrativist player, in addition to trying to maximize the cool factor that Brand mentioned.<br/><br/>Anyway, for me, learning is fun. I learn from both pseudo-play and actual play, and I find that each holds a unique learning experience.<br/><br/>Edit: I suppose it would be best to say that, to support this sort of lonely fun, you need either a lot of rules or a lot of strategic depth. DnD, Shadowrun, and their ilk have the former, while go, poker, and the like have the latter. Either way, you've got a lot of game to think about.                        </div>
