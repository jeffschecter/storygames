Think Chronicles of Narnia/Vision of Escaflowne/Twelve Kingdoms/El-Hazard/Labyrinth.  (Maybe even The Wizard of Oz, though it's a bit of a stretch).<br/><br/>I'm currently stuck on coming up with the basics of the resolution system, and I'm hoping that someone might give me some suggestions that will get me moving in the right direction.  See, I've got some fairly specific ideas about what sort of character traits should play into the resolution system, what kind of dilemmas it should force, and what player behaviors it should reward, but I'm having trouble turning all that into an actual dice mechanic.<br/><br/>I originally threw out this idea on my blog, in this post:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.evilbrainjono.net/cgi-bin/blog/showblog.cgi?permalink=491&amp;showcomments=true" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.evilbrainjono.net/cgi-bin/blog/showblog.cgi?permalink=491&amp;showcomments=true</a><br/><br/>Since then I've done a lot more thinking about it.  Here's what the game's about:<br/><br/>Central to the theme and premise of the game is that your characters start as basically blank slates, and you discover who they are through the process of play.  I want rules that encourage players to try on a persona for their character, play around with it, then throw it away and transform their character into something else.  At the same time, I want rules that encourage players to have their characters invest in the fantasy world, in the sense of seeing a conflict, making a decision that one side is right and the other is wrong, putting a stake in the ground and being willing to fight for it.  And then, later on, perhaps to change their mind and switch sides, as the complexity of the situation becomes more apparent and they think more about what their values are.  Eventually you help save, or help destroy, the fantasy world, and return to Earth, or not.<br/><br/>I'm hoping the process of transforming your character's identity, supported and encouraged by appropriate mechanics, will 1. emulate somewhat the process by which teenagers become adults, 2. be fertile ground for various thematic statements by players, and 3. be a lot of fun.<br/><br/>I'm thinking I want PCs to start with little more than a personal goal, some relationships, and a flaw/weakness/insecurity or two (the kind of thing that GURPS would call a "mental disadvantage").  The personal goal is something related to the high-school world that you want, but your insecurities are preventing you from achieving it.  (Simple example:  I want a girlfriend, but I'm super awkward around girls.  Better example: I want to earn parental approval by getting into a good college, but I go out of my way to piss off my teachers cuz I have a problem with authority figures.)  Playing out your weaknesses, eventually overcoming them ("buying off the disadvantage" as it were), or else accepting them as part of your personality that you're OK with, would be a major part of the game.<br/>At the end of the story, when you've returned to the real world (or not) and get some sort of epilogue for dealing with your original goal.  For example, is it easily achievable thanks to your newfound maturity and moral fiber?  Or have you abandoned it completely as something childish you're no longer interested in?  Or have you decided that the people you met in the fantasy world were so much more important to you than your original goal that you choose never to return at all?<br/><br/>(I'm thinking that maybe the strength of your connection back to your high-school world vs. the strength of your connection to the fantasy realm is important enough that it may benefit from specific mechanical reinforcement of some kind of trade-off.  Sacrifice your memories of your homeworld in order to get your wishes granted, a la Bastian in the second half of The Neverending Story?)<br/><br/>(continued...)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146806/#Comment_146806" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T02:37:53+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  2:37AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've also got an idea that each player rolls up a "report card" for their charcter with grades in various subjects, which serve as an aid to brainstorming the character's personality and also provide some meager academic skills to start with, which will be intentionally ill-suited to the fantasy world, though still usable.  ("I have an A in Music, so I'm gonna try to charm the Queen with this song we've been practicing for the graduation ceremony...") This idea might be overly cute and I'm willing to drop it if it doesn't fit in with the rest of the game.  The idea of grades in specific subjects sort of naturally suggests a skills-based task-resolution system, which is probably not what I want.  On the other hand, it could be made to fit into a generalized Trait-based kind of conflict-resolution system, where traits relevant to the conflict at hand give you different amounts/types of dice like in Dogs, and it's simply a rule that skills from your Report Card are a smaller size of dice, and therefore ultimately less significant than, the size of dice you get for things like character goals and relationships and other things that are more personally meaningful like that.<br/><br/>I also have to decide: if Math and Social Studies are specifically recognized by the game as numerical attributes that all players have, then is there an exhaustive list of other, fantasy-world-appropriate skills that can be learned by characters after spending some time there, like Horseback Riding or what have you?  Thing is, I'm hoping this game can use collaborative setting-creation techniques for the fantasy world, and therefore no one skill list will cover it, and I'm not particularly interested in making one anyway.  So I think I'm really leaning towards the generalized Traits sort of thing.<br/><br/>Really important part that I haven't gotten to yet: virtues and character classes.  This being a fantasy world, it has an absolute moral compass, in that righteous behavior gives you mythic power.  I'm thinking that traditional fantasy Character Classes, or some kind of mix-matchable ability sets, like "healer", "knight", "mage who blows stuff up", etc. etc. can be earned by the characters once they enter the fantasy world, and that each character class has some associated virtues (an idea used to good effect in, for example, Ultima IV).  That is, every character would have scores in things like "Bravery", "Honesty", "Compassion", etc. etc. All scores would start at zero -- your high schoolers are blank slates, remember -- and go up and down in response to how you play your character.  Perform some courageous deeds, your Bravery goes up, the Knight class opens up, you can claim it and then have Useful Abilities.  With me so far?<br/><br/>Now, remember I said that part of growing up in this game is about trying out different identities.  The character classes, being archetypal identities, are an expression of that idea.  So it should be really easy for your character to use a class for a while, but then choose to emphasize a different virtue, and switch to a different class.  Mechanically, class-switching should be easily done and encouraged rather than punished.<br/><br/><br/>Subtle design points here: rather than a specific Bravery score being required to become a Knight, maybe it's that the Knight abilities are like "gain a number of bonus dice equal to your bravery whenever you put yourself in harm to protect someone else", or whatever.  So that anyone can pick up the Knight class at any time, but it doesn't *do* anything unless you have a positive Bravery score.  I guess this depends on what you need to do *in the fiction* to change character class, which I haven't thought about yet.  It's also related to the question of "do I gain bonus dice based on my virtues in the absence of a character class ability that says I do?".  I'm thinking the answer is "no" -- the character classes are more interesting if they are the one and only way to translate virtue scores into effectiveness.  Finally, I'm thinking that if there are all these character classes with various powers, I'm going to need to have a certain amount of mechanical complexity in the resolution system, so that classes can be differentiated from each other mechanically, with abilities that do mechanically different things.  In other words, a resolution system like Primetime Adventures where you resolve the whole scene's conflict in one go wouldn't be appropriate for this game, since it would give character class abilities nothing to latch on to.<br/><br/>(continued...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146807/#Comment_146807" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T02:40:02+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  2:40AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So now we've got your goals, your insecurities, your report-card grades, and potentially your relationships (haven't thought much about those) and your character-class abilities all as input to the resolution system.  We have virtue score changes as a reward mechanic that plays into classes and therefore into effectiveness.  (I'm pretty sure that virtue score changes depend entirely on the contents of your role-playing and not on any other mechanic. I.E. the game rules couldn't tell you when you had forfeited a point of Honesty; only the GM, or another player, analyzing your character's behavior, could tell you that.)  There probably also needs to be some kind of fortune-in-the-middle mechanic where I can see that I'm unhappy with a die roll and pay out of some limited resource, or risk some penalty, or escalate the conflict stakes, or whatever, in order to get myself a re-roll or whatever.<br/><br/>Now, at this point, I'm not quite happy with how this is shaping up, because the virtues are too one-sided.  It's a bit boring, both game-wise and fiction-wise, if the rules always encourage you to play to increase your virtues.  I.E. high Compassion helps you be a better healer, healing people shows compassion, self-reinforcing cycle, you are rewarded for a one-dimensional character who simply demonstrates more and more compassion over time and nothing else.<br/><br/>The GM could counteract this tendency by specifically introducing choices that pit one virtue against another, where to gain in one is to lose in the other, but there's only so much you can do with that before it feels contrived.  So I'm thinking the game should also provide some mechanical temptation to go down in virtue scales.  My first idea is that if you behaved in an evil way, contrary to a virtue, you could get a spectacular bunch of bonus dice for that one action, but lose a point of the virtue permanently.  You'd be trading long-term for short-term effectiveness.  ("Evil is shortsighted"?)<br/><br/>But maybe a better idea is that the *opposite* of virtues are... also virtues.  For instance, if the opposite of Honesty is Cunning, such that decreasing Honesty below zero results in a positive Cunning score, then there could be a whole selection of Evil Character Classes that draw from the evil sides of the virtues.  The Cunning character could earn classes like Thief or Asassin.  Now, see, that strikes me as pretty cool, especially if it's a Significant Thing in the fiction to be an evil class -- maybe the Evil Empire that's threatening the fantasy world comes along and offers your character his or her greatest desire in exchange for serving them.  Encourage people to go to the darkside, the way Edmund does (temporarily) in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  This makes for a lot of cool story possibilities: betrayal, redemption, split loyalties, etc etc.  The coming-of-age story strikes me as more true, with a bigger range of dramatic statements, if some of the teenagers spend some time being evil and tearing up the fantasy world and putting peaceful woodland creatures to the sword in exchange for cool powers, and then maybe come to regret their actions and reform... or maybe don't.<br/><br/>The "evil classes" idea probably doesn't mesh so well with the "evil is shortsighted" bonus dice idea, so we might have to throw out the former, even though I like its simplicity.<br/><br/>(continued...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146808/#Comment_146808" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T02:40:14+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  2:40AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A final possibility is that each Virtue is not so much Good vs. Evil as it is two opposing points of view, either of which is potentially valid.  This immediately changes the feel of the fantasy world from epic Manichean to ambiguous shades-of-gray.  This might be more appropriate for a game about teenagers, since challenging conventional morality is a pretty important part of growing through that teenage stage.  Especially in a world without your parents or teachers, it's going to be all about defining your own morality, seeing what results that leads to, then reconsidering and perhaps changing the principles you're choosing to live by.  A more ambiguous set of values might work better for such a game, although it's at risk of losing some of that high-fantasy frission.  (instead of "Oh no! He's gone over to the Dark Side!" it becomes "Oh no! He's gone over to the Cynical Side!".  Doesn't have the same ring.)<br/><br/>But in that vein, here's some potential virtue scales where the left side is a sort of classical fairy-tale virtue, and the right side is a rebellion against it which might be considered as a virtue in its own right, though a more antiheroic one.<br/><br/>Honesty &lt;- 0 -&gt; Cunning<br/>Bravery &lt;- 0 -&gt; Discretion<br/>Peace &lt;- 0 -&gt; Violence<br/>Cooperation &lt;- 0 -&gt; Individualism<br/>Mercy &lt;- 0 -&gt; Judgement<br/>Purity &lt;- 0 -&gt; Curiosity<br/><br/>The prevailing "good" culture of the fantasy world might *define* the quality on the right side as Evil, but it's not objectively evil, which might make it a more appealing choice for a player character.  In this type of world, the game is less about the difficulty of walking the straight+narrow path, and more about choosing which of the opposing sides on an issue appeals to your character more.<br/><br/>There probably still needs to be something in the mechanics that pushes you back towards the center of those scales, where you have the opportunity to rethink your values and change Character Classes.  It needs that in order to counteract the tendency to just get more and more extreme in one particular direction to get more powerful with a single class.  So I'm back to the idea that you can wager points from your virtues as a positioning mechanism, i.e. "I rolled lousy, I'll risk a point of Cunning to re-roll that..." and it works the same whether you're on the positive or negative side of the scale, i.e. if you lose it you move one step closer to zero.  But what the heck does that represent in the fiction?  I think I just counteracted the idea that changes in your virtue scales should only come from role-playing.<br/><br/>Bah!  This is hard.  And I'm no closer to figuring out a dice mechanic that does all the things I want.<br/><br/>Sorry for the super-long first post.  Thanks for reading, and let me know if you have any ideas.

I hoped you'd make it this year, but it's likely a difficult bike ride to get to Madison. You playtested my most horrible version of Silence Keeps Me A Victim. Anyway just wanted to reacquaint myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds to me that the problem you are having is that your goals are conflicted. You're saying you want the players to find out who they are, but also to have these really solid high school identities. You want them to choose a side, which requires a grayness, otherwise there wouldn't be drama inherit in the choosing, but you want all these traits that determine whether the character is evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I find interesting in a coming of age story is someone who doesn't know themselves, like say Ruuji from Zoids: Genesis, who through the process of the story finds out who they are, and makes ethical choices. In these stories their choices aren't really ever wrong, as I think the choices are tangential to children figuring out who they are. Maybe I'm wrong there. Anyway... what I'm more interested in, is knowing what your interest in these stories is so I can better understand what you are looking for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146819/#Comment_146819" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T03:49:32+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  3:49AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What sort of mechanical systems do you like?

We played a game called EPICS a few years ago that was a "define your character through play" system. What I learned from the experience was that with sketchy characters, players go into the game with specific ideas for their development, and that as GM, if you give adversity that doesn't match what they need for defining their character the way they want to, they'll ignore it. If they don't ignore it, then it's just because they're being a good sport, and the result will be that their character doesn't develop how they were hoping, and they lose interest in the game over time.<br/><br/>2. I don't think identity formation is about trying on classes. Perhaps this is more for the 11-13 yr old age range, but I think identity formation is about adopting role models and trying out their identities. "When my brother talks to adults, people listen." And then I adopt the body language and demeanor of my brother as best I can, and see if I can't get people to listen to me. If I fail, perhaps more than once, then I'm defined as someone who people don't listen to. Perhaps this creates insecurities.<br/><br/>3. So, if I were designing it, I'd do something with trait definition via the adoption of role models like that, and then I'd introduce colorful NPCs into the mix. "Prince Guaifenesin was glorious in battle against the witch king." And then we see how well I manage to achieve success in battle.<br/><br/>4. The high school age range is less honest, in my mind, more about image creation than identity formation, more about creating image to cover up enduring insecurities than about identity. I think the 11-13 age range works better for Narnia, etc.<br/><br/>5. So, conceptually, I'd have Identity defined by a character's efforts to adopt traits via choosing of role models. That is, Identity would be sourced externally to the character. Insecurities, however, would be directly associated with the character. And then there would be Things I Must Do. "You, are the chosen one. You must retrieve the crystal sword from the caves of flesh eaters and use it to slay the behemoth." "You must bring the rival kings together for the conclave or the fae will be so offended as to withhold their magic from the realm for a thousand years." "You must pass Algebra or you can't be a cheerleader." The Things I Must Do would be oppposed to the Insecurities in some powerful way, so the game becomes about navigating both of them by choosing role models, adopting traits, and defining an identity.<br/><br/>6. So, I think it would resolve the problem we had with EPICS, because letting the player define some component of Insecurities and/or Things I Must Do will give the GM what he needs for creating adversity and still put the players in the position of defining their characters through play.<br/><br/>Paul                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147205/#Comment_147205" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T23:10:12+00:00" title="June  1, 2008 11:10PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your feedback so far, guys.  It's taken me a while to compose a response both because I had a busy weekend, and because you raised some questions that needed some serious thought.<br/><br/>Clyde: Good to talk to you again!  Actually, I didn't go to Forge Midwest this year because I moved to California.  (I know, I know... what a silly thing to do!)  I remember Silence Keeps Me A Victim and I'm glad to see you're still working on it.  I see you have a thread about it; I hope I can contribute something useful over there.<br/><br/>You're absolutely right that my goals are conflicted.  I just have to figure out, when two ideas conflict, which one belongs in this game and which one I should save for another design.<br/><br/>You asked:\n<blockquote>Anyway... what I'm more interested in, is knowing what your interest in these stories is so I can better understand what you are looking for?</blockquote>\nThat's a really good question. I can tell you they're my favorite fantasy sub-genre, without being able to articulate exactly why.  Part of it is that culture shock is interesting to me, therefore fish-out-of-water stories are interesting, and confronting fantasy tropes from the viewpoint of a citizen of the modern world especially so because of the contrasting expectations.  Part of it is that the protagonist comes from a situation familiar to the audience, has a level of knowledge of the world equivalent to that of the audience (zero) and therefore serves as a viewpoint character who is really easy to identify with.<br/><br/>But the biggest part of it gets right down into the deep magic of why humans tell fantasy stories at all.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I feel like it has something to do with connecting the epic/mythological to the personal.  This kind of connection is present in different ways in different genres; for example, think about superhero stories, where the hero exists (as his secret identiy) in the world of mundane, personal problems which the viewer can relate to, but also (as his hero identity) embodies a mythic archetype locked in an epic struggle.  Quest-style fantasy is about taking a journey starting from the mundane/personal world (e.g. The Shire) into an epic, mythological world where actions like throwing a ring into the lava have cosmic repercussions.  Etc.  <br/><br/>And back to the genre in question: look at Labyrinth (the bestest movie ever!!) where Sarah's personal issues (I hate my brother! Also I whine about things being unfair because I refuse to take responsibility for anything I do!) sorta flow into the world of the labyrinth, and then what happens in the labyrinth flows back into her personal issues (realizing the goblin king has no power over her, etc).<br/><br/>So that's what I like about these kind of stories.  And so I want to play a game where I can explore that connection: how do the choices I make in this mythological space flow back into my personal life and affect what sort of person I grow up to be?  There's lots of fantasy RPGs, but I've never seen one designed specifically to address this particular sub-genre.<br/><br/>I've also wanted, for a while, to do a treatment of the fantasy-character-class idea where, instead of just picking one to play, you have to earn your way into them.  i.e. to take on the power of a mythic archetype (the barbarian, the necromancer, whatever) you first have to act in accordance with the values associated with that archetype (prove your cunning before you can become the Thief, etc.)  In other words, a character's fantasy-world effectiveness is a symbolic function of behavior and moral chioces, which I <i>think</i> fits in well with the other stuff I want to do in this game.  But I could be wrong; this might be an idea that I'm better off shelving for a different game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147206/#Comment_147206" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T23:10:21+00:00" title="June  1, 2008 11:10PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2008 11:11PM by Jono.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clyde: hopefully that explains where I'm coming from, and now that I have that clear in my own head (thanks!) maybe it will be easier to resolve some design dilemmas.<br/><br/>You said: \n<blockquote>You're saying you want the players to find out who they are, but also to have these really solid high school identities.</blockquote>\nOf the two, "find out who they are" is more important, so let's say that we can let the high school identities remain sketchy.  The character creation process should be minimalist, and there should be maybe one short intro scene played out for each character in the high school world -- just enough to let you start feeling out your character -- before the magic happens and you all go to Oz.\n<blockquote>You want them to choose a side, which requires a grayness, otherwise there wouldn't be drama inherit in the choosing, but you want all these traits that determine whether the character is evil.</blockquote>\nWell, I was thinking that whether the character is evil determines the traits, not the other way around.  But you're right that there's more drama inherent in the choosing when it's shades of grey.   The more I think about it, the more I think telling players what's good and what's evil would clog up "the fruitful void".  My goal is not to tell to be C.S.Lewis and impart Important Moral Teachings Through Allegory.  (Yuck.)  That helps me decide that the virtue scales should be like the ones I described in post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> above -- not so much a "good vs evil" choice but rather a "conformity vs rebellion" or "conviction vs compromise" kind of choice.   Or a choice between which of two warring factions to join, when neither one is completely clean.\n<blockquote><br/>What I find interesting in a coming of age story is someone who doesn't know themselves, like say Ruuji from Zoids: Genesis, who through the process of the story finds out who they are, and makes ethical choices. In these stories their choices aren't really ever wrong, as I think the choices are tangential to children figuring out who they are.</blockquote>\nYes!  Exactly.

What gets closest to the feeling that you want to evoke from this game? Do you want to be resolving tasks, or scenes, or conflicts, or goals?</blockquote>\nHmmmm, good questions.  I would say that I wanted to resolve conflicts, but after reading the thread about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6563" rel="nofollow">The Slippery Slope of Stakes</a> I'm not so sure I even know what conflict resolution means anymore.<br/><br/>I like fortune-in-the-middle; I like systems where a player can say "This action right here is so important to me that I'm going to burn some limited resource in order to give it a better chance to succeed."  I like systems where you chuck down some dice and then realize that you didn't roll well enough to get all the things you wanted, so you might have to make a sudden decision about what the most important thing is, and sacrifice the rest.<br/><br/>I don't want to resolve a whole scene at once, because I like it when there's some back-and-forth first, with players escalating and narrating increasingly crazy or extreme actions and not knowing how it's going to turn out until the very end.   I like how escalation mechanics can be a cattle prod to the creative part of the brain ("I gotta think of something to top <i>that?!?</i>").  I like systems where certain things on a character sheet can only be used once per scene or once per encounter or whatever, because that prods me into getting creative to find ways to use everything on my sheet that I haven't used yet.<br/><br/>Also, I don't like the conflict resolution to be totally abstract to the point where you could play it as a standalone dice game without reference to the fiction at all.  Sometimes it seems like indie designs skirt close to that edge.  I prefer the actions in the fiction to determine what you get to roll, the outcome of the roll to determine a change in the fiction, and the change in the fiction to determine what the next valid range of actions could be.  At the same time, I hate having to pause play to look stuff up, so I want it simple/generic enough to be able to handle any situation without reference to specific charts and tables of modifiers or whatever.<br/><br/>(Yeah, I know, I'm greedy.  I want it all.)<br/><br/>What's closest to the feeling I want to evoke from this game?  Hmmm.  I guess I want, primarily, a feeling of fun and adventure, where you get to use cool powers and pull off cool stunts and be heroic and all that, but with an undercurrent of "your choices have serious repercussions", such that dilemmas are frequently coming up in play ("Here's your best friend, who has become a Black Knight and joined the Evil Empire's side.  He's challenging you to a duel.  What are you gonna do?" -- OK, not the most original example, but you get the idea) and what you choose has serious implications not only for the resolution of the situation but also on your character's long-term development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147209/#Comment_147209" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T23:50:51+00:00" title="June  1, 2008 11:50PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul!<br/><br/>Thanks for your comments.

It might fit the criteria of answering the age old Indie challenge of, "What is your game about?" The idea I think being that personal game design may work better the opposite of programing. In my imagination of programming you try to figure out the whole, and then create it by making the pieces. Trial and Error points out the way. I think it may be helpful to do it the other way for Game Design, but really-- what do I know? If I were trying to design the game you are discussing thinking about how to do the bold text might be where I would start. I'm not, however I have in the past shot for something similiar, but that was a stepping stone to silence which explains why it got dropped. I am a fan of what you are shooting for.

This would let players define how they want the character to grow, and would also define how they see the people. For instance do I borrow Aslan's courage, wisdom, or fighting prowess. Whichever I choose is likely making a statement about where I want to go with the character.

I think if you look too hard at classic "Indie" design using flags and the game master using them to build off of to make the character you may have something that is a bit too "set" in place. You seem to be expressing a desire to play a game where discovery is a strong portion of the desired play. I think the kind of gaming where the player has flags and the gm tags them, thrives with players who are going to push. Push requires objectives, at least on part of the players. Yes, there will be surprises and growth, but I'm arguing that it is likely to be less about discovery than something that uses... something-- else. <br><br>If that statement raises some kind of dander, please start a new thread and point me at it?

Jono is free to listen and disregard what I'm saying. <br><br>Anyway... I think this "something else" is one of the things I'm trying to grab onto with my design as there are no flags of any kind.

Maybe this would be a good starting point that would enable me to get to the point of a first playtest relatively soon.  Has anybody here had experiences with developing stuff on top of FATE?

As long as you get one plus out of your fistfull of Fudge dice, you can succeed on your mission, if you choose to put the plus into mission success.  But if the rest of the dice are crummy, then you're going to be taking a lot of pain to your relationships, pilot safety, and so on, and then you have to decide whether succeeding on the mission is worth all that.  In play, it's always very tense.<br/><br/>"You succeed.  Roll dice to decide how much it costs you." = boring.<br/>"Roll dice to decide how much it'll cost you.

The character creation process should be minimalist, and there should be maybe one short intro scene played out for each character in the high school world -- just enough to let you start feeling out your character -- before the magic happens and you all go to Oz.<br><br><br>I don't really see those two things at odds at all: the whole game seems like an exercise in morphing one character into another using action as a catalyst. I really think figuring out who you are as an adult happens around high school, and it involves this kind of change in character. Example: if you had asked me my political preferences as a high schooler, I would have told you I was a Republican. I was a Republican because my parents were Republicans; i.e. I was a Republican because I hadn't given the matter any thought. I also used to be an angsty little puke, too, but I grew out of it (mostly).<br/><br/>So I think a game that involves a character's first real reevaluation of themselves would be awesome. I think the more arbitrary the initial "persona," the better. But, it has to be something that the player should always be thinking when making decisions for their character. This is pretty much what you have planned, it seems.<br/><br/>As for mechanics: <br/><br/>One idea I had was that there could be a midway point early on in the game where players have made enough decisions that they get to have some kind of power granted to them by their Magic Friends that gives them an initial role in the fantasy world. (In the CS Lewis, this is the Santa Claus scene; there's a stage like this in the Hero Cycle.) This gives players good motivation to figure out some kind of direction. The rest of the game can be the characters figuring out if that role suits them (the traitor could come back to the group, the leader could realize that it's just not his bag, etc.) and provide some structure to the game. This is also a time for the GM to tell the players what he's thought of their actions so far.<br/><br/>As for the dice, the way I see using Virtues as stats is that the GM will have to make a judgment call for each conflict as to which virtue is applicable and which side of the virtue applies. Perhaps they could pick a secondary as well. Then the user could roll X +/- Y number of fudge dice based on their score (Y) in a certain virtue. Then, after (or maybe even before) the character can choose to alter their virtue stat to get more dice. This change will have to cost something, but you can stop players from going crazy by applying some kind of price to this change. The catch is that this price is based on <i>acceleration</i>: if a player has a 5 in Violence, it'll cost them <i>x</i> number of whatever to bump that up to 6, but it'll cost them <i>4x</i> to knock it back down to 4. And maybe at 6, it'll cost <i>1/2x</i> to go up to 7. Whatever <i>x</i> is can be static or earned. Either way, the player will definitely have the temptation to really push a stat -- but also have the realization that the GM will definitely throw situations at them where that stat is a negative. But if they don't make any choices, they won't be able to get anywhere. And the acceleration will make sure that they don't play games and just adjust their scores to win every encounter.<br/><br/>Obviously, the implementation details can vary (fudge dice, actual numbers, etc) -- am I making the basic idea of it clear?<br/><br/>As for your "report card," I think that's a pretty good idea. I think it ought to act like Special Powers in The Mountain Witch do -- for color and giving each player an action-based niche, and have no effect on the mechanics. You may even want to let players pick two or three "extracurricular activities" that give them more interesting qualities.<br/><br/>These ideas might actually not work great together, but I'm just brainstormin here                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

I'll throw out the gist of it here, then develop it more later...<br/><br/>Skills, goals, relationships, virtues, and other traits all have a number and type of dice assigned to them.<br/>Skills are the weakest, so they use the smallest die size.  An A in Science might give you 4d6, but those are still merely d6, while relationships, goals, and earned virtues might use d8s and d10s.  Details to be worked out.<br/><br/>When a conflict starts, each side identifies what it's trying to do.  Each one of these becomes a "category".  It might be helpful to mark the categories on paper.  So, I'm trying to lead the giant away from the marketplace; the giant is trying to smoosh me.  We draw two circles on a piece of paper and label one "lead away" and the other "smoosh".<br/><br/>I roll in all the dice that are relevant to how I'm trying to do what I'm doing.  If it's relevant to my personal goal, I get those goal dice.  If I'm acting in accordance with a virtue in which I already have points, I get to roll in those dice too.  And so on.  What virtue, if any, my action corresponds to is preferably judged by a player without a stake in the conflict.  Stabbing the giant in the toe to get his attention might be Violence, while telling the giant that I know where he can find an entire buffalo to eat might be Honesty.  (With sufficient creativity, I can probably figure out a way to use just about any virtue for any conflict.  Encouraging creativity is good.)<br/><br/>My insecurities/mental flaws have dice too.  If I have an insecurity that's relevant to this conflict, I give those dice to the giant to roll against me.  (And I get an experience point or a reroll chip or some other bennie each time I get screwed like this.)<br/><br/>The dice all get rolled.  Each side chooses one of their dice to put into each of the circles on the paper.  (If it's player vs. NPC, the GM puts the dice out first, then the player.  If it's a PC vs PC conflict, each side chooses secretly, then all are revealed at once.  Maybe?)<br/><br/>Highest die in each category wins the category.  Someone narrates what happened to get us to this point.  (Highest individual die gets the narration?  Or perhaps the narration rights are a third, implicit category which always exists?)<br/><br/>The conflict isn't over yet.  Whoever is not happy with the results as they stand can start a follow-up conflict by narrating whatever they're doing next, to get more dice.  The GM can spend chips out of some kind of "threat pool" to introduce new threats or complications into the scene, which give the GM more dice and/or introduce new categories under threat.<br/><br/>A player doesn't have threat chips, but can allow a new category to be threatened in order to roll in another trait which hasn't yet been used in this scene.  For instance, if I have a relationship with Sue The Giant Intelligent Eagle that I haven't yet used in this scene, I can narrate how Sue is helping me, get the dice for that relationship, but I have to introduce a new "Sue gets hurt" threat category, to which each side assigns a die.<br/><br/>All dice already rolled stand as they are.  If I'm currently losing in one category, but in my new roll I get a die high enough to beat my opponent's die, I can swap the new die in there and discard the old one.<br/><br/>I can't roll in a trait which I've already rolled in this scene.  Say Peace &lt;- -&gt; Violence is one of the scales, and I've already used Violence:  I can't get more dice by comitting more violence.  I have to think of something different to try.  I am allowed to use the opposite of a trait that I've already used, so I can try to use Peace: I get a bunch of dice, but in so doing I've sacrificed one of my points of Violence.  Maybe I get one die, of the highest die size, for each point that I previously had in Violence.  (So the more I was invested in using any one virtue to solve problems, the more of a reward I get if I reconsider that investment and give up some of my power to try the opposite approach.)  It would work in exactly the same way if I was going the other direction, from peace to violence.  This option would always be available as a kind of last resort; it's a small character-transformation moment each time it happens.<br/><br/>The process of adding new threatened categories and rolling in new dice can go back and forth several times, until both sides accept the result as it stands.  The owner of the highest die in each category decides what the resolution of that category is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148947/#Comment_148947" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T00:17:36+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 12:17AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I used a virtue well, and didn't sell it out to use the opposite for the extra dice, I can gain a point of that virtue as a reward at the end of the scene,<br/><br/>Special abilities granted by character classes can, in addition to granting extra dice in special situations where they're relevant, can also mess with the above rule system in various ways.<br/><br/>This is all still pretty sketchy and there are almost definitely several things wrong with it, but I feel like it's a good start.

You could maybe do the same by saying you can lose dice in things by rolling 1's (or whatever) when you risk them. So I can use my Giant Eagle relationship dice to help me out, but bad rolls can make the eagle or the relationship suffer because I risked it, and if I don't like that I can sacrifice other successes to cancel those failures and so on.<br/><br/>But I am not so sure about the polar traits. If my goal is to find out who and what I am then surely I am aiming towards more polarised traits, so why reward me for vacilating back and forth between Peace and Violence?

So there's a strong long-term reward for picking one thing and sticking to it.  The reward for 'vacilating' is more dice right now when you desperately need them, at the cost of weakening yourself long term -- since your virtue goes down you'll have less dice next time.  My aim was to make both choices rewarding mechanically, but in different ways, so that there's always this interesting decision to make.  At least, that's my theory; I'd have to see how it worked out in practice.\n<blockquote>You could maybe do the same by saying you can lose dice in things by rolling 1's (or whatever) when you risk them.</blockquote>\nIntriguing!  Yeah, I should try something like that.<br/><br/>There should also be a way that I can gain new insecurities (or strengthen existing ones) as a fallout from conflict.  Maybe this is just one of the many kinds of threats the GM can introduce to a scene by spending threat tokens:  say my Very Shy character is in a diplomatic negotiation scene.  The GM can maybe say "The risk is that the negotiations stress you out and you become even more afraid of saying the wrong thing..." and draw another circle on the paper, labeled "afraid of saying the wrong thing".  If the GM has the highest die in that category at the end of the scene, my Very Shy trait gets another die.  (Maybe if I have the highest die in that category, I can instead say that I gain confidence from the experience, and reduce my Very Shy trait by one die...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149009/#Comment_149009" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T10:24:21+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 10:24AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jono,<br/>Yeah, I think you're on to something there.<br/><br/>I'm also not sure about the polarized traits.  To return to <i>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</i> as an example, Peace and Violence were both necessities, and neither were necessarily good.  I mean, Narnia was <b>at peace</b> while Jadis ruled, but it wasn't a good peace.  Violence was also the only way to deal with Jadis, especially violence directed <b>at her</b>, because it meant that fewer Narnians had to be killed--because, on both sides of the war, the soldiers were all Narnians.<br/><br/>One of my favorite things about Otherkind is that every resolution might end with someone dying, possibly even an innocent bystander.  So, what if one of your categories was used to determine if a particular matter could be resolved in a Peaceful or Violent manner?  It's still all about the player's decisions, but without trait-dice backing up the conflicting modes, the player gets to make the decision purely on an ethical/thematic basis, without worrying about being hobbled for choosing the one with lesser dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
