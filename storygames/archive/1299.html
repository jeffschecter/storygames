                    I'm inspired by a side discussion in the Discussing Once You Go Indie thread, to ask those of you who have direct experience to share how the business of a FLGS functions.<br/><br/>Basically, I had the idea of calling game stores directly and asking them to carry printed copies of a game, and realized that I myself know just enough about three-tier distribution and its friends to know that I have no idea how that conversation goes.  Having done a little bit of unrelated entrepreneurial enterprise, I know it's important to have an idea about how your customers and partners function, so that you can present them with propositions that are attractive.<br/><br/>But rather than lay out why certain ideas do or don't work (or please do, but as examples), I'd love to hear about how the businesses function, from a financial and commitment basis, so that us crafty hippies can figure out how to turn them to the cause.                </div>

                            (Oops. I wrote the post below and then found out it wasn't exactly what you asked for. Well, perhaps it'll be useful anyway, for you or someone else).<br/>
<br/>
I used to run a gaming &amp; comics store some ten years ago in Norway. I don't think they operate very differently in the U. S. - but I could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
We used to order only from major distributors, to save on shipping costs, handling time etc. We had one contact person at each distributor. We weren't approached by any independent publishers; if we had been, we would most certainly have considered selling their games - if they were A) novelty items, or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> of obvious quality.<br/>
<br/>
Approaches that would have worked with us:<br/>
<br/>
- Coming by the store and showing us some games.<br/>
- Leaving a copy of a game for us to look at.<br/>
- Stating the key points that make the game different - and making sure they're really _different_.<br/>
- Being ready to answer questions concisely.<br/>
- Being a nice and cool person.<br/>
- Offering to run an in-store demo for customers at a later date. (Good promotion for the store).<br/>
<br/>
Approaches that wouldn't:<br/>
<br/>
- Insisting that we make an instant decision.<br/>
- Trying a hard sell. (Shopkeepers sell stuff for a living; attempts at manipulation will piss them off).<br/>
- Asking for an hour of our time to show us how the game works.<br/>
- Talking way too much about the product. (Shopkeepers have to hear people ranting about games all day).<br/>
- Being pushy, a fake, or bothering the customers in any way.                        </div>

                            Chris, JasonD:  Double what JasonM is saying.  <br><br>I'll put this in hard, cold context:  Within the next month, I intend to go out to my two local game stores and make an effort to strike up a relationship with them.  After all, I've got all this mad convention experience at demoing Indie games.  Best case scenario for me:  They stock the games, and I come in at infrequent intervals to run demonstrations for a few hours, then to run a full session (by signup) of one or another of the games, all in the interest of drumming up interest and excitement (and, of course, playing some rockin' games!)<br><br>I am very nervous about making the approach.  I feel as if I'm flying blind, not knowing how to even get in touch with the person who would make such decisions.  I fear going to the store, toodling around the racks, being unable to nerve myself to make the contact, and bailing.  That would <b>suck</b>.  Giving me information that would help me make an approach that game-store-folk would actually <i>appreciate</i> rather than merely tolerate (or not) would go a long way toward helping me feel good about doing this.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            What I did recently, since moving to Vancouver:<br><br>Walked into an independantly-owned store (I don't think this would work with chain stores). Found out who was in charge of the RPG stuff. Handed him a copy of Perfect, talked about it, talked about the Vancouver Gaming Guild.<br><br>He discussed possibly buying a small "trial stock" at 40% off sticker price.<br>He also discussed selling by consignment and taking 30% of it.<br><br>He took a copy of it, and my number... and said he'd call me and talk more after reading it. Probably after the weekend.<br><br/>So... yeah.<br/>What seemed to work for me:<br/>-Approach a local, indepedant store.<br/>-Talk to them about your kickass game.<br/>-Hand them a copy and your number if they are interested in stocking a small amount.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Ok, here we go.  What Matthijs said is a pretty good guideline for what would work to get me to sell an indie game. It would also help if you frequented my shop and I knew your face.  I'm much more likely to listen to someone that looks familiar to me.  Also, if I've had a conversation with you in the past that didn't necessarily involve how awesome your character/campaign was even better.<br/><br/>That said, while I was an owner, I had accounts with both Key20 and IPR and we carried a selection of indie titles. Those that seemed interesting to me on their face and those that I heard good buzz about on the 'net.  From talking to other retailers, I was somewhat unsual in that respect.<br/><br/>Many retailers that I've spoken too aren't interested in carrying a game unless they've got customers asking for it, or the creator is local.<br/><br/>Now, in my experience, carrying indie games is a lot of extra legwork. Carrying most games involved a call or email to my distributor and a couple days later I would have product.  For indie games, I had to make several more calls or emails and generally it took me longer to get product.  IPR and Key20 both helped with that when games were available through them.<br/><br/>I'm going to stop babbling now.  <br/><br/>Are there any specific questions?                        </div>

                            Getting products from any source other than your standard, major distributor is a pain in the ass. You have to spend time &amp; thought on the process, and the payoff will be minimal. If you usually spend three hours each week ordering stock, spending an additional hour just to make 10-20 bucks isn't worth it.<br/>
<br/>
So you should make the process of buying/ordering your game extremely easy - pop by the store to check if they still have your game in stock; if not, ask if they want some more, and if they do, give it to them right then and there (along with an invoice). The first few times, give them a money-back guarantee: If the game takes up shelf space for a month, the store doesn't have to buy it from you. (I think Dave Sim had a deal something like this for Cerebus).<br/>
<br/>
Tony, demoing in a store is a good idea; make sure it involves _no_ extra hassle for the owner. Print your own posters, put up a "sign-up-here" list with your contact info. The ideal deal for the store is that all they have to do is say OK, and you make something cool happen in their store for their customers.<br/>
<br/>
Tip on contacting store personnel: Pop by once or twice and talk to people there, so you know who the RPG person is, who the manager is etc. Ask them about their RPG section. Then, when you're sure you're talking to the right person (someone who you've got a positive conversation with, and who has decision-making power or influence), ask if they're interested in selling your game.<br/>
<br/>
They want to know:<br/>
<br/>
- that you're sane<br/>
- that you've got a solid product<br/>
- and that it's no hassle for them to stock it.<br/>
<br/>
Don't do any of these:<br/>
<br/>
- Step up to the first person you see and ask if they'll sell your game.<br/>
- Bother sales people who are very busy with customers.<br/>
- Let a junior employee make a decision.                        </div>

I mean, yeah, that's solid advice ... but in my case, both of my "local" stores are about an hour of driving time away from me.  In opposite directions, of course.  I want to do this in a manner that doesn't resemble a drive-by, but I'm not sure I want it enough to sink eight to twelve hours of my life into two or three two-hour round trips to each of two stores.  &gt;sigh&lt;<br><br>Good advice which I may, due to my piss-poor circumstances, end up disobeying.                        </br></br></div>

                            Well, it's not the main thing. Just make sure you don't walk in bright-eyed, bushy-tailed and looking like an insurance salesman, and then start your pitch right away. Look around the store, check out what they have, talk to the people for a few sentences, then tell them what you're about.                        </div>

                            Hey y'all, <br>
<br>
Sorry for the slow reply. Yesterday ended up by being a family day, so I ran out of time. So better late than never, I suppose.  So here goes.<br>
<br>
Little background. EndGame has been stocking Story Games for about the past year. We have had great success with them, focused Mini-Cons around them, and done as much as we can to market them to our local customer base. Featuring them at our 3 local conventions this year seemed to really help. I have had to buy product from both IPR (who is a pleasure to work with), and directly from the authors. I do what I have to to get product. More on that later...<br>
	Slightly more background. EndGame is 4,200sq. feet. I have a 2,500 sq. ft. show room, and a 1,700sq. ft. play space. Managing both with just three full time employees takes a lot of time with the growth we are trying to achieve. I can safely say we have one of the strongest brands in the SF Bay area, and I think that is growing beyond those boundaries. How does any of that apply to you as a small publisher? Honestly, by the approach.<br>
<br>
In a pretty lame way, I was just trying to frame how busy my day is. I am in the shop for 10 hours a day, and I would say most of my day is filled at least a week in advance with all the promotions I am working on, events I am juggling..and then there is that whole pesky customers thing.  What helps me want to buy something from you as a potential vendor is respecting my time. I am not trying to be a drama queen here, I just really have my time booked out during the week, and may not have any for you if you just wander in to sell me something.   So my number 1 recommendation is call ahead, ask for the buyer handling (fill in the blank, in this case RPGS), and set up an appointment. Some game stores aren't run like mine, and that might not be necessary...but man will it come off well even if it isn't. I promise I will make time for you if you call ahead. <br>
<br>
Number 2, and this is where it may get harder for some of you. If I can get you through distribution (including IPR) I am more likely to order. Why? Because it's easy. I have $175,000 worth of stock in my store. I and my partners spend about 20 hours a week ordering and receiving goods. As hard as we try, we forget the "little" guys. We are human, and suck occasionally. All that said, if I meet with you, have a good impression, I always try harder if I need to go direct. As mentioned we still do it for some small press titles.<br>
<br>
Number 3 is where we come to terms. (Pun intended) In my specific geographic location, if I don't get at least 36% off something, I lose money on the transaction. This will vary widely around the US and rest of the world. I can only talk about my needs here. So, if you want to sell me your book for 30%, I am more than likely to give a pass. 40% I am getting used to, and will suck it up and buy...but many stores won't. They are used to getting 45-50%, and will turn you away unless they get it. Our fixed costs are just like yours, so there isn't a lot of wiggle room there. There  is one clever way around this, but it involves more work for both parties: Consignment. If you and the store owner can agree to just stock your product on his shelf, and have you get paid as they sell, you may be able to take a higher cut. You are assuming all the risk. That's on a case by case basis, and in truth, i don't personally do it. I just buy the product for 40-50% assume the risk, and begin throwing it in my wide net of marketing.<br>
<br/>
So, what are some of the benefits of going through all this work? Well, again, that depends on your local game store. I am 100% aware that there are a large and vast number of stores run by trogs who just expect the product to sell itself. They don't bother to learn what they are selling, don't spend any marketing dollars, well...you get the picture. In truth, there isn't a lot of benefit from that type of store other than getting eyes on your product. If you can partner with a store that  is actively working to sell your product, that's SO much better. Maybe you can offer to help them organize a small mini con (if they have play space). Offer to help them with the flyers, and to find the gms. Remember, YOU are more than likely the expert in this case. Help them, and they will help you.<br/>
<br/>
I know there is a segment of the community who feels that retail isn't necessary for success, and I am going to agree depending on expectations and needs for sales. At some point I will try and remember to post my sales per title here to give you an idea of the volume that can move through a retail store. If memory serves, i am pretty sure we have gone though about 30 copies of DiV, and that's with several droughts to supply.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have covered the basics. But I am sure I have missed a lot. Ask questions if this forced any. I will do my best to answer.<br/>

                            Having gone store-to-store in the past, I can say that for me it basically wasn't worth it. Two reasons:<br/><br/>1. Lots of effort on my part, and little to none on the part of the people at the store. The books often went right into the shelves with no time on the display racks.<br/>2. They want 50% of the cover price, which means my game is either priced too high for anyone to even consider, or I make about $1 per copy.<br/>3. Some of them just fucking scam you. Hey, Wizard's Tower in Nashua New Hampshire: Fuck you.<br/><br/>Even for those stores that were easier to work with, and who put my games on display rather than into a bookcase, (Modern Myths, Phoenix Games, thank you guys), it was more worth my time to spend an hour or two improving my online sales than driving around. I *never* made my printing costs back.<br/><br/>Point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> may be better these days with lower-cost printing. Point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> basically boil down to a store-by-store basis, and even really nice folks at good stores often just don't care. Why should they? Chris' points apply completely, and some people aren't as nice as he is, as competent, or as interested in promoting indie games.                        </div>

                            Hey all, <br/>
<br/>
Hope it helped. Here is some further data I threw together this am. Perhaps it can be used as ammunition when talking to the owner of any game store you might approach. Here are the sales figures from 9/12/05 - 9/12/06. <br/>
<br/>
Breaking the Ice: 6<br/>
Capes: 6<br/>
Code of Unaris: 7<br/>
Conspiracy of Shadows: 6<br/>
Dogs in the Vineyard: 28 (I can't keep it in stock, seriously)<br/>
Mortal Coil: 8<br/>
Polaris: 20<br/>
PTA2e: 5<br/>
Shab-Al-Hiri Roach: 7<br/>
Mountain Witch: 19<br/>
Princes Kingdom: 3<br/>
Shadow of Yesterday: 5<br/>
With Great power: 8<br/>
Burning Empires: 6<br/>
Burning Wheel Revised: 28<br/>
Burning Wheel: Monster Burner 14<br/>
<br/>
I just don't have time to list every single title, but that should give your some ammunition as to the scope of sales in one year. Mind you, we go to great lengths to market our Mini-Cons, and we also have represented story type games at 3 "major" local shows, so our numbers are inflated there. If you wish to have any store owners contact me to strategize how they might get the games moving and off the ground, lemme know, and I will provide my contact info.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate all the nice comments you have thrown my way. In the end, since I am no writer I am happy to help the community in this small way, so thanks are not necessary. :)<br/>

                            I wanted to add to Chris P.'s comments that EndGame rocks.  I've just gotten back into the RPG scene in the past year, and EndGame is my first and last choice for playing and running games.  And the more time I spend there, the more (mostly indie RPG) product I buy from them.  So everyone is happy.<br/>
<br/>
Keep the minicons coming!!<br/>

                            This maybe a little late, hopefully this will be worthwhile: I'll post my experiences as a buyer of camping/climbing/paddlesport for a 22 store chain. Different industry, but retail is retail. And reps are reps. When selling your own product, you are basically a rep. What Chris Hanrahan posted above rings very true for me even though I sold different products. In addition, I've switched industries to photography and have to approach stores to sell my fine art prints, so I had to figure out what I liked as a buyer and practice that.<br/>
<br/>
Briefly, this is what I'd recommend for approaching a store:<br/>
<br/>
Initial Contact<br/>
<br/>
1. Call. Ask who the RPG buyer is?<br/>
2. If he or she is in, then ask to speak to him or her.<br/>
3. Briefly introduce yourself (quick) and ask him or her if they have time to set something up for you to come into the store and talk or offer to send some promotional materials. (Did I say quick!!! Try and keep this call under five minutes unless the buyer is lengthening the call.)<br/>
4. Offer to send a copy of the game or promotional materials. I always wanted to see promos, catalogues, price lists before I'd send my time meeting with someone.<br/>
5. Thank them for their time.<br/>
<br/>
Follow Up<br/>
1. Call a week later.<br/>
2. Ask if they received the promo.<br/>
3. Ask if they are interested in meeting.<br/>
4. Set up a brief meeting.<br/>
<br/>
In the Store<br/>
Before: Make a price list. Have terms, shipping costs, etc... all set before you get there. (Email, and I'll send you a copy of my Photography Wholesale Price Sheet for you to see if you want to see how I do it.)<br/>
1. Be early, but not too early. As a buyer I was always busy, but hated it when someone was waiting for me a long time, because they got there too early.<br/>
2. Introduce yourself and shake hands.<br/>
3. Be quick. Finish your presentation early. If you asked for an hour, finish in 40 minutes. If you asked for 30 minutes, finish in 20. If you asked for 20 minutes finish in 15.<br/>
4. Be nice. I liked laid back reps, but other buyers may vary.<br/>
5. Don't be pushy. As a buyer, I'd make my own decisions based on how I thought the product would sell for us. If I didn't think it would sell, then a pushy rep would leave a bad taste in my mouth for next years product line.<br/>
6. Take the extra time to either ask if they want to try a quick demo of the game if you have the right vibe.<br/>
7. Or take the extra time to learn about how their purchasing works, so you can accommodate the store better. A good question, "So, do you usually buy a product after meeting with a rep, or do you like to think about it and call in the order later?" Or something similar based on your comfort.<br/>
8. Take an order or give them a faxable order sheet.<br/>
9. Thank them for their time and leave before the time allotted is over.<br/>
<br/>
Smile!!!! Don't be afraid. From what I've read on the Internet here and at the Forge, you guys are really nice guys, and most buyers are nice guys to. Just try to get along and build a friendship and relationship. I liked the reps who built relationships with me, and even when I didn't think their product line would work, I'd give them a chance to convince me otherwise, and sometimes, based on that relationship, I'd try something new in one of the stores to see if it would work. Sometimes it did and sometimes it didn't, but those relationships often become fruitful in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<p>I just wanted to say thanks for this thread.</p>
<p>Also, without revealing more of Chris's business then he'll want me to, let me tell you designers that those numbers he posted are very good numbers for RPGs.  Speak of them with pride.</p>

<p>Hey, Chris --</p>
<p>If you want to share the figures that you shared with me (about mainstream RPG sales) that'd be awesome, but I'm not going to out your stuff, particularly because I don't trust my memory.</p>

                            Fair enough. Do you remember the titles we looked at when you were in the store? My brain is old, and forgets things like that...<br/>
<br/>
I will glance at compairisons at the store on Tuesday when I am there. Just lemme know what to look for.<br/>

<p>The titles I recall looking at were Mutants and Masterminds, True20, and World of Darkness + Vampire.</p>
<p>But any of them could work, I think.</p>
