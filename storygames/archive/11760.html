The venue for this is a d20 monster compendium, I suppose with the idea that the monsters would have way more awesome art than without using patronage.<br/><br/>So, I have kicked these guys $75 to run a little experiment of my own, because "\u2026patrons at this level can work with the game designers and the illustrator to create a unique, personalized NPC, monster, or templated monster. (Certain editorial controls enforced: Pun-Pun need not apply.) Our game designers will work with you to polish up your NPC or monster entry, ensure that it is balanced and ready to play, and help you choose a name for your creation. Your name will be listed in the credits in a place of honor as the designer of your own personal monster."<br/><br/>While I don't really care about being listed in the credits (I'd be willing to list "Story Games" or something as the credit if anyone wants that, otherwise I'd probably ask to be unlisted), I am curious to know this:<br/><br/><b>Is it possible, within the confines of the d20 system, to build a single monster entry that pulls players into a more "story games experience" (whatever you think that means), at least for that one encounter?</b><br/><br/>In other words, I'd like to come up with a monster idea for this "slot" in the book collaboratively, with the idea of elevating the notion of "monster description" into something that lends itself to memorable play.<br/><br/>Caveat: The content of this book will be Open Content, so if you want to participate in this concept, I'm going to make the assumption that you don't mind your ideas being released as such, unless you say otherwise.<br/><br/>I have no idea if this will work or not. But I figure it is worth $75 to try.<br/><br/>So, what makes a d20 monster cool? What makes a memorable creature? And what could be done with the creature's powers to help players take control of the narrative in some way when they meet it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262580/#Comment_262580" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T15:08:23+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  3:08PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do you mean by "take control of the narrative"?<br/><br/>Are we talking "take control" the way a game like Sorcerer means it?

Something that when it takes action "stirs up" the PCs and makes them take directed action.<br/><br/>Or are we talking "take control" the way a game like Houses of the Blooded means it where there is some mechanic that actually lets the players screw around with things external to their characters like back story elements?<br/><br/>If this is what you're talking about then I recommend building some kind of monster that induces oracular visions with instructions that each player gets to contribute one fact to the vision per point of Wisdom or something like that.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262582/#Comment_262582" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T15:13:47+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  3:13PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2010 3:14PM by Wordman.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I wrote it, I was thinking the latter, but either way should be considered.<br/><br/>I guess I'm thinking more from the notion of giving the players a taste of offering ideas to feed the story and seeing that lead to coolness, as this is something that some d20 players struggle with when trying to move to more narrative games (and, to some extent, I think that struggle "traps" gaming groups in d20 games forever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262591/#Comment_262591" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T15:52:13+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  3:52PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember monsters that generate intense situations much more than I remember monsters that simply look cool.

Something like that, and notes on a skill challenge for how to shape the fey's beliefs about what the "right kind of story" actually <i>is</i> might give the PCs an ability to indirectly influence the tropes and themes of the story they find themselves in.<br/><br/>It's a bit wonky because it's technically pulling the <i>characters</i> into a "story games experience" rather than the <i>players</i>... But for a d20 monster compendium, I think it's about as good as what you're gonna get, because anything else isn't going to be a monster so much as a house rule.<br/><br/>Actually, maybe give story-fey the ability to hear Out-of-Character chatter.

Seems to me that, to get the d20 gamers that have never even heard of other types of games, you need to expose them to the notion of player-controlled narrative on the sly, under camouflage from nice and comfortable standard d20 stat blocks.<br/><br/>Like I said, a better pitch from me at the start could have made this goal more clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264174/#Comment_264174" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-26T12:29:59+00:00" title="March 26, 2010 12:29PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry about "no whining" - a better way to say what I meant is "Come on, don't give up!" I think your project here is very, very worthy. There's a lot of 3.x system mastery out there that could be put to work playing story games, and this would be a great mechanical channel for it. I'd love to see this effort gain traction somehow; maybe you're right that the problem is that the pitch isn't catchy (see what I did there?) enough.<br/><br/>There was a thread, with a different aim, called "Story Games Monster Manual," and that did take off. I think that part of why it was successful is that it had a focus that called for less work to contribute - it was just looking for a list of "monsters" that occurred in story games. Maybe, beyond a more focused thread title, you ought to think about focusing the kind of contribution you're looking for.<br/><br/>So how about this: Say you're looking for monsters or powers for d20/3.x D&amp;D that bring story gaming techniques to that milieu. Give examples of the sense in which you mean "take control" - maybe say, sorry for the SGese, that the monster or power should democratically redistribute the GM-tasks during the encounter, if that's what you're looking for. And give a small example or starter - people love riffing, right? All of those things would lower the barrier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264185/#Comment_264185" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-26T13:33:15+00:00" title="March 26, 2010  1:33PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2010 1:33PM by Peter_Aronson.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A monster that is unkillable until someone fighting it accepts a quest from it.  The GM creates one quest for each character in the fight, based on their stats, class, race, level, backstory (if any) and a roll for theme.  Until one of the characters accept a quest, the monster takes no damage or effect from any attack or spell, but it can certainly dish it out.  The monster can not do lethal damage, however, until it has offered its quests.  Any character can accept any quest, regardless of which character it was made for.  The description of the quest should be no more than three lines in length.  Characters who accept quests have some sort of bonus in the fight; and if the game has that concept, they get some extra action/fate/hero/conviction points.  Characters who accept a quest are effectively geased (or the equivalent for their games) to perform the quest immediately upon completion of the battle.  If the monster is killed in the battle, then the geas is all but unbreakable, and the monster's ghost will haunt any defaulters.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quest Theme</span><ol>\n<li>Family</li>\n<li>History</li>\n<li>Passion</li>\n<li>Grief</li>\n<li>Divinity</li>\n<li>Guilt</li>\n<li>Innocence</li>\n<li>Rulership</li>\n</ol>\nThe monster almost certainly has various arcane senses, the ability to read minds, the ability to see a short distance into the future, and multiple mouths that can all speak at the same time and yet somehow all be understood.<br/><br/>OK, not terribly story-gamey, but it defeating the monster at least means accepting a story hook.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264190/#Comment_264190" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-26T15:01:21+00:00" title="March 26, 2010  3:01PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The creature eats its victims' memories.

Here's my try:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe monster is some sort of psychic beast. As an action, it searches the victim's memories for powerful foes it has fought in the past and summons them to join the battle on its side. This will invariably create an army of the PCs' previous enemies. You can try, as a defence, to empty your mind of all thought via a saving throw - but then the monster would just go on to read the mind of the next guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nA more effective strategy is, as a combat action, to concentrate your thoughts on one monster - scream its name and image in your head so the mind-reader has no choice but to summon it instead of whatever it was aiming for. This has to be something you've fought before in this campaign (let's not be picky about whether or not your current character has seen it), as only a monster fought with can provoke so strong a memory. Whether you succeed or not depends on some sort of a roll (10DR + WIS modifier?), with additional modifiers for monsters encountered during this adventures, monsters who inflicted some serious injury on the party or monsters encountered at seriously lower character levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the monster dies, so do its summoned minions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, I think, will introduce trad gamers to a small degree of narrative control through the lens of tactical combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265994/#Comment_265994" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T15:17:29+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  3:17PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2010 3:17PM by Wordman.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In an attempt to breathe some life into this, here are some random (not particularly great) ability writeups. These may not be entirely kosher d20 lingo, as I'm not that conversant with it. Chances are, all of these would <i>not</i> be abilities of a single creature; they are just food for general thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Fortune Shift</b> (Su): Notions of luck, fate and cause and effect behave strangely around {creature}. Anyone rolling a natural 1 on an attack roll against {creature} may treat the attack as successful, provided they describe some way in which the attack makes the situation for the attacker or his allies worse. Perhaps the backswing disturbed a hive of bees. Maybe a splash of blood from the attack gets in the eyes of the group's spellcaster. Or the attacker's bag of holding falls to the ground, disgorging an extra-dimensional creature. Or the {creature} recoils in pain, knocking the wagon of supplies over the edge of the cliff. Or anything else that makes the situation more complicated and interesting. The player of the attacker is encouraged to work with the the other players and the DM to come up with an idea; however, any player may veto the final idea, as may the DM. If the group cannot come up with an idea everyone can live with, the attack reverts to being a miss and the game continues.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Metawareness</b> (Ex): {creatures} possess a limited ability to see the destiny of those around them. This is represented by an ability to "hear" out-of-character table chatter made by the players of any characters a {creature} can see. For example, if a player says "next round, my character will move to give you a flanking bonus", the DM may play the {creature} as if it is totally aware of this plan. {Creatures} may also make use of information it can glean from such conversation. For example, if the player's talk among themselves about an NPC who is not present, {creature} may make reference to that NPC, usually as some sort of a taunt.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Meets Expectations</b> (Su): If any conversations overheard with the Metawareness ability make reference to suspected abilities of {creature}, the {creature} may develop just that ability for the next five minutes. For example, if one player says to another "this thing might have fire resistance", suddenly {creature} develops fire resistance. Abilities gained in this way should not exceed the rough capabilities of third level spells (i.e. chatter like "I hear this thing will grant you three wishes" have no effect).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Shared Nightmare Curse</b> (Su): Anyone struck by a {creature} must immediately make a DC 20 Will save or be afflicted by a <i>shared nightmare curse</i>. The effect of this curse remains hidden until the next time the target sleeps. At that time, all creatures afflicted by this curse within one mile share a nightmare. During the nightmare the dreamers may attempt to shape the collected dream to avoid the effects of the curse. Targets who choose to participate (as described below) gain a DC 15 Will save against the nightmare. Targets who fail (or do not make) this save suffer 1d4 points of Charisma loss upon waking. Making the save avoids this damage entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe horror of the shared nightmare comes from two sources. First, elements of the nightmare are drawn from the dark, secret corners of the participants minds, often giving life to their worst fears. Secondly, participants know that the the dream is shared between many people, and so risk exposing their inner selves and secrets to their fellow dreamers. Bystanders (those who are cursed but choose not to participate) avoid such exposure (but, as indicated above, automatically take the damage from the dream).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the participants is selected (either by player consent, randomly or by the DM) as the primary dreamer. The primary dreamer sets the theme and subject matter of the nightmare, drawing on the dark urges and secrets in the character's mind. They explain to the participants what the nightmare is trying to get them to expose. Participating characters explain how they appear to others in the nightmare. Ideally, participant's forms should express something about the theme the character would not want to share if given a choice. For example:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a nightmare about <i>weakness</i>, participants could appear in forms expressing the inadequacies they secretly harbor. A burly fighter type might show up as a student wearing a dunce cap, a signal that the fighter worries about not being smart enough, or perhaps as a child being berated by a father to whom he will never measure up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn nightmares about <i>fear</i>, participants are often themselves, confronted by what they fear most, or as if what they fear has already happened to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn nightmares about <i>desire</i>, participants reveal hidden, often dark, ambitions, appetites or yearnings.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all appearances are explained, each participant says how he tries to manipulate the dream in order to escape it, then makes their saving throw. Players who describe interacting with other characters in the dream gain a +2 on this roll. If the save succeeds, the character disappears from the dream immediately. If not, the player narrates what the failure looks like to the others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
