One thing I\u2019m particularly impressed with is that they seem to offer some of the benefits of collaborative GMless Story Games but in a more traditional play-style  context; for example, they let players contribute to the wider world and narrative without the pressure of being put on the spot and having to improv the story in a whole-cloth way, which some players find difficult or intimidating. <br/><br/>After finishing my collaborative Story Game, <b>House of Spiders</b>, I\u2019m going to design a RPG inspired by Game of Thrones. I\u2019m thinking of using a PbtA game structure for the design. <br/><br/>Besides reading and playing different PbtA game books, what are the absolute best resources to deeply understand the design structure of PbtA games?

Stuff like the players are thieves running around on rooftops or whatever. But what I quickly discovered was that I was at a serious loss for how to make the player experience the timing and precision inherent to the challenge of parkour.<br/><br/>"For example, in a lot of tabletop RPGs that resolve tasks you would resolve jumping over a pit by rolling high on some dice. But rolling a die doesn't feel like a challenge of timing and precision, and worse still you basically can't be good at rolling dice (and I want games where players can feel like they personally are being smart, clever, or skilled). So if my game revolves around the task-related challenges experienced by people doing parkour then it seems like that experience is not well conveyed with traditional task resolution systems like rolling dice.<br/><br/>"Do you have any ideas on approaches I might take to this problem?"<br/><br/>lumpley:<br/><br/>"I think it's Bernard Suits who says that the reason game design is hard is that the tools we have to work with are far removed from the experiences we want to give people. It's plain difficult to make someone feel like a boss at parkour when what you've got to work with is some notecards and 6-sided dice.<br/><br/>"I'd suggest looking to classic non-rpg games for inspiration. A lot of different standard dice games and card games blend luck and skill. Blackjack might be a good starting place for that kind of edge-pushing, for instance."<br/><br/>dindenver:<br/><br/>"One thing I tried to do when designing games to evoke a kind of feeling is looking back at other games I have played and trying to figure out when I felt that and what mechanics or GM-style or whatever was going on to make me feel that way.<br/><br/>"In one game, I wanted the players to feel tempted. I noodled around with the idea of a temptation mechanic and wondered if it would be better to use a stick, carrot or carrot and stick approach.<br/><br/>"I thought about it some more and realized that obtaining cyberware in CP2020 was the one time in an RPG where I felt tempted. The desire to be cool and get an edge on the NPCs tempted me to drain my humanity and bank account lower and lower.<br/><br/>"So, I built that sort of experience into my game."</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468965/#Comment_468965" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T02:29:53+00:00" title="January 16, 2018  2:29AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome everyone, I will check all of these out!

But then, I have very limited knowledge of GoT, so I might be completely deluded about what it's all about!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468995/#Comment_468995" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-17T15:22:02+00:00" title="January 17, 2018  3:22PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While there are a ton of PbtA games out there, very few do Game of Thrones. I think we've mentioned all the ones that do here by this point. (Having said that, there was a draft floating around at some point which was basically Apocalypse World + Strings from Monsterhearts, but it seems to have disappeared since then.)<br/><br/>The suggestion to look at Fallen Empires (which is literally just a fantasy Apocalypse World) and Sagas is interesting. Neither is at all right for Game of Thrones, but it's true that the desired gameplay would fall exactly between those two, if we were to place them on an imaginary continuum.<br/><br/>AW:Dark Ages is much more relevant (although in much opinion some things about that game are a mess).<br/><br/>However, there is one game coming out (soon?) which is exactly right, and Rafu's link reminded me of it:<br/><br/>"The Sword, the Crown, and the Unspeakable Power"<br/><br/>From what I've heard of it, it sounds both a) really promising, and b) exactly what we're talking about, a PbtA rpg aiming to do "Game of Thrones".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Raticle" title="Raticle"><img alt="Raticle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Raticle">Raticle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468999/#Comment_468999" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-17T18:45:43+00:00" title="January 17, 2018  6:45PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2018 6:52PM by Raticle.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is definitely an outlier systems-wise, but there's a PbtA rpg by Paul Riddle called Undying which seeks to emulate the brutal and political nature of vampires.

Your help<br/>is really appreciated. If anyone has anymore resources; especially, from video PbtA design talks or written essay, blog-type PbtA design advice, please keep them coming.<br/><br/>If anyone has some of their own general advice on how to handle a PbtA game that seeks to emulate the types of characters, plots, themes, tone, setting, etc. found in a Game of Thrones tv episode, I would love your advice. <br/><br/>There will be some Machiavellian elements and characters such as Little Finger and Cersei  type PCs, but there will also be some Jon Snow type PCs that focus on duty, adventure, and doing what is right, in a difficult world to do what is right. Of course, there will be Tyrion type PC role too; what would this type of game be without a Tyrion. The game needs to be able to handle all of these elements; as well, as all of the main character archetypes, plots and themes found in GoT. <i>It needs to be able to handle character vs. character situations and do a good job of it, so any advice on this front would be particularly helpful.</i> As the game developes, I\u2019m sure it will drift and become more original, but GoT is definitely the starting inspiration, and it will likely retain its GoT vibe more than other PbtA games on the market. <br/><br/>So any personal design advice, from those of you that have a good handle on the system, would be very appreciated. Again, thank you all for your help! You\u2019ve all been great! <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>P. S. I plan to get back to you all with more thorough responses, but my first studio critique of <b>House of Spiders</b> is due 2/1/18. The designer doing the critique has already given me lengthy extension that was very generous, so with the little time I have I\u2019ll be working on that. I will try my best to respond, but my responses will be more thorough after that is finished.

For example, in AW the hard holder gets a stronghold and this sets up the story and drives the plot, other player\u2019s get other stuff, like a gang or following, etc. However, with GoT, the characters need to be more dynamic; sometimes Jon Snow needs to have an army but sometimes he needs to do other things on his own that are completely unrelated and need different framing devices depending on the given session. Is the solution to have multiple Jon Snow role options, or more choices (that are grouped and directed to produce different types of \u2018episodes)? Or is there other better solutions? <br/><br/>Actually, the more I\u2019m thinking about it, this type of thing may best be taken care of with the larger moves (whatever their called), not basic moves or character specific moves? Of course, I\u2019m getting ahead of myself with these questions. I don\u2019t really have the exposure or context yet to do them justice. That said, from what I\u2019ve seen so far, PbtA looks like the right vehicle for the game, at least to start with.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to try to get the scope and depth of GoT in the most elegant way possible; that will likely be a challenge that will require a lot of playtesting.  <br/><br/>I think the thing that\u2019s going to differentiate my game from other PbtA games inspired by Game of Thrones, is that there will be more player vs player content; the Great Game will be a significant part of it. So I\u2019ll have to figure out a way to do that in which players don\u2019t just kill each other early in the process. I may strike medium ground where players have a back up character so that death won\u2019t be so disruptive. <br/><br/>Anyway Paul, I better get back to working on HoS now. I will get back to your, or any other,  responses later.
