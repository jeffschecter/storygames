It was my first time playing the system. (More info about the system <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2012/06/world-of-dungeons.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)<br/><br/>The GM, Wuxiadaddy, is a veteran gamer in his 40s, playing out of nostalgia.  The party consisted of two players, one of them myself, and one of them a seven-year-old kid. The GM made up a module for the game (some of it off the cuff), and we played through the first scenario, which ended at a nice cliffhanger.  The game manual is all of three pages long, and much of the game world is assumed from Gygax's original D&amp;D.<br/><br/><b>Character Creation</b><br/><br/>The GM asked the younger player to choose a character class first.  "Do rangers get pets? And can they fight?"  These were the characteristics important to this player.  The player ended up choosing a ranger. When offered a list of pregenerated names, the player went to dig in a bookshelf.<br/><br/>"I'll pick my name from mythology."  After going through Norse mythology and Indian mythology, an appropriate name was finally chosen from Greek mythology. While the younger player chose a name, I decided that I'd best be a cleric to balance the party, despite the fact that my usual go-to character is a big and somewhat maxed-out fighter.  <br/><br/>We rolled for stats, 2D6 for the typical six.  The way the game is played, rolling a 2 - 6 gives a bonus of +0, 7 - 9 is +1, 10 or 11 is +2, and 12 is +3.  Our initial rolls sucked, with the youngster getting four sixes.  We were allowed to re-roll anything 2 - 6, and ended up with four +1 and two +0.  The younger player put the four pluses into typical ranger statistics, leaving charisma and intelligence at 0.  I lucked out with three +1, one +3 (into WIS of course), and two +0 (STR and DEX).<br/><br/>Equipment was the basic stuff, but the youngster had a great deal of fun describing armor.  This player insisted that the ranger (named Artemis for skill with the bow) would wear a light armor that looked like a woven golden dress.  Artemis's pet was a big fluffy white snow leopard named Zeus.<br/><br/>We both began at level 1.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/><b>Starting Scenario</b><br/><br/>The party, consisting of the cleric Ponyo, the ranger Artemis, and the snow leopard Zeus, had been traveling with an eccentric old woman named Freja.  The GM explained our history, telling us that we'd slain many mighty rats together on various wanderings around the countryside.<br/><br/>"Rats," I muttered. "Why does it always have to be rats."<br/><br/>Here the young player interrupted, excited about helping with world invention.  "And there was one time that we helped kill a deer stuck in someone's basement!"<br/><br/>The GM, with whom I have played before, generally likes initiative from characters, and jumped on the storytelling assist.  "I really liked when we made the deer into sausage," the GM said in Freja's voice, "And I brought it all with me here! -- Freja opened her cloak to reveal long rows of sausages hanging from her cloak."<br/><br/>Soon the GM stopped the digressing and got to the point.  "There's a strawberry blight in the village of Bolingard! (Freja told you.)  You must go investigate!  People say that somehow it's connected to an old tower with strange lights in it, the tower of Errbear."<br/><br/>"So there's an evil spirit in the tower," said the ranger, immediately practical.<br/><br/>But the cleric raised a hand, cautioning. "Now wait, Artemis.  Freja said that the strawberries were blighted.  Why don't we fix the strawberries? We could do that by finding some bees and bringing them to the strawberry patch to help with pollination."  The cleric has a lot of wisdom, obviously\u2026 And as a player, I tend to resist railroading.<br/><br/>"Oh," said the ranger, reconsidering. "Okay. We'll go find some bees."<br/><br/>The GM looked very amused at this attempt to derail the plot, but acquiesced gracefully.<br/><br/>In the morning, Freja was gone, but left some sausages behind.  Artemis, Zeus, and Ponyo went trekking through the wilds toward the blighted village of Bolingard, looking for bees.<br/><br/>Then we had a series of bad luck!<br/><br/>The first attempt to find a beehive and stick it into a bag kind of worked. The intrepid ranger Artemis swiftly found a beehive high in a tree and climbed it in a jiffy (winning a dexterity test), but the GM, in order to make things more interesting, had the ranger roll to see if the bees got into the bag.<br/><br/>Flubbed roll!  Some of the bees didn't get into the bag with the hive, and what's more, the noise attracted a bear!<br/><br/>Weakling that my cleric is, I decided that the best bet was to climb up the tree.  My cleric wears heavy armor, however, and given the cleric's lack of bonuses in dexterity and a flubbed roll, the bear soon rolled the cleric over!<br/><br/>"Drop the bag of beehive on the bear!" The cleric hollered.<br/><br/>The ranger did so, luckily landing the bag on the bear instead of the bruised cleric\u2026<br/><br/>The bear, distracted by all the honey and angry bees, flailed and bellowed while the characters fled!<br/><br/>We gave the hunt for bees one more go, but this time, a series of bad rolls had the ranger all stung up right away.  The characters ran toward the nearest mud puddle to escape the angry swarm, but even this didn't stem the ire of the bees.  Zeus sat and glared at the ranger and cleric from the edge of the mud puddle, looking very disapproving (and pristine) while we wallowed.<br/><br/>"Let's give up on this bee business and just find the haunted tower," the cleric said with a sigh.<br/><br/>But on our way to Bolingard, we met a grumpy old farmer.<br/><br/>Neither one of the characters had any charm, but (after rolling a natural 12), the young ranger seemed to have melted his heart somewhat, and he was swiftly telling the ranger all about his rotten, yellowing, sickly crop of nigh-sentient strawberries.<br/><br/>"We'd better go look at the strawberries!" The cleric said, and soon they were off.<br/><br/>An excellent role from the ranger had them at the center of the diseased patch in no time, but \u2026 was it actually a good place to be?<br/><br/>The strawberries looked yellow, menacing, enormous\u2026and suddenly the ranger noticed faces!<br/><br/>That's when the characters engaged in their first melee of the game.  <br/><br/>The cleric, sensing some seriously bad juju, blessed (for +3 against evil) the ranger's bow (D6+1). The ranger also had the special ability of Volley, which added +2 to hit.  The ranger shot very well, and her best shot skewered six evil strawberries like so many shish kebobs.  <br/><br/>The cleric also got into the fray, and when the ranger was pinioned by evil strawberries, managed to squish a few with some skillful staffwork.<br/><br/>But then the cleric noticed an evil symbol on the ground\u2026 Oh too late!  With an unlucky misstep the ranger stumbled back onto it, and a pit opened beneath Artemis's feet!<br/><br/>Artemis tumbled into a hole, and without pausing long to consider, Zeus and Ponyo hopped in after.<br/><br/>The first order of business in the thankfully strawberry-free hole was some healing.  But the holy glow of good awakened something in the dark, dank hole.<br/><br/>And suddenly, the ranger and cleric (and leopard) noticed something staring at them from the darkness, staring with glowing red eyes...<br/><br/>And that's where we ended play for the session, because it was the youngest player's bed time.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>All in all, playing with my husband and daughter was interesting.  He's an accomplished GM who gives the players great flexibility with storytelling and world creation, even while adding enough unsubtle railroading to engage a seven year old.  My daughter got far too into it, god-moding a little, but was gently reminded that the story was collaborative rather than just hers.  <br/><br/>All in all the rules were blessedly easy for her to comprehend ("So I roll these two and then add that?") and got us storytelling swiftly, providing just the right kinds of contests in a number of situations.<br/><br/>I look forward to our next household game!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389655/#Comment_389655" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T19:30:30+00:00" title="September  8, 2012  7:30PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 for the deer-sausage-filled cloak!<br/><br/>But I don't remember seeing any sentient strawberries in the 1st edition monster manual...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WeeTanya" title="WeeTanya"><img alt="WeeTanya" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/325/nWRENWZESH246.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WeeTanya">WeeTanya</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389656/#Comment_389656" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T19:31:20+00:00" title="September  8, 2012  7:31PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They became strawberry gelatinous cubes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389661/#Comment_389661" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T21:20:29+00:00" title="September  8, 2012  9:20PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds a lot like when I used WoD to run a game for my daughter.

This led to her asking to play <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>.  She didn't want to play other RPGs (which we had tried two or three times with mixed success).  But I didn't expect her to sit through making characters and learning the rules for even the simplest form of real D&amp;D.  So <b><i>World of Dungeons</i></b>'s minimalist rulesest and old-school aesthetic worked perfectly.  It looked and ran like D&amp;D but didn't require twenty pages or more of rules.<br/><br/>She chose to play a wizard, so that she could cast magic spells.  We rolled stats in order, but she still wound up with decent stats for a wizard: +1 or +2 in Int, Cha and Con.  She picked a spirit of shadow named <b>Dark-As-Night</b> and a spirit of fire named <b>Bonfire</b>.  Some equipment was bought and she picked the name <b>Eupendra </b>off the list because it sounded nice.<br/><br/>My younger daughter also rolled up a cleric named <b>Lyra</b>, but she quickly lost interest in the game once we were actually playing.<br/><br/>Eupendra lived as the local hedge wizard for a tiny fantasy town.  Farmers would come to her for help with stuff that they didn't understand.  At the start of play, a farmer asked her to find his lost sheep.  It had wandered away near a local cave.  He went into the cave looking for it, but was quickly scared off by weird mushroom people living in the cave.  Eupendra agreed to go looking the sheep.<br/><br/>Inside the cave, there were two mushroom people.  They were a little scary looking, but they didn't start attacking right away.  Eupendra tried to talk with them and ask if they had seen the missing sheep.  But the mushroom people only spoke in a weird gibberish noise.  After a few Charisma and Decipher rolls and some hand waving, she started to understand.  the mushroom people had seen the sheep wander past them deeper into the cave.  But they were afraid of a skeleton that direction, so they wouldn't go any deeper.<br/><br/>At this point, my daughter was afraid of the skeleton, too.  But we talked about how she was a brave adventurer and she rolled Lore to figure out that the skeleton had a fatal flaw.  Skeleton guards only could see but couldn't hear or smell.  So if she had her shadow spirit hide her, then she could sneak past it.  She also had her cleric friend Bless her weapon (the last thing my younger daughter did before wandering away from the game).  Much of this plan was me suggesting ways Eupendra could use her abilities to defeat the skeleton, as she hadn't used her magic at all yet.  Then she started trying to figure out how to defeat the skeleton most effectively.<br/><br/>She summoned Dark-As-Night and she asked it to hide herself and the mushroom men.  The mushroom men still didn't want to go, though, so just Eupendra turned invisible and moved on down the cave.  Around a bend, she found the skeleton as described, guarding a doorway through which chanting could be heard.  She snuck behind the skeleton just as planned and then launched an ambush with her Blessed club.  Surprise plus Blessing meant that she took out the skeleton in one hit.  <br/><br/>After looting a scimitar from the skeleton, Eupendra decided to be prepared.  She had already learned via Lore that the skeleton had been made by a wizard or necromancer or something.  And so beyond the door must be the skeleton's creator, who must have the missing sheep.  She summoned Bonfire and asked to be able to shoot fire from her hands.  I rolled the die of fate and determined that Bonfire could let her fire 4 blasts.  She then burst through the door, ready for battle.<br/><br/>Inside was a goblin wearing ill fitting wizard's robes.  He had the missing sheep tied up in a magic circle and a smallish herd of zombified farm anmals in a pen.  The goblin was clearly trying to make the sheep into his zombie slave.  A short battle ensued, where Eupendra blasted the goblinwith fire, and he created a wall of bones to hide behind and the goblin sent the zombie animals after her and they got blasted by fire too and finally the goblin was on the ground asking for forgiveness.  He had just wanted to learn to be a wizard, so he had stolen this ritual gear and stuff and was learning how to make undead things.  Eupendra demanded he give back the missing sheep and give her the stolen ritual compnents.  He agreed, but asked if he could become her wizardly apprentice.
