You describe something happening in the scene, and how you describe that changes the mechanical outcome.  For example, in My Life With Master, you describe how your character is carrying out the Master's command, and if your description portrays "desperation", you get a bonus die (d6?).  You narrate something in order to roll the dice.<br/><br/>In some other games, you engage with the mechanics in order to be able to narrate something.  Most traditional games work this way.  In order to describe killing the orc, you first have to roll to hit with your sword.  TSoY is a good indie example, but there are lots.  In TSoY, in order to describe the outcome you want from a conflict, you first have to roll the dice.  You roll the dice in order to narrate something.<br/><br/>It seems like this is a fairly important distinction between two types of mechanic.  They feel quite different in play.  They probably both have advantages and disadvantages depending on taste and goals.  Quite a few gamist games use the first approach, for example, to encourage narration in a game that would otherwise just be rolling dice.  The latter approach I think is popular with trad games because it works well with the reward cycle - more mechanical power equals more narrative power.  <br/><br/>The two kinds of mechanic aren't mutually exclusive though.  Sorcerer's bonus dice are an example of narrating something for mechanical advantage, but also requiring a mechanical success in order to narrate getting your goal.  Most games that use the first approach, in fact, usually have some degree of narration that happens after the roll, rather than before.<br/><br/>Then there are much more complicated examples, like <i>Dogs</i>, where dice rolling and narration are kinda happening at the same time, and sometimes you're narrating to get dice, and sometimes you're rolling dice to get the narration you want.  Dust Devils has a pretty complex interaction between the two, where you need to win hands to narrate the outcome of the conflict you want, but a lot of how you describe the setup to the conflict (going against your Devil, and whatnot) has a major effect on the mechanics of the conflict.  I haven't played a lot of games like this, but my feeling is that they're quite difficult to design.<br/><br/>So, my thesis is that this is a useful distinction to think about when designing a game.  My preference is for the latter technique - rolling in order to narrate.  In play, I feel like when I'm narrating something in order to get the dice I want, I'm doing work, and the dice are the reward.  For me, it makes the narration feel like a chore, and the mechanical framework of the game begins to feel like the central point.  On the other hand, for a group where the agenda is stongly focused on the narration being the point of play, I can see that this doesn't have to be the point.  I think <i>Business Solutions</i> (from the playtest drafts I've seen) and Roach kind of play on this - if you go into them seeing the narration as a chore required for winning, then you're going to get a pretty dull game.  You have to enjoy narration for the sake of it.  <br/><br/>As for games that seem to blend the two approaches, or have a different approach entirely, I really don't know enough to comment.  Is there a "third way"? What does <i>Dogs</i> feel like in play, in this regard?\u3000Does it depend on the agenda of the group?  My feeling here is that games with the first mechanic rely a lot more on the group's agenda to make the game work.  Is that a fair assessment?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138457/#Comment_138457" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T00:11:01+00:00" title="April  7, 2008 12:11AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That strikes me as a very insightful division, and I think a lot hangs off it in terms of the feel of the game. I think there is something key about what you feel the central goal of the game is, is it to have narration, or is it to win at dice? Narrating to get dice makes the dice the important bit, because you are jumping through a hoop to get them. Rolling to get narration makes narration the key thing, with the dice being the obstacle to get there.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what a design that does both is exalting though                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138471/#Comment_138471" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T03:00:28+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  3:00AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I can stop tormenting myself.

If I pass the roll I jump the chasm, but I don't get to narrate it, if anyone does it is the GM. In fact my narration is my attempt to jump i.e. I narrate something so as to get to use the dice. Sure I forward the fiction in the direction I want by rolling, but it doesn't have to be like that. You can easily imagine this<br/><br/>Player : I walk along the corridor<br/>GM : Roll dice or die!<br/>Player : I roll and pass<br/>GM : The concealed pit trap does not kill you<br/><br/>Slightly disfunctional perhaps, but perfectly likely, nowhere did the Player get to narrate anything, they just rolled to pass a test demanded by the fiction. Now imagine a game where I can get bonuses by narrating things in (lots of games do this), so we get <br/><br/>Player : I walk along the corridor<br/>GM : Roll dice or die in a pit!<br/>Player : I yell my dungeoneers war cry, and throw my whip around a beam ... that's plus 2 dice, I roll and pass<br/>GM : The concealed pit trap does not kill you<br/><br/>So there I narrated in order to get dice, but the dice did not allow me to narrate                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138525/#Comment_138525" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T08:33:20+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  8:33AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A "traditional" (whatever that means) example of the first category would be Feng Shui, which penalizes you for boring or repetitive narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138607/#Comment_138607" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T17:08:21+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  5:08PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, I think you're taking a more specific definition of "narrate" than I originally intended, but your analysis is pretty sound.  I tend to think of "I walk along the corridor" as narration, just as much as "I yell my dungeoneer's cry..." <br/><br/>Perhaps if you change "narrate" in my original post with "add stuff to the fiction", you'll get closer to my meaning.<br/><br/>Here's a question: Is this just IIEE? By which I mean, is this purely a function of where in the conflict you roll the dice?  When I originally imagined this I dea, I didn't think so, but in a lot of my examples, I think I slipped into conflating the two.  Here's a restatement:<br/><br/>The distinction is:<br/><br/>"If you want to add something to the fiction, you have to roll the dice"<br/><br/>vs.<br/><br/>"If you want to roll the dice, you have to add something to the fiction"<br/><br/>Some games have an overall "dice game" structure, that functions pretty well independant of the fiction.  MLWM is the best example of this that I have experience with.  The economy of Love, Self Loathing, and Weariness is managed entirely by the dice.  The players choose what type of scene they'll play, and that affects the outcome, but that's barely adding anything to the fiction.  The only impact that adding stuff to the fiction has on the dice game is the "desperation", "sincerity" and (one other I don't recall) dice.  The dice game is a kind of armature on which you hang your story.  If you're not invested in the story from the start, there's only the dice game there.  (I think that's at the heart of a lot of the "board game" criticisms of MLWM).<br/><br/>I haven't played Roach, so I don't really know, but my impression is that it's the same kind of thing.  There's a dice game at the heart of it, and you kind of hang your story around it.  Certainly that's how the playtest draft of Business Solutions looked to me.<br/><br/>An argument could be made that conflicts in Dogs are the same thing.  It's a dice game, and the stuff you add to the fiction in the middle doesn't need to be there to make it work.  The only time they interact is when you add stuff to the fiction in order to roll in extra traits.  It's the same kind of stand-alone dice game, which inspires and supports the story.  Dogs is a far more complex case though, I think, because of the way that some of the things you add to the fiction have more weight than others.  You can really skew the outcome of the dice game by narrating things into the conflict that your opponent just can't live with.  "Giving" also fundamentally changes the way the game works.  So I think Dogs could go either way (and I think that misunderstandings about conflicts in Dogs, and treating conflicts as just a dice game, is a cause of some groups failing to enjoy the game).<br/><br/>So I think what the fundamental distinction between the types of mechanics is what the end result looks like.  I find it hard to describe this because I think I don't really understand this kind of play very well.  In MLWM the end result of play is the completion of the dice game, with someone having killed the Master.  You're adding stuff to the fiction in order to reach that goal (but ALSO to tell a cathartic story - and that's where my confusion comes in).  In Roach the end point is someone winning the game (I think), and you add stuff to the fiction in order to get to that (but also because you're trying to make an entertaining story with your friends).  <br/><br/>These games are on one end of a spectrum, I think.  There are some games which hang around the middle.  Sorcerer's conflicts, with successes rolled into future conflicts, is a mini dice game, though a very simple one.  You're adding stuff to the fiction in order to achieve success on your overall goal.  D&amp;D combat is a very interesting example, because it's a reasonably interesting tactical game on its own, without any input from the fiction.  Outside of combat, D&amp;D follows the usual "if you want to add something to the fiction, you have to roll the dice" model.  In combat though, I think that reverses.  People want to roll the dice, so they can kill the monsters, and their character can go up levels.  To do that, they have to describe their character doing stuff, at least a little.  <br/><br/>Is that getting clearer?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138618/#Comment_138618" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T18:56:35+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  6:56PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2008 6:58PM by Johnstone.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, Simon, both answers give me a much clearer idea of this.<br/><br/>Adding to the fiction and succeeding are clearly different things - as we can see from MLWM and the Roach (you're right about the Roach, and winning is a fairly boring component of the game). But what about games where there is no dice game and winning is mostly a matter of narration? DnD may have an abstract game inside of it, but what about games where this is much weaker, like Call of Cthulhu, Vampire, or Ars Magica? (and feel free to disagree with those title, too)<br/><br/><br/>Also, how important do you think the distinction between "encourages" and "requires" is?<br/>David's example where he gets more dice from narration encourages narration, but the DitV rules require narration when you put your dice forward.<br/><br/>I can see distinctions separating like this:<br/><br/>I want to roll my dice (to win the dice game), but I am required to narrate in order to do that.<br/><br/>I want to roll my dice, and I will get more dice if I narrate, than if I don't narrate.<br/><br/>I want to narrate, and I roll dice to make my narration have an impact on the fiction.<br/><br/>I want to narrate, and I have to roll dice in order to narrate at all.<br/><br/>Or no?<br/><br/>I think I am inclined to agree with your preference, Simon. I also like Wises, or Circles, in Burning Wheel - I can narrate, but I need to roll to make that narration have a positive (for my character) impact on the story - failing the roll doesn't have to invalidate the narration, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138626/#Comment_138626" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T19:54:13+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  7:54PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite><br/>I can see distinctions separating like this:<br/><br/>I want to roll my dice (to win the dice game), but I am required to narrate in order to do that.<br/><br/>I want to roll my dice, and I will get more dice if I narrate, than if I don't narrate.<br/><br/>I want to narrate, and I roll dice to make my narration have an impact on the fiction.<br/><br/>I want to narrate, and I have to roll dice in order to narrate at all.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nThat's a very perceptive refinement.  <br/><br/>I think the way to make this distinction useful to designers and players is to look at what effect each type of mechanic has on play - what it feels like when you play it.

As I posted somewhere else a little while back I had this problem with Shock. In the middle of a really gripping fiction, that I was totally invested in, I had to narrate these bits of minutae to justify my use of audience dice, and I totally didn't care about them at all ... and never used them again.

We don't care whether or not the events are described or not in narration, only that they get established in play somehow. It's a question of who gets to establish what. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the only thing that's really important here is if the narrative is contested. So any narration done before hand, narration that gets you power, is not contested. You're given full authority to make up your moves in JDs example of Feng Shui. Nobody can so, "Oh no you don't" and make you roll to see if you do that backflip over your opponent and attack him from above. These events are added throught the narration directly into the narrative. They can only contest whether or not you pull out his collarbones on the way over. The result of which roll decides what is entered into the narrative. Even if that result is "He takes four points of damage" and has no narration to it at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the example is a case of penalizing poor narration. The result of which is control (or lack thereof) of narrative. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you have one mechanic type that rewards good narration. And you have another that determines control of the narrative. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, a lot of this is to do with IIEE.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138689/#Comment_138689" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T09:44:41+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  9:44AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's another wrinkle: I apparently design games in which you can narrate and/or roleplay at any time, however, what you narrate does not have any mechanical weight to it unless you roll dice or play cards to back up that narration.  Both <em>Sons of Liberty</em> and <em>Agora</em> work like this.  One recurrent problem I find cropping up is that people then default to not speaking at all unless they can play cards or roll dice to back up what they are saying.  This is unfortunate, as you can do a lot of what Chris Chin calls "fictional positioning," setting up what you're going to do later (and backing up that later narration with cards/dice).  I'm not entirely sure how I will crack this nut for Agora (in SoL things go so fast this generally isn't an issue).<br/><br/>So perhaps add that one to the list: I want to win some sort of mechanical reward, and so I narrate in order to engage the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138785/#Comment_138785" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T21:12:14+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  9:12PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Blood Red Sands, narration is all about the positioning and consequences.  For instance you position prior to a conflict to ensure that only the opponents you want to fight are present when the conflict begins.  You position to seperate an enemy from their body guards.  You position to catch a rival in a compromising state.  Positioning then lead into who can participate in a conflict and what Traits are useable.  The only way to prevent my positioning is to challenge it (when its silly or unreasonable) or enter into a conflict to stop it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou use consequences to goad someone into a conflict, or weaken them because they aren't willing to enter a conflict.  I might narrate my character intimidating the town chieftain and thus giving the chief (your character) the weakness Trait of "Intimidated by Karn" (my character).  That will either stir you into conflict with me, or, if I've positioned myself strongly enough that you don't think you can take me, you eat the weakness (becoming immune to further such conseqences for the rest of my turn) and I've just used the narration of our encounter as a weapon against you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a conflict you use narration the same way only there is no way to stop it except to win the exchange.  Each time I advance dice against you I tie narration to it like "you're weapon goes flying into the swamp sinking into the muck" or "your horse throws you and bolts away" or "I've cut you off from your reinforcements" or "I hack your arm from your body blinding you with a shower of blood from your own mangled stump".  If you can't beat my dice, it happens, if you can, it doesn't.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key difference I see between this use of narration and many (most?) other story-games is that in other games the narration is what you want.  You're fighting over who gets to have the narration the way they want it.  In BRS having the narration the way you want it is secondary to using the narration to get what you really want, victory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138786/#Comment_138786" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T21:31:58+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  9:31PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Ralph,<br><br>What's the difference (in terms of mechanics) between narrating "I tear off your arm and beat you with it" and "I poke you in the eye"?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138792/#Comment_138792" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-09T00:25:41+00:00" title="April  9, 2008 12:25AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this relates to the discussion of how do you encourage Roleplaying, where I was bothered by the fact that it seemed to me that Roleplaying shouldn't need encouraging, because I see it as the point of playing an RPG.

I think one can play a role without doing any narration, especially without first person narration. <br>\n<br>\nBut, anyhow, the more important point I want to make is that the sort of first person narration that people do sometimes refer to as "roleplaying" in such contexts is, to me, not a goal of play.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet that sink in. I frankly don't care in many cases if we do any narration at all. Especially if/when it's color, I don't see it as important. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeaning, Josh, if I played your game, and it did not incentivize such narration except during certain parts where it was mechanically important, I'd probably be ecstatic to find all of that extra narration cut from play. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me discuss this a little more deeply. I've been over this before, but here goes again. I think that "roleplaying" (again first person narration of character speech and/or description of actions, etc), became the *assumed* sumum bonum for play in the wayback. Around the 80s for most. "Good play" became "entertaining portrayal of your character, like speaking in character." Lots of game texts say stuff like this. But they were missing the target. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically at that point the only way to convey to a player that we wanted them to make thematic decisions was to say, "play in-character." And the method that we thought would get people to "play in-character" was to have them narrate their character's speech and actions, etc. After all, if we have them do realistic banter, then they'll be making decisions as thought they "were" the character. And if that happens, then we'll get the stuff of stories, instead of getting all tactical play. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, turns out that this leads to simulationism. The original Beeg Horseshoe theory by Jared says that, in fact, simulationism was a big bad detour on the way to getting to narrativism. I won't debate the merits (and have proferred lots of opinions on the subject most of which are somewhat conciliatory). But the point is that I agree that, if narrativism is really what you want, then you aren't going to get it simply through encouraging first-person narration and such. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I can easily argue the counter. Using, say third person past tense (as in Puppetland) will much more likely produce the sort of author stance play that will much more likely produce narrativism. And a system in which you do little narration at all, but focuses on the thematic choices in question, will produce it even more reliably. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of which is not to say that you can't desire to see more of this sort of stuff promoted in your RPG design. If that's your design goal, if you want to see the game produce play like that, go for it. But, for my money, to hell with promoting purple prose. Oh, I'm as guilty as the next player of chewing scenery. I'm not saying it's not fun at times. But I think that it's just as functional for players to narrate just as much as they are comfortable narrating. And that what I really want promoted is the player having interesting decisions to make, and giving them the power to make them. Which has nothing to do with how much they narrate about the events, or the quality of the narration, or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Laws was wrong... we don't need to penalize players for repetitiveness in combat, we have to make combat systems that don't drive us boringly to repetition. If the player isn't interested in the combat enough to make interesting decisions about what his character is doing in that combat, then we're not going to make it interesting for him by forcing him to do creative narration or risk having his character get defeated? Maybe if the player cared, he would just be more entertaining. There's nothing as fun as the contaigion of other participants having fun. All I want is a smile. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my preference, of course, but I think that RPG requirements for narration are overestimated, and often are an attempt to address a symptom without treating the real problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138926/#Comment_138926" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-09T22:21:38+00:00" title="April  9, 2008 10:21PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, mechanically nothing.
