We're starting a new Solar System campaign - epic Conan-style fantasy, tightly scripted (each episode has a title, like "Cormac Vs. The Snake-Men") and he's running it.  We arrived for a session devoted to making characters and fleshing out the world and didn't have much else to go on.  <br/><br/>One thing we'd agreed - we were each going to play against type.  This meant I (who tends toward abrasive, provocative troublemakers) would play a good friend and loyal companion.  Robo (who tends to play utter fuckups) would be our strong leader.  My brother (who plays sneaky, manipulative weasels) would be a barbarian warrior.  This in itself is pure awesome and we were pretty excited.<br/><br/>So we knew our type, but that was it.  We built the characters up as a group.  Joel passed out cards labeled JUDGE, VICTIM, ALLY, VILLAIN, and LACKEY.  These were the roles we'd play in the character-building vignette, and after each, we'd rotate.  So everybody got to try every role, and have their character highlighted in their own vignette.  <br/><br/>The Judge established situation and a simple conflict.<br/>The Victim was a problem or responsibility.<br/>The Villain provided adversity.<br/>The Ally was a supportive force.<br/>The Lackey was whatever else needed to happen.<br/><br/>Oh, and we knew how each of these vignettes ended - with out characters chained to an oar aboard a slave trireme.<br/><br/>This worked great.  So Steve's scene - we know, since he's usually the leader and straight man, that in this game he's playing a milquetoast loser.  Greg, the Judge, sets the scene - in the distant north, Steve's guy is going to have to stand up to a bully.  I'm the Victim, and I make it his mother - a widow barely scraping by.  Ian's the Villain, and he describes a drunk forester smacking the poor woman around for spilling a drink on him.  The Ally, Robo, turns out to be the women of the village, who know and appreciate Steve's meek character (modeled after Fiver in Watership Down).  Scott, the Lackey, is the hostile, drunk crowd.  Robo embellishes a bit - the women of the town have gathered a sack of gold, enough to get Steve's guy a wagon-ride into the big city.  The teamster is waiting outside, ready to go.<br/><br/>So, you know, boom!  Steve gets to show off his dude and face off against a drunken mob of tough guys.  We get to see what sort of guy he is, a snapshot of how he operates, and he does stand up for his mom, and gets a king-hell beat-down for his trouble.  He's thrown on the wagon, there's a tearful farewell, he leaves his doomed mother behind, and the wagon-driver sells him on the cheap to the slavers.  <br/><br/>It was a wonderful way to start the campaign - we all helped each other breathe life and backstory into our characters and we're all excited to see where they go next.  I think Joel was pulling from Polaris and PTA a bit in his inspiration, and I really loved the way it worked.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209355/#Comment_209355" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T05:05:31+00:00" title="May 28, 2009  5:05AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds really cool.

Or let the GM assume these roles.  <br/><br/>Throughout this process Joel, as GM, injected bits of color (he's got a whole world full of nations loosely mapped out, so he'd be like "That sounds like the fortress mountain of Bellona" and we'd go with that).  Other than that he didn't have much to do other than observe and throw in suggestions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209360/#Comment_209360" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T06:43:30+00:00" title="May 28, 2009  6:43AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            sounds like a fun jump-start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
