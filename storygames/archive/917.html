                    Yeah, yeah, I know, Immersion is one of those tar-baby words.  Tough.<br/>
<br/>
Here's my take on immersion: I feel immersed in a character when I feel the visceral responses in my own body, or at least shadows of them, that my character would be feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Intense, risky, well-described, well-paced combat and action scenes get my adrenaline up.<br/>
<br/>
Painful, angsty, wrenching scenes make me cry.<br/>
<br/>
Et (best left unsaid) cetera.<br/>
<br/>
That's what *I* mean by immersion.<br/>
<br/>
As such, immersion depends on my intellectual and emotional state as much or more than it does on qualities of play.                </div>

                            For our group, Immersion has taken a tone of "how much do you get into and stay in character"?<br/><br/>The players (2) in my group that have the harder time of staying in character (and have the self-reflective habit of doing the "I don't see why my character would go into that dungeon. She isn't that reckless" etc thing), have come to the realization three weeks ago that, for them, PTA is the best game for them for "immersion". They pretty much stay in character the whole time. And Beth, who is the big TV head (and one of the two players above) will totally roll with whatever, including doing bizarre/risky/out-of-character's-personality things, "because people do that all the time on TV, I don't even feel the need to justify it!".<br/><br/>Freaky.                        </div>

                            I love the "people do that all the time on TV" escape hatch (to a point, of course). I think the TV analogy is helpful for new gamers, and I remember thinking that they'd have a much easier time with games like Eden's Buffy and Angel rpgs. They don't need to worry, "Am I doing this right?" They know the characters.<br/>
<br/>
For me, immersion is sorta like flow. Wnen it's on maximum, I don't have to think; I just do.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have to worry about minimaxing and strategy. To the degree I do, immersion is threatened.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn't mean strategy is bad. It doesn't mean a good designer can't build it in to immersion. For me, the Dogs bidding system clicks. For my friend Beth, it so doesn't. It pulls her out of immersion. More accurately, she goes into an out of immersion in a way she finds distracting. For her, lack of immersion is better than this back and forth. She likes the Marvel Diceless game, whereas I find that has far too much strategy for me to either enjoy or be immersed.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have to worry about breaking the game or interfering with someone else's fun. To the degree I do, immersion is threatened.<br/>
<br/>
Again, not necessarily a bad. I should be paying enough attention to make sure we're all having fun. But, sometimes, I don't have to. We're all on the same page, all jazzed, probably immersed -- and it's great. And, if I'm thinking, "Hm, I've been hogging the limelight," well, better immersion be threatened than our fun.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have to worry about being in character. I don't ask, "Would my character do X?" I know. For best results, I know what to do that is in character and helps everyone increase their enjoyment of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Practice can help with this. One of the things Josh taught me was, "Pay attention. If you do, you can find an in-character reason for just about anything." Use this as a feature, not a bug.<br/>
<br/>
Physical reactions? Eh. If my character is worrying about money, starving, whatever, I really don't want to have physical reactions. I'd rather be like, "Cool!" when something awful is happening to my character than like, "Ouch. I, myself, am in pain." This is counter-immersive. Wanting that level of disengagement threatens immersion. And, that's okay, too. Other physical reactions? It depends, but I think I err on the side of less immersion.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, while I want to be like, "Cool!", I also want to be able to let the character freak out or whatever.<br/>

                            Sure, but movies are a different media.<br/>
<br/>
It probably is also telling that I get this flow thing when I write. When things click, I get out of the way of the words pouring onto the paper (or the keyboard -- though it's probably also telling that I like to write longhand).<br/>
<br/>
This applies to writing larp characters. It also applies to essays. (I still remember the feeling, though not what I actually wrote on one particular college midterm, where I stared at the words flowing with the ink, thinking, "Damn, that's good." Given my grades, the professor must have agreed.)<br/>
<br/>
I think different definitions of "immersion" when I think book/movie than when I think writing/roleplaying.<br/>

                            Ah, you see, and I don't.  Movie immersion feels the same to me as roleplay immersion, though stronger.<br/>
<br/>
I don't really have a term for the state of mind that you are calling writing/roleplaying immersion, but I know what you're talking about.  It can go together but it's not the same thing.                        </div>

                            Fred:  Are you labelling as "immersion" any moment in roleplaying where you are emotionally touched as a player and human being?<br/>
<br/>
Suppose your character is a stone-cold son-of-a-bitch Watchdog of God, and some sobbing girl makes a desperate plea for clemency.  Your guy shoots her in the face without a moment of regret, because that's who he is, but you (the player) are choking back tears because of the raw sadness of the situation as a whole and your part in it in particular.<br/>

                            At the risk of seeming overwrought, it could be that we're talking about immersion as a transitive verb: immersing into different components of exploration: character, situation, etc.  Is it possible that what we're talking about for movies is (often) an immersion of situation?<br>
<br>
Another example, don't chess masters get into a kind of trance, and isn't this an immersion into, like, system?<br>
<br>
Another example: I've been in a couple gaming sessions which have drifted into collaborative worldbuilding.  In this case, predicting the next decade or two of the future: politics, technology, culture, etc.  In those sessions, there were moments when I got really excited about something, eager to share and expand on the idea, and then other people riffed on it -- and it's amazingly fun, and we all started finishing each others' sentences and when we proposed a new idea, and tied it into lots of other proposed idea -- and you could feel the future setting take shape.  Is this sort of feeling an immersion of setting?<br>
<br>
Hmm.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I was just playing AG&amp;G last night and was totally into my character. I wanted what she wants. I was afraid of what she was afraid of. In the real world, this character would be a <i>horror</i>. Violent, apolitical (not as in, she didn't care about politics; as in she was just learning that politics existed), and a powerful leader of men. I would normally put her in the category of villain. But I really liked being her for a couple of hours,  seeing things from her perspective, acting as she'd act. I could practically smell where we were ... (now that I think about it, there were several scenes with food. Maybe I was hungry.)<br><br>It's great.<br><br>It's also very common. I honestly don't know what the big deal is about it. This is a game where I was learning the mechanics for the very first time, and it still didn't yank me out of the fiction unduly when I had to roll the bones. The only time I've felt this disconnect between fiction and the game itself is when the mechanics don't match my Agenda; specifically playing D&amp;D with a character not optimized for anything system-supported. I didn't get to do what I imagined the dude doing. That breaks immersion. Rolling dice to see if I hit when the character's made to ask philosophical questions is a good way to make me disengage.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Joshua, if I may ask about this particular instance of immersion...<br/>
<br/>
Your post seems to indicate a certain blurring of the boundaries between character and self.  From what you say, desires, emotions, even sensations seem to flow from character to self without restraint.  Would you say this was accurate?<br/>
<br/>
You count the character as a villain, but don't state what makes her so.  You state she's violent and apolitical, but then so is Batman.  What is so horrible about her?<br/>
<br/>
Not every villain is so emotionally contaminated that I would refrain from immersing in them.  Tony's example upthread was, but that doesn't mean that every example would be.<br/>
<br/>
I should probably say that I count myself a fairly "sensitive" person.  By that I mean, that when I immerse, I often carry around the emotions of that immersion for days afterwards.  I just finished the book "Kushiel's Avatar" and if you're familiar with the book you'll know that the darkest parts of the book get very, very dark; even after reading through to the end, and experiencing the very satisfying resolution, I still feel the effects of the middle chapters of the book.  I would never, EVER want to immerse in the character that performed the dark deeds in that book; I fear what it would do to me, and I think rightly so.                        </div>

                            Arnuk's deal was that she was conquoring the world. It's not a goal I have a lot of sympathy for. Like other conquerors, she's causing suffering in others out of a pathology. The fact that she was a woman (secretly) complicates the issue, but doesn't change the fact that she's doing bad things to people because of whatever illness it is that makes powerful people want more power.<br><br>It's interesting, it's fun, to play someone like that and try to see what's going on with them.                        </br></br></div>

<br/>
It's not as emotional, neh?<br/>

I mean Okhfels... with whom I have immersed perhaps deeper than just about any other character I have ever played... he does plenty of evil too, and has some pretty twisted morals.  But in the end he's doing most everything for love.<br/>

                            Redeeming qualities? Sure! She's brave: she's fighting not only the world, but her own peoples' rules about gender. She's passionate, fair, wise and flexible. She's just up to her elbows in blood because she can be, because she's good at what she does, which is lead an army across the desert, rolling over everything large enough to have a well.<br><br>Shooting someone in the face is often a sign (or so cop shows have led me to believe) of psychopathy; that you're not killing that person because of something they did or will do, but because you're attacking their very personhood. So it makes sense to me that it's visceral. But state-sponsored violence scares the shit out of me.                        </br></br></div>

Violent, <b>soul-ful</b> psychopaths ... that's the way to go.  You start getting those emotions going and they bump and grind against each other in fascinating, enlightening, scary ways.                        </div>
