Not that I know all the history &amp; meanings of the word "feminism", but here's the basic idea:<br/>\n<br/>\n- All the characters are women. (This is a way to make up for previous scenarios I've written with weak or non-existent female characters).<br/>\n- These women are active protagonists, not victims of society.<br/>\n- The scenario should pass the Bechdel test ((1) it has to have at least two women in it, who (2) who talk to each other, about (3) something besides a man.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not going to market this as a feminist scenario at the con, but I'd like to have that as a design guideline.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts or ideas?

(as long as everyone isn't clamoring to be the man-character, that is).<br><br>For example, I do "cultural immersion" in gaming all the time, and I find the best way to do that is to have all PCs be from one culture except for one who is from another (the "another" being usually "the mainstream culture") so that the others have something to contrast against, etc. "three mages and a zeppo; three Crab Clan and a Lion clan member; three samurai and a noble; three scientists and a special forces dude; two Russians and an American; four Vietnamese and a Canadian", etc. It worked well to bring up issues (real or fantastical) about those cultures, as there was the one person with a different experience to provide that taste of contrast.<br><br/>I'm just thinking about all the examples of media aimed at sort of a geek crowd where the tagline was "All Women Characters", and it often turns into "Bitch Slap" or "Charlie's Angels"; basically women doing awesome man-action stuff, where they could have just as easily been replaced with Vin Diesel clones. So, empowering and all, but not exactly anything uniquely related to women, just a "reskin" of an Action Man. Some lines of thought are "that's what it's about, /equality/, treating women as exact equals to men", while others think, "All you did was replaced the man-body with a woman-body, keeping everything else the same. What's there to learn about women from that?".<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my 2 cents from the "cultural discernment" level model as applied to what little I understand of feminism/feminist critique. I'll back away slowly and defer to people who know more about the actual topic of feminism to add more.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306385/#Comment_306385" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T10:46:49+00:00" title="December 30, 2010 10:46AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a very interesting question, whether it's valid to just reskin male characters as female (or vice versa). I tend to say "no". While this approach avoids introducing prejudices, it also ignores the differences between genders that make having genders interesting in the first place.<br/><br/>One fascinating way I've seen to add very strong feminine traits to an action character is to give her a child to take care of at the same time. (Of course you can do this with a male character too, but it plays up different paternal characteristics instead.) the best example of this is Philip Pullman's novel "The Tiger In The Well" in which his very strong Victorian heroine Sally Lockhart has everything in her life taken away from her except her baby daughter, and has to fight and hide her way through the slums of London to revenge herself ... While taking care of the little girl. I read this while I was myself the father of a baby, and it was gripping and terrifying. I could identify, but I also saw that her emotions as a mother were distinctly different than mine as a father.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you might findit too stereotypical to introduce the mommy role, and that's fair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306388/#Comment_306388" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T10:58:14+00:00" title="December 30, 2010 10:58AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I think about it, I want the scenario to <i>act like there's nothing whatsoever strange</i> about a bunch of anachronistic women adventurers, just like most scenarios do the same thing with parties of anachronistic male adventurers.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Ara, you say you're confused about my purpose; I'm not sure I have one.

Go for equality, not women are better than men. Give the female and male characters the opportunity to be real people, not just caricatures of real people. Think of women you know in real life that may not have stereotypical gender roles, and do the same with the men (men as caretakers, women as leaders), and assign the characters those occupations or traits. I think some of the best inspiration for feminist stories is Buffy the Vampire slayer. It's not always about the roles the characters play, but the stories they come in contact with. the ability for women characters to be just as interesting and well rounded as the men. Make the story the players engage with decidedly about feminism (or obviously about gender roles) and i think that'll be more interesting than making everyone play women. <br><br>Don't have women take care of babies.

Buffy is a good example of this kind of thing. It's cool, and a worthwhile thing to do. I think that's what you're trying to do, Mathijs.<br/><br/>There's also media that advances a feminist agenda or explicitly addresses or expresses feminist ideas, exploring themes that are relevant to feminist thought. I think "Dollhouse" maybe tried to do this, but it was hella troubling a lot of the time. More successful examples are difficult to find (because the general public reacts to feminism like it killed their kitten), but there are some out there. "Children of Men" for example, can be read as expressing feminist ideas. I think that maybe this isn't what you're trying to do (which is also fine!).<br/><br/>I sometimes find it irritating that media that is merely not sexist is conflated with media that is actively feminist. For example, while I like Joss Whedon's tv shows for the most part, I think that the best he achieves is a show that is somewhat less sexist than most others, most of the time. I'm not sure he deserves the accolades he's recieved for that.<br/><br/>Which is to say, I think that the three criteria you list are very good criteria for creating something that avoids a lot of the sexism inherent in other media. It's a good set of goals. To my mind though, that's not the same thing as creating a feminist work.<br/><br/>That's mostly semantics though.<br/><br/>If I were to write an actively feminist scenario, I would write it about mens' experiences of patriarchy. I'm interested in how power dehumanises both the oppressor and the opressed, in different ways. That's not the only right way to do it though, it's just what I'm interested in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_306423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306423/#Comment_306423" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T16:43:49+00:00" title="December 30, 2010  4:43PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who will play these females?

Something then comes along that challenges this situation - I was thinking a little along the lines of Close Encounters of the Third Kind but instead of the Richard Dreyfus character having the initial first encounter it is his wife.  The Dreyfus character conforms to a stereotype within family life whereby he is orientated to life outside the family - he works and is a breadwinner.  The wife is perhaps more orientated to life inside the family and it is these notions that I think would be interesting for characters and players to explore and question.  <br/><br/>This stereotype has its origin in industrialization and the separation of work life and family life.  Family life has been, via complex social processes ceded to women whereas work life remains the remit of men.  Any problems within family life are then identified as more the woman's responsibility than the man's.  It is also much harder for a woman to leave a family arrangement than a man due to these differences in orientations.  Women are simultaneously seen as powerful organizers of family life and socially degraded.<br/><br/>The other thing I was thinking of was the scene in the first series of Mad Men where Betty Draper visits a psychoanalyst.  Later in the episode the psychoanalyst is seen phoning the husband Don to talk about her 'infantile rage' or something along those lines.  I then got to thinking about<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luce_Irigaray" rel="nofollow">Luce Irigaray's</a> ideas around the phallocentrism of language, an idea I'm interested in, don't understand too well and am not sure whether I agree with.<br/><br/>I appreciate that a lot of people focus on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  I'm not hugely knowledgeable about that canon but I do wonder how Buffy would adapt to family life.<br/><br/>BTW - my notions are informed by having read quite a large number of feminist critiques of family therapy in the last few months.

The scenario would then spend some time making these situations really seem ideal and then BOOM, there would be walls, and the players would have to try and be happy (as there character) while dealing with these preconceived notions and limitations. I think, if presented right, something like this would be both powerful and enlightening.

Playing around with cultural assumptions may produce something interesting. One simple (perhaps simplistic) way to do this is to have the women be from an egalitarian/reverse sexist society, but run into different social attitudes in the course of adventuring. They could also be put in a position to mediate between different social perceptions.<br/><br/>Another, I think more interesting, way is to rethink the adventure itself and center it around domestic and social skills instead of violence. It would be a counterpoint to Magus's point about the degradation of domesticity. Life outside the home, particularly if it's violent, tends to be exalted, and life inside it is considered smaller and less worthwhile. I think it would be fun to challenge that.<br/><br/>I remember reading an awesome HeroQuest AP post a few years ago, set in ancient Ireland. It opened with a grandmother churning butter, and during the session, a (woman) bard ran off would-be cattle raiders from another tribe by threatening to write an insulting song about them. There was no battle in it and the whole thing took place entirely within the village, but it was more interesting than most kill-them-and-take-their-stuff adventures. That's the kind of thing I'm suggesting, a scenario that finds adventure nearby rather than far away and utilizes skills that make sense in particular cultural and community contexts.<br/><br/>I mean, there's nothing new in saying that women can be adventurers just like men can. Of course they can. You can drop women in any place a man can be (reskinning), which is fun and has its own value, but that again exalts life outside the home and the capacity to fight over domesticity and community. The deeper question is the relative social value placed on violence and itinerancy as opposed to a stability and community. Violence is fun, it's simple, it's universal, but it's only useful in certain contexts, on the edges of civilization rather than in the thick of it. Once you get into the home and a stable community, the relative utility of violence tends to drop rather precipitously. Things like communication, reputation, and production skills shoot up in importance.<br/><br/>So my suggestion is to present the players with something that they can't physically fight their way out of: Petty rivalries, an overwhelming adversary that has to be worked around or allied against, winter, a plague, a natural disaster, evacuation, raising a ransom on short notice, pleading or bargaining with an occupying power, heck, maybe even domestic violence if you want to go all out. Any of these problems, and many others, require wits, cooperation, and personal skills rather than brute force. Force can be used, of course, but will probably carry consequences of its own. Along the same lines as Andy's idea, in this case, it may be fun to have one character who actually is or was an itinerant adventurer, for the contrast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_306452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306452/#Comment_306452" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-31T05:56:20+00:00" title="December 31, 2010  5:56AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot to say in my last post that you might want to read 'The Handmaid's Tale' by Margaret Attwood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306565/#Comment_306565" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-02T00:02:23+00:00" title="January  2, 2011 12:02AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>So I'm writing a scenario for Arcon, and I think I might want it to be, well, feminist in tone. Not that I know all the history &amp; meanings of the word "feminism", but here's the basic idea:<br/><br/>- All the characters are women. (This is a way to make up for previous scenarios I've written with weak or non-existent female characters).<br/>- These women are active protagonists, not victims of society.<br/>- The scenario should pass the Bechdel test ((1) it has to have at least two women in it, who (2) who talk to each other, about (3) something besides a man.)<br/><br/>I'm not going to market this as a feminist scenario at the con, but I'd like to have that as a design guideline.<br/><br/>Any thoughts or ideas? Or suggestions for additional guidelines?</blockquote>\nThis sounds fine to me.  As others point out, one can have a game that fits feminist principles without having all-female PCs - but I think the idea of all female PCs is fine.  My games tend to have mixed casts, but I've run all-female and all-male scenarios - like a set of all-male Cimmerian barbarians in "Brawny Thews" or a cast of all-female post-apocalyptic warriors in "Macho Women With Guns".  <br/><br/>One thing to note:  An all-female cast can be interesting, but it isn't necessarily feminist.  It is possible to have storylines which don't particularly push feminist ideals where all the characters are women.  Shows like Designing Women, Desperate Housewives, The Golden Girls, and others feature all-female casts - but often have the female characters act in keeping with conservative stereotypes.  The Bechdel test is a very low bar - and one can have women who are active protagonists who fit anti-feminist stereotypes.  They might have conversations about shopping, fashion, or raising daughters rather than about men.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, I don't think you need to get caught up in labels.  It sounds like you've done a bunch of male-centered games, and as a change of pace you want to do a game with all female PCs.  I think that sounds fine.  <br/><br/>Any preferences for genre or setting?  The rules you give leave the field nearly completely open.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306572/#Comment_306572" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-02T05:08:55+00:00" title="January  2, 2011  5:08AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could ask some women.

And Avshalom's suggestion would be a good exercise to check your initial ideas against. <br/><br/>Other things you might think about are, are you yourself trying to act according to feminist principles in your writing of the scenario or are you wanting the players to deal with issues relating to women and feminism? If the first, then your guidelines seem great. That and keep in mind feedback you get from players, and impressions about the specifics of your design once you write it. And of course, get your impressions from people (men and women) who you feel have a good handle on issues of egalitarianism and ethics toward women, men and women both based on your experience of them. (That's obvious I know!) <br/><br/>If the second, that's a deeper question. I have only a couple quick suggestions. Choose an issue to frontline in the game that relates to women's general experiences. Or put the players into the position in the game of struggling with their own attitudes toward women and relative rights or value with respect to men and in their own intrinsic self.

I've discussed with actual nuns, and they have to ensure their self-reliance in economic terms. In the abbey I visited this involved managing various services such has hostels and tourism, which requires skills in accounting, outreach and management, etc. The nuns there clearly gave the impression of being in charge.<br/><br/>By using nuns, you also have interactions between women and men where the women are often clearly in the superior position, even in historical settings. This would be also true for noble women, of course, but these have other limitations that nuns escape (marriage, child bearing, overbearing male "protection", etc).<br/><br/>As for the kind of scenarios, it can involve political intrigue, even at the royal courts, local politicking \xe0 la Ken Follet, investigation stories as in the name of the rose, assisting judicially the cause of some underprivileged people, or basic charity work as in the case of Calcutta's Mother Teresa.<br/><br/>In contemporary settings, the strength of nuns as characters is that it gives the GM a rock solid justification for the male players to play female characters.<br/><br/>In historical settings, it allows one to play empowered females while retaining credibility. At a time where even rich women often could not travel without a male companion, learn to read and write, or even do business by themselves, nuns had access to all these privileges. Only widows came close to this level of autonomy, and only in societies where widows were not forced to die with their husband, or to joins some cloister, which leads to the same.<br/><br/>Of course, playing nuns has its limitations, but since all player characters would be nuns, it's easy to put off-screen the uninteresting bits (prayer times, etc), just like you don't play sleep during a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/OrangeDice" title="OrangeDice"><img alt="OrangeDice" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/OrangeDice">OrangeDice</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307724/#Comment_307724" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T17:24:26+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  5:24PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>If a bunch of men get together and design a feminist scenario, it's not going to end well.</blockquote>Hah!

I'd play it! <br/><br/>We could have discussion about what "empowered" means in the context of the church and a patriarchal society (or even what it means in general, as I kind of don't know), but I think the broader point is that nuns typically would have had more day-to-day agency within a particular scope of action than many other women of their time. <br/><br/>I think, in fact, that the tension of being reasonably powerful female figures within a larger organisation that is patriarchal and much more powerful would make for interesting play indeed. The combination of great agency within a limited scope, and complete powerlessness outside of that scope could provoke some great stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307734/#Comment_307734" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T20:10:52+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  8:10PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll second the "nuns &amp; sisters".<br/><br/>I've recently been reading about the history of New France, and one character who stands out is <a href="http://home.infionline.net/~ddisse/incarnat.html" rel="nofollow">Marie de l'Incarnation</a>\n<blockquote>In Quebec, Marie found herself far from the lack of "commotion" that she had originally sought in religious life.

The game in question, <i>Draug</i>, is set to Norway in the Napoleonic era. There are few nuns active in the land (a handful of monasteries exist), but there certainly are some women of intelligence and power. I believe you may find such women both in the rural Norway of the time, and in high society. To investigate how they contributed to the Norwegian society of the era, and how they may be portrayed in a game, would be interesting. This is a society where men had legal dominance over women, so to be a woman of influence demanded something extra.<br/><br/>I do not think that is what Matthijs will do in the scenario at hand, however. I believe he has chosen a lighter approach, with <i>feminism</i> more of a slogan for what promise to be an entertaining joy-ride in female characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kate%20Bullock" title="Kate Bullock"><img alt="Kate Bullock" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/369/nDTB5PI7ZR748.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kate%20Bullock">Kate Bullock</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307981/#Comment_307981" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-13T02:39:04+00:00" title="January 13, 2011  2:39AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a feminist, and I don't mean a side-liner feminist (which there's nothing wrong with), I mean a protesting, sign-carting, cheering and marching type of feminist, I strive to run and write a lot of games that could be called more 'feminist' than others. However, there are certain things you need to remember when trying to write a 'feminist' one-shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic ideas you have, I think, are great. The only premise that I'm a little leery about is the one stating they are protagonists, not victims of society. In the modern world, one in three women (in Western society) have been raped or are victims of sexual harassment of some kind. That's modern day statistics. I'm not throwing it out there to be bitter, what I'm trying to say is that while women can be strong, powerful figures, they can still be (and often are) victims of their society. Unless your one-shot takes place in a mythical world unlike our own, which I acknowledge is possible, or takes place in the past before Sumer in a hunter-gatherer society, these women characters are going to have some back-stories that explain how and why they are powerful women.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefine the culture they're in. What's the gender history there? Is it patriarchal? How much? How much status do women have? Can they even have status? If so, then why are these women more exceptional than the average woman? Define the average woman in this society and go from there. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you feel like doing a little outside reading to get a feel for what I'm talking about, check out some Social Construction theories on gender. What the society believes will be greatly reflected upon your heroines. You can treat them the same as men would be treated, then remember your world is gender equal (unlikely, but sure) and make sure all the characters reflect that, both npc and pc. I've played in some games where the world was supposedly gender neutral only to have some sexist comments thrown out by npcs. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone mentioned Buffy as an example. It's a good start. Think about Buffy, she's strong, powerful, but still was a victim of a rape attack, of being used by a guy for sex (and see how that made her feel). Anya was left at the altar, and before then, was a vengeance demon because of something a guy did to her. Willow gets her heart broken by a man that had an affair on her, and then finds fulfillment in another woman. These are all main female characters that have been damaged by the society they're in, by men in their lives, and are still pulling strong and coming out swinging. Our histories matter to us, and we don't usually forget much. So please, don't just take some male characters and slap a female name on them, unless, of course, the world you're running in is tres awesome and has no sexist natures or histories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kleenestar" title="kleenestar"><img alt="kleenestar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.replayable.net/pics/kleenestar.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kleenestar">kleenestar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308047/#Comment_308047" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-13T12:52:57+00:00" title="January 13, 2011 12:52PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First: I am SO with Avshalom. Make awesome characters, then give them female names. If you start to make your female characters interesting because they're struggling with their roles as housewives, or because they're toting a baby, or because they're dealing with sexism, that's just reinforcing the notion that women are identified by doing Womany McWoman things, not by being (say) human beings with the same struggles and drives as everyone else.<br/><br/>Second: damn straight, make all the characters women. If your male players are uncomfortable playing women, take it as a teachable moment. You can show them what it's like to be expected to treat maleness as the norm <i>all the fucking time</i>. Also you are less likely to get players playing to gender roles if the characters are all of the same gender, because humans attend more to contrasts than to homogeneity.<br/><br/>Third: screw historical credibility. <br/><br/>--Jess<br/><br/>PS: This is not to say that I don't agree with Kate in some ways. Kate, personally I would (and do!) use your approach in a long-term game rather than a con-based one-shot, because I don't think you can do the social construction thing justice in just one session with players of, shall we say, highly variable quality. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
