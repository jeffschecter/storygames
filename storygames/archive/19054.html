It's a great way to get things started and allows players creative freedom and a chance to really shine with their creativity. Vincent Bakers Apocalypse World reminds you to ask questions like crazy.  I've heard many strong GM's speak on the concept and the use in their games. Lately I've been taking a few minutes right after character creation to develop questions to ask my players to get the session going.  As I've grown more comfortable with asking questions and developing more from the answers I've learned a great deal about the versatility of this technique for my games.<br/><br/>There are many purposes that questions can have in the asking at the beginning or in the middle of play. These are the ones I've found.<br/><br/>1. Establish setting by players who have more interest in the particulars.<br/><br/>Players may ask about a particular facet of setting that is not described.  It's useful to turn the question back on the player and have them answer since obviously it wasn't something that factored in to my original perception of the setting. If the player is interested in it ask them about it.  If a player is interested where we get our water from in Apocalypse World, ask them.  They may have better ideas than you since they were actively wondering about it.<br/><br/>2. Provide character background and past actions without consent.<br/><br/>Questions imply past action and starting with questions that imply character action and allowing players to explain provides an interesting opportunity to the player.  Asking how a players character how they came to be framed for the death of a prominent NPC is a charged question which allows the player to not only describe how they were involved in the situation, but also certainly puts a story in motion with nothing more than a question. These questions can be all you need for entire campaigns.  When I ask how the players character covered up the murder of their brother I'm past the point of asking if that's something your character would do.  It's been done!  These questions should be carefully administered so as not to violate too much where the player wants their character to be. <br/><br/>3.  Letting players railroad themselves.<br/><br/>I found this little handy tool recently and since I figured this out I've used it to an interesting effect.  I remember one of the most railroady games I ever played in.  The party was on a path.  We were walking down it and the GM refused to let me get off the path.  I asked why and he made up some crappy answer like, "The trees are too thick."  I remember being so irritated because of what was apparently a wall of wood surrounding a path.  I had no agency in my staying on the path. I recently ran an apocalypse world game experiment in railroading.  I wanted to make a path scenario but I wanted to be sneaky about it. I wanted the players to stay in this tunnel system with manholes that they could get out but I wanted to railroad them from using those manholes. I went around the table and asked each player why they were afraid of going above ground. They railroaded themselves into staying in that tunnel with unnamed terrors and they did it to themselves... and... as it turned out... the acid rain that made one of the players not want to leave  combined with some scary sounding creatures that hunted for carrion in the acid were interesting setting set pieces.<br/><br/>4.  Starting in media res.<br/><br/>Why are you running on the rooftops of the royal palace?  Aaaaaaaaaaand adventure ensues.  (This is obviously a game starter or session starter question.) Not only does adventure ensue, but it allows the players to say something cool that they want to be happening to their character.  I think it's often sad that the players aren't always able to control what context their character is in.  This gives them the opportunity to do that.  The trick is to allow enough room for the player to decide what's going on but not be so broad that it's too hard to come up with something.<br/><br/>5. Building cast.<br/><br/>This question is rather tricky actually.  Always provide a name and either a motive or feeling.  Characters in my games are usually too cool for school so I like to use this element to provide some NPC's that are kinda their equal. "Why is Dorgan the only guy in this town who isn't afraid of you?" This creates cast with purpose and character ties.<br/><br/>6. Continuing question chains.<br/><br/>So, Steve's character is running on the rooftops of the palace because he just stole the Queens scepter... because that's what he answered.  So chain the question to the other characters to get them involved.  What snag did one of the characters run into while they were looking out for Steve?  What deal was one of the characters offered to double cross Steve and who was it?  Chain it around the room until there's too much anticipation to see what happens and let it go.  I think it would be possible instead of writing entire modules, to create adventures on a half sheet of paper that just have questions to ask around the room until play takes off. <br/><br/>What other purposes and examples do you have of question asking in your games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Golux" title="Golux"><img alt="Golux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Golux">Golux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425467/#Comment_425467" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T02:29:18+00:00" title="December  8, 2013  2:29AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Using questions to design scenarios.<br/><br/>The Heist (5 player scenario)<br/><br/>Go around the table asking one question per player.

Since I've been running AW like crazy lately, the questions are the hardest part of my job.  Questions mid game are different than start of game questions, but not by a lot.  So I do use this as a launching point for all of my AW games and it REALLY helps in player motivation and in my ability to have things to draw on from the game.\n<blockquote>I like the Heist thing, I think it would work well as long as it's understood that the game will probably revolve around only a few of the answers and neglect the others -- with ten questions, at least two answers are going to be great story-fodder.

That's kinda one of the reasons I want to go around more than once.  After one or two rounds of questions the players start competing with each other to come up with more clever and creative answers.  Sometimes that kind of competition can be constructive.  It's important to give everyone their moment in the spotlight, but then again, that's the job of every GM in every game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
