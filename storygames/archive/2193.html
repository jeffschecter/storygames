                    I scrambled this out on my laptop at work about a week ago, inspired by several posts <i>from this very board...</i><br/>I'm not even really sure if it's playable, and I can't playtest it because there aren't enough people around me to try it with.  I think I may be too close to it, so I thought I'd drop it here and see if anyone had ideas on how to clean it up.<br/>The basic idea is that I wanted a GM-less pick-up game that could be played in about 20 minutes; easy to memorize rules, no messy character creation, pre-designed scenarios, and very tactile and visual organization by way of "play mats."<br/><br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Prince</span></b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Set-up</span><br/>Each player selects a play mat.  These mats have a location for â€œCharacters you believe are friendsâ€ which is colored white, â€œCharacters you believe are enemiesâ€ which is colored black, and a section down the side with each other color, where you place Debt tokens you receive (see below).<br/><br/>The scenario describes the initial friend/enemy relationships.  Mark these with colored tokens in the appropriate areas of your play mat.  There are pre-made scenarios, but it is simple enough to create your own.<br/><br/>You will only use a number of cards equal to the number of players.  For example, if there are 6 players, use the cards 1 through 6.  Set the other cards aside.<br/><br/>Dealer order is determined randomly.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Normal Round</span><br/>First, the Dealer deals one card to each player.  You may look at your own card, but you may not show the card to another player.  It is within the rules to tell another player what your card is, but they do not have to believe you and you can lie.<br/><br/>Starting with the dealer, each player will have a chance to describe an action they are taking.  There is no set order to this, except that the Dealer always goes first.  An action can describe any sort of goal your character is trying to achieve.  You can also choose to oppose the action of another player, or to Assist someone (see below).  This is sort of a free-for-all step; the only limitation is that your action cannot prevent another player from participating in the Power round (see below).<br/><br/>Once actions are determined, the players show their cards to each other simultaneously.  If two actions are opposed, then the player with the highest ranked card wins* â€“ their action succeeds, and they receive two Advantage Points.  The loser's action fails.  If an action is unopposed, then it succeeds, and the player receives only one Advantage Point.<br/><br/>*The only exception is that the 1 will always beat the highest ranked card.  For example, if you are playing with six players, the 1 will only be able to beat the 6.<br/><br/>If your action is an â€œAssist,â€ then you do not have your own action.  Instead, you add your card's rank to the rank of another player's card.  Whether or not the action is successful, you receive one Advantage Point.  Assistance must be determined before the cards are shown.<br/><br/>After the actions are resolved, the next Dealer begins a new round.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Debt</span><br/>If you would like to get another player to take a particular action, then you can offer them a Debt token from a communal pile.  If they take the token, then they must do what they have agreed to.  The token is placed into the colored section of their play mat that corresponds to your color.<br/><br/>Later, that player can force you to take a particular action by spending the Debt token.  If you refuse, then they gain an additional Debt token instead.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Power Round</span><br/>Once each player has been the Dealer, a Power Round begins.  A Power round represents all of the characters coming together in one location to make power-plays against one another, possibly reorganizing the structure of the group.<br/><br/>A Power round works like a normal round, but each Advantage Point you spend adds one to your card's rank.  You can also call in Debts, each adding one to your rank.  These cannot be refused, even by the target of your action.<br/><br/>Only opposed actions net any sort of mechanical result in a Power round.  If you succeed at one, then your rank is increased by one.  If you fail at one, on the other hand, your rank falls by one.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Further Play</span><br/>This game is played in Cycles; a cycle is finished once the Power round is completed.<br/>If you wish to continue using the same scenario, there are a few multi-cycle rules:<br/><br/>All Debts and Advantage Points are carried over to the next cycle.<br/>Enemy and Friend tokens can be reorganized at the will of an individual player.  These don't have any mechanical effect, but the do demonstrate your loyalties.<br/>The player with the highest rank is The Prince (or Princess).  That player can make a single request per cycle which must be followed, and cannot be refused as with Debt-related requests.<br/><br/>The number of cycles which can be played is limited only by the players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And that's it.  Please, ask me questions.  Get my gears on this turning so I can work any issues out, and if you have any comments on something that seems really wild, mention it.  As I said, I'm too close to the rules to see the potential problems that they might introduce; I feel like there is something I may be missing...                </div>

                            Hey Chris,<br/><br/>Interesting. It seems to me there are only two meaningful use for Debt tokens: 1) to force another player to Assist you in an action (or to withhold their Assist from some other player's action), 2) to force the Prince (or Princess) to issue their one unrefusable request to another player (and the unrefusable request issued will be for a player who has no Debt to you to Assist you, or to withhold their Assist from some other player's action). Am I missing anything? <br/><br/>(You can use Debt to force players to withold an announced Assist, right? Debt doesn't have to be used prior to announced actions?)<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

                            I'm going to kind of answer your questions in reverse order.  <br/><br/>Once cards are revealed, you cannot redeem a Debt token.  Basically, you can't spring a debt on someone while both of you are in the middle of doing something.  Any time before the cards are revealed, though, you can try to redeem your debt.<br/><br/>And yes, the main use of redeeming a Debt token <i>is</i> to get someone else to Assist you, although that can backfire if their card's rank is to low.  It's also completely legal to call in a debt the Prince owes you to get him to use the "super-favor" (which needs a better name), and therefore possibly a good way to generate Debt tokens from the Prince.<br/><br/>I ought to note that you can redeem a debt token to get another player to help you in other ways.  Let's say Player A's action is "I'm going to have my minions hack into Paul's bank account, and drain all of his money."  You can redeem a Debt token to force Player B to oppose that action.  If Player B accepts, then his card will oppose Player A's, possibly preventing your character from losing all of his savings, but B will gain an Advantage Point either way.  There is also the possibility that B's card isn't high enough, and his opposition will fail, rewarding A with 2 AP.  If he declines, on the other hand, then you gain an additional Debt token from him, but he can still use his card for whatever action he wishes.<br/><br/>I should probably include an explanation that you can only try to call in one debt per player per round.  Otherwise, the rules for turning down debts don't make much sense; you would be able to generate an arbitrarily large amount of debt by repeatedly hitting up the same character in a single round.                        </div>

I would love to post a dialogue of how I think it would work, but that will have to wait until I get a bit of time away from school.  I'll see what I can manage over the weekend.  It would definitely help people see where I'm trying to go with the game.<br/><br/>As to jump starting the player's imaginations, the "scenarios" I mentioned are supposed to serve that purpose.  They set up the initial conflicts and relationships, and then the players are supposed to run wild with it.  The setting itself is sort of vague in my mind, right now, but it will involve itself heavily with the scenarios.  I had momentarily considered something like what was discussed in the "<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2173&amp;page=1#Item_11" rel="nofollow">Devil Bunny needs a Katamari</a>" thread, but I'm not sure if that would actually work for this; ideally, the imagined events and actions of the characters would have an impact on play greater than "none."                        </div>

                            Also, I want to add that when I said "I'm not sure if it's playable," I didn't mean as Sorensen-esque coyness.

I've tried to include rules that will allow for emergent strategy and game play, but if there emerges something that essentially is a "win" button, then I'll need to fix it.                        </div>

                            Hey Chris,<br/><br/>My one concern at this point is that it doesn't secure player investment in a shared concept of in-game situation and appropriate scale for actions. I imagine a round of action descriptions:<br/><br/>"I'm going to turn on the fax machine."<br/>"I'm going to clone Greta Garbo."<br/>"I'm going to take over the government of Venezuela."<br/>"I'm going to drink the sea."<br/>"I'm going to Assist Rick with turning on the fax machine. Heh."<br/><br/>Nothing is opposed, everyone gets a point of Advantage. Next round:<br/><br/>"I'm going to load paper into the fax machine."<br/>"I'm going to train Garbo in foreign languages and secret killing arts."<br/>"I'm going to invent time travel."<br/>"Yeah, I gotta oppose the invention of time travel. I'm going to disgorge the sea into Venezuela and wash away your lab."<br/>"Awesome! I'm going to Assist with washing away his lab by overnighting a bottle of my urine to his address."<br/><br/>How long does this remain fun?<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

Paul,<br/>Good call.  That's related to the Devil Bunny factor I mentioned earlier, where the narration is incidental to the game, and I'm not so sure that such a disconnect is a good idea.  I'm not sure it's a bad idea, to be honest.  It certainly would be <i>unusual</i>, but that's a far cry from "fun to play."<br/><br/>One thing that might help prevent the situation you describe is that there is an incentive to oppose another player's action.  If you do, and you win, you score 2 AP instead of 1.  The same incentive would also promote taking actions that you believe someone else will oppose, because if they do, the stakes are once again higher.  If your card for the round is the highest rank (i.e. only a 1 could beat you), then you have a strong incentive to participate in an opposed action; you have a really good chance of scoring that extra point.<br/><br/>Then again, that doesn't deal specifically with the issue of investment in the imaginary situation, and I feel like that's important.  There is a fine balance between whatever this game may be and "board/card game," and said investment is probably the deciding factor.  Without investment, it is next to impossible to see what the other players might try to oppose with their actions, and the game could potentially devolve into your situation, in which all actions are independent of one another.  Perhaps an extremely solid scenario, with colorful description and intense built-in conflicts would help?<br/><br/>Anyone have any thoughts on how to get player investment into the shared concept of the in-game situation?                        </div>

                            I think you've got a good start to this. All I have at this point is a suggestion to make the game more complicated by putting in an entirely different chunk of mechanics and then linking them (I prefer complicated). For example, maybe you have a system for "honor" and not honoring debts loses you honor. Get a couple of inter-related cycles like this going, and you can have more focus on what the play is about.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and consider entitling the game Obrigato. This is Portuguese for "Thanks" but can be more literally translated as "Obligated." I noted recently to somebody the similarity between that and the Japanese "arigato" and that I thought the Japanese had probably adopted the Portuguese term. That somebody happened to know both languages to some extent, and confirmed that this was likely.<br/>
<br/>
What's interesting is that the phrases refer to the fact that the person in question is saying that what you have done for them has obliged them to do something for you in return. The phrase "I'm much obliged" has the same meaning, of course. And this is all also related to the ide of Noblesse Oblige, the obligation of nobility to treat their people well, and deal with each other according to custom. Basically these cultures had to do with honor, and doing something for somebody actually could detract from their honor as they were then indebted to the other person. Which is seen as making you less than that person.<br/>
<br/>
You could, in fact, call the beads "obligations" instead of debts.<br/>
<br/>
Just some stray thoughts.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I think you've got a good start to this. All I have at this point is a suggestion to make the game more complicated by putting in an entirely different chunk of mechanics and then linking them (I prefer complicated). For example, maybe you have a system for "honor" and not honoring debts loses you honor. Get a couple of inter-related cycles like this going, and you can have more focus on what the play is about.</blockquote>
That could be interesting.  I'll have to see what can be done in that direction.  In a previous "version" of the game, which basically just existed scribbled down in a notebook and half in my head, I had considered a set of rules to represent the support the character had from non-player characters.  Perhaps I can intertwine the two ideas, instituting some sort of tracker for status that can be influenced by honor.<br><br>edit to add:<br>I'm wondering though, if this is a good place for the "fruitful void" to be.  As a game about dirty politics and power-grabs, I wonder if it would be better to leave the assessment of "honorable/dishonorable" up to the players, and any fallout from such actions would simply be resolved by the players themselves.
<blockquote>Oh, and consider entitling the game Obrigato. This is Portuguese for "Thanks" but can be more literally translated as "Obligated." I noted recently to somebody the similarity between that and the Japanese "arigato" and that I thought the Japanese had probably adopted the Portuguese term. That somebody happened to know both languages to some extent, and confirmed that this was likely.<br><br>What's interesting is that the phrases refer to the fact that the person in question is saying that what you have done for them has obliged them to do something for you in return. The phrase "I'm much obliged" has the same meaning, of course. And this is all also related to the ide of Noblesse Oblige, the obligation of nobility to treat their people well, and deal with each other according to custom. Basically these cultures had to do with honor, and doing something for somebody actually could detract from their honor as they were then indebted to the other person. Which is seen as making you less than that person.<br><br>You could, in fact, call the beads "obligations" instead of debts.<br><br>Just some stray thoughts.<br><br/>Mike</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>
That could be interesting.  To be honest, the current name (The Prince) was just something I came up with when I posted it here, so I could reference it more easily.  I want the name to express the focus of the game, and the Debt system is one of the most central set of mechanics.  I'll have to see what comes of the game before I settle on a final name for it, but that could be a ways off.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            I think this game looks interesting and it's a shame that we can't test it any time soon.  <br/>
<br/>
My only suggestion is that I think if there are going to be six players, then you should use 7 cards and put one in the discard pile and no one can look at it.  To me, it adds another strategical element. And for a political game, it seems like maybe it would help with the intrigue and out-thinking your opponent elements.  Because the person who has the highest card (number 7 for a 6 player game) can be beat by the person who has card one.  But if there is one extra card that's been discarded, then number 7 just might be unbeatable.   <br/>
<br/>
I don't know if that is anything that you want to consider.  But think it might be cool.  Plus, Citadels is, by far, my favorite card game and this game reminds me of it a little.  It's Citadels, the RPG!                        </div>
