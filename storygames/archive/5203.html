I wanted a game in which the more time travelers messed with the past, whether they were intentionally trying to create paradox or not, the closer they got to all of time collapsing. Since the bulk of my previous design experience had been with <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16200" rel="nofollow">Dread</a>, I was naturally looking at Jenga as a model for that sort of arc--the gradual building of uneasiness followed by a sudden and visceral collapse. Ultimately, I wanted my game to feel more like a puzzle and less like a roller-coaster, so I changed my tack to a more sudoku-inspired resolution; but I think there is definitely merit to the Jenga route.<br/><br/>Were you thinking of a game where everything the characters did in the past could cause paradox (like in "A Sound of Thunder") or would they only risk paradox if they tried to do something specifically against the grain of history as we know it (like helping the Kansas City Chiefs win the first Super Bowl)? In other words, would the players be pulling from the tower for most actions, or just the really big ones? The Jenga is a unpredictable tool, but I can tell you, from practical experience, that it usually takes about 45 pulls to put the tower at risk. Some towers fall much faster and some towers seem invulnerable. But you can sort of use that number as a benchmark in relation to how dramatically close to destroying all of reality you want the characters to get. For example, Dread is designed to have risk the life of at least one character per every 3-4 hour session--so it is built around 45-60 pulls per session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117495/#Comment_117495" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-02T11:57:59+00:00" title="January  2, 2008 11:57AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now that you suggest it, a Dread time travel game sounds perfect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
