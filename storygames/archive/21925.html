                    After a couple of expeditions in Antarctica, I started reading more about the past endeavors in the exploration of that wonderful continent. After some interesting findings, I wrote down this very simple game for 4-6 players about being stranded and facing certain death at the South Pole.<br/><a href="https://starfishgames.itch.io/hearts-in-antarctica-scott-edition" rel="nofollow">https://starfishgames.itch.io/hearts-in-antarctica-scott-edition</a><br/>Would you be interested in reading it?<br/><br/>-MikeT                </div>

                            I read it quickly. I am thinking about ten candles and the way you could time using thawing ice cube, or crush them with your teeth out of spite, but that is too "bretzel". <br/>I'd say the Playing the game part could be edited with distinct paragraphs or fonts for procedure and definitions. There are a few typos (strength).<br/>I have no idea of the game without experiencing it. I think I don't need to be creative, the scenarios take care of that part. I just need to clench my teeth and brood. Do the economy of beads help with that ? Like I trusted my bead to a player who didn't make good use of it or something? I don't think there is this tactical layer. So why the beads ? Why do I care about pardonning the leader if we're going to die ?                         </div>

I guess I can fix them, yes.

The game is not really about any kind of tactical thinking. Everything is tied to <b>your personal feelings</b> as a player AND character about what happened: this means that, knowing that you are going to die soon, you can choose whether to die full of spite or with a free soul. It's not really a "game" in the sense that you have something to score.<br/><br/>-MikeT<br/><br/> </div>
