                    So after a lifetime of playing "traditional" RPGs, I'm preparing to be Story Guide for a The Shadow of Yesterday Campaign in a few weeks.  The social contract will be fairly traditional in order to ease the transition to the new style of play (eg. player narration and scene framing will be an option rather than an expectation).<br/><br/>I've been reading bits and pieces of the Forge, and have subscribed to various Forge-diaspora blogs over the last few months, so I'm fairly dialed in to what this style fo play is supposed to be about (Story now, fun now, tough choices, conflicts that move the story forward regardless of whether the PCs win or lose a conflict), but there are a couple of things I wouldn't mind getting some advice or confirmation on from more experienced hands.<br/><br/>The big one is about using Flags effectively as part of the game.  I can see several ways that I can use them, and I was wondering if some of you would mind offering feedback about which are good, which ones aren't, and which ones I've overlooked totally.  While I'm primarily looking for TSoY specific advice (the systems for what Flags do seems to vary a fair amount from game to game), more general discussion is fine.
<ol>
<li>At the start of the campaign, take a flag from each of the players, and try to weave them together into a start-of-game bang that has a bit of something for each of the players.  This seems like the best way of getting all of the players engaged right away, but could be impractical when playing with a larger group.</li>
<li>During play, when I'm at a loss about how to crank up the tension (per <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=nqi8b2igmun6rn74lsvpq065k2&amp;topic=1361.msg12877#msg12877" rel="nofollow">Paul Czege's</a> advice), grab a flag from one of the character's that is in the current scene, and add a twist that plays to that Flag.  Seems like a reasonable technique, provided I'm quick on my feet.</li>
<li>If a player seems to be losing interest in the current story line, add a new element that plays to one of his flags.</li>
</ol>
When I thinking about starting up this topic, it seemed like I had more ideas than that, so I imagine I'm missing some fairly obvious ideas here.<br/><br/>So what do the "pros" have to say?                </div>

<blockquote>Talk it over with them. Look at their Keys and say, "Looks like this is going to be a game about X..." and get their feedback.</blockquote>
I like that.  One small question.  When I say the game is about x, am I talking premise (my guess is no, since that smacks of railroading) or just a general concept like "go after badguys" or "try to overthrow the corrupt warlord."
<blockquote>And hopefully the conflicts will have consequences that will also add tension. Setting solid stakes will help with this.</blockquote>
Yeah, I've come across this rule of thumb before.  I was actually thinking of something like drawing a Flag into a conflict from out of the blue (more or less) as a part of the stakes that we're setting.
<blockquote>Or ask them if their Keys are working for them. I've had players take Keys that sounded good in theory but kind of sucked in play. If a player goes half the game without collecting any XP from a Key, they might want to go for a buyoff.</blockquote>
Thanks, that one's gold.  I don't know if I would have thought of that on my own.<br/><br/>EDIT: fixed a couple typos                        </div>

                            To take Judd's point a bit further, you've got characters with the Key of Conscience, Key of Justice, and Key of Redemption.<br/>
<br/>
Some of your Bangs for the character with the Key of Conscience need to offer a desirable choice that involves ignoring Conscience.<br/>
<br/>
Some of your Bangs for the character with the Key of Justice need to offer a desirable choice that involves committing an injustice.<br/>
<br/>
Some of your Bangs for the character with the Key of Redemption need to offer a desirable choice that involves turning away from the path of Redemption.<br/>
<br/>
Flags are big, red, glowing signs that tell you and the other players to test and challenge this character over his belief or ideal.<br/>
<br/>
This is my sig for the Burning Wheel boards. Burning Wheel uses Beliefs as flags, but substitute Key for Belief and this should work fine:<br/>
<br/>
"Here's a rule of thumb you can use. When a player gives you a Belief, you should be able to say to yourself: "Oh REALLY?! Let's see if you still believe that if THIS happens.""<br/>

                            Here's how I'll be doing things for the Burning Wheel game we're starting:<br/><br/>1) Nail down a central idea ("Warring States China, peaceful kingdom about to fall into war, one of the generals is a traitor")<br/>2) Players build characters as a group, playing off that idea and each other's Flags<br/>3) I prep a bunch of NPCs designed to hit on the player's Flags, either conflicting or supporting them.<br/>4) I make a reference sheet- on one column, all the PCs, their Flags (Beliefs, Instincts, Traits, Relationships, etc.  For you, it'd be Keys).

If I get stuck, I'll scan down both lists and try to see if I can connect 2 or 3 characters either in conflict or common motivations and put them into a scene together.  Basically- all the NPCs either want to help, harm, or use the PCs, pick one or more NPCs, and play them like you would a PC.<br/><br/>We finished step 2 last night, so now I have to apply step 3 and 4 by next week, and we're good to go.                        </div>

No problem.  Isn't making shit up what role-playing is all about <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>
<blockquote>So, one guy has the Key of Concience and another has the Key of Justice and another has the Key of Redemption.<br/><br/>You look 'em over and say, "Wow, looks like a group of real do-gooders, trying to make the world a better place. What do you guys think?"<br/><br/>You aren't telling them what the game is going to be about but looking at their Keys and looking for some kind of commonality.</blockquote>
Aha!  This is much clearer, and very helpful.  Thanks Judd.<br/><br/>(As an aside, for the benefit of those of you who haven't clicked through to my profile, I'm Gerald)
<blockquote>One person has the Key of Law and another has the Key of the Rebel, you mention that they will probably be conflicting.</blockquote>
Here I have a couple of follow up questions.<br/><br/>Will the system tend to drive this conflict to formal, rolling dice against each other conflicts, or will it tend more towards the players wanting to stay away from each other (in the game world) and pursue their own goals seperately? This seems important both as a part of educating the players and for the sake of proper preparation as the Story Guide.<br/>Should I explain as part of the presentation of the game that this kind of player Key conflict is a viable option for play (obviously it is), but should be agreed to by all players, or should I wait until I see it as a possibility before I bring it up? When I point it out, how big a deal should I make of it?
<blockquote>Does that make sense?</blockquote>
Yes, for the most part.  Thanks.<br/><br/>From eddy
<blockquote>I skimmed this, and for a moment I was thinking of football flags.</blockquote>
Hehe, I thought about adding an explanation of Flags for my fellow n00bs, but decided to omit it for the sake of brevity.<br/><br/>From Thor
<blockquote>"Here's a rule of thumb you can use. When a player gives you a Belief, you should be able to say to yourself: "Oh REALLY?! Let's see if you still believe that if THIS happens.""</blockquote>
Yeah, I've seen some of Ron's posts over on the Forge about "So you believe that, huh? Do you believe it now? How about now?" Your comments brought how to do that in practice into a sharper focus, though. Thanks.<br/><br/>One question. The obvious way of doing this is putting the character's Key (Belief, etc.) in conflict with traditional morality, but does playing two of a character's Keys in conflict with each other work at creating tension in actual play?<br/><br/>BTW, this also helps give the buying off Keys rules better context.  Cool <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>From bankuei
<blockquote>1) Nail down a central idea ("Warring States China, peaceful kingdom about to fall into war, one of the generals is a traitor")</blockquote>
Basically done.  I'm running a fairly abstracted setting that takes the core idea of Near (former domain that was dominated by a great empire, decimated by a moon-creating impact), but I've dropped most of Clinton's actual setting stuff like the cultures, preferring to leave it more abstracted, leaving it to be developed concretely in play.  Basically I wrote up a 1-pager intro that I'll e-mail to the players before we get together for step 2.
<blockquote>2) Players build characters as a group, playing off that idea and each other's Flags</blockquote>
I thought I understood the imprtance of this before, but this thread has brought it more clearly into focus.
<blockquote>3) I prep a bunch of NPCs designed to hit on the player's Flags, either conflicting or supporting them.</blockquote>
This is useful.  While I think I had the general idea, I was focusing more in terms of antagonists (EDIT - that is, I was mostly thinking in terms of antagonists for pre-prep.  Obviously friends, etc. are important during play). Just to help clarify a bit, though, would you mind offering a concrete example of an NPC that supports a Key?  While the need to flesh out a True Love, or even a victim NPC that can be the trigger for a player with the Key of  Justice, but how about an NPC that supports, say, Key of the Imposter?<br/><br/>Actually, if you want to do an example from your Burning Wheel campaign, that should be fine.  I haven't read the game, but I'm pretty sure I know enough about it that it should work okay.
<blockquote>4) I make a reference sheet- on one column, all the PCs, their Flags (Beliefs, Instincts, Traits, Relationships, etc. For you, it'd be Keys). On another column, I put the NPCs and their "Flags".</blockquote>
Cool.  I can definitely see how this helps.
<blockquote>5) In play, I'll frame scenes based on which Flags seem the most pressing and interesting. If I get stuck, I'll scan down both lists and try to see if I can connect 2 or 3 characters either in conflict or common motivations and put them into a scene together. Basically- all the NPCs either want to help, harm, or use the PCs, pick one or more NPCs, and play them like you would a PC.</blockquote>
Again, I think I've seen posts that imply this, but seeing a simple, clear explanation of technique is <em>really</em> useful.<br/><br/>This thread has already been far more informative than I expected.

                            Don't forget Secrets! Those are Flags, too. Generally they're of the "I want this cool stuff to happen" variety.<br/>
<br/>
And here's a tip about setting stakes: talk about clear results and consequences, not just events.<br/>
<br/>
- <b>"If you lose, he gets away"</b> is a decent stake, but not a great one.<br/>
<br/>
- <b>"If you lose, he gets away <i>and kills the Duke</i>"</b> is better, in my opinion. There's a concrete consequence attached to the conflict. Consider Vincent's awesome example from Dogs with your brother and the shopkeeper's wife.                        </div>

<em>When I say the game is about x, am I talking premise (my guess is no, since that smacks of railroading) or just a general concept like "go after badguys" or "try to overthrow the corrupt warlord."</em><br><br>You are most absolutely talking premise, which you most absolutely <em>should be doing</em>.  First of all, you are a participant in the game, even if you're the GM, and the premise should be interesting to you in some way, shape, or form.  You aren't doing this as a favor for your friends, you're doing this because it's fun.  For you, as well as them.<br><br>What you aren't doing, and most assuredly should not do, especially in preplay, is <em>addressing premise</em>, which is sort of like answering the question posed by the premise.  It's the difference between saying "Looks like you're a bunch of do-gooders, wandering around trying to do good," and "Looks like you're a bunch of do-gooders, wandering around trying to do good, <em>which is exactly the correct thing to do and you would therefore be "right" in your playing of this game</em>."  See the difference?  Talking about the premise is great; setting up the questions is great.  Answering those questions before you even start roleplaying kind of defeats the purpose of playing in the first place.<br><br><em>Will the system tend to drive this conflict to formal, rolling dice against each other conflicts, or will it tend more towards the players wanting to stay away from each other (in the game world) and pursue their own goals seperately? ... <br/>Should I explain as part of the presentation of the game that this kind of player Key conflict is a viable option for play (obviously it is), but should be agreed to by all players, or should I wait until I see it as a possibility before I bring it up? When I point it out, how big a deal should I make of it?</em><br/><br/>Depends on how you and your players want to play it.  <em>Talk to them</em> and ask if they're comfortable with PvP conflicts or not.  If they are, it's relatively trivial to set up conflicts where one player is on one side and another player is on another side.  (His sister killed a man and you're the law in town.  What do you do?)<br/><br/>If they are not comfortable with PvP conflicts... well, you can try and set up conflicts where they'll be on the same side -- but in so doing, you are coming very close to deciding which side of the conflict is right and which isn't.  (If that doesn't make sense, say so and I or someone else can clarify.)  This is something to talk over with your players, as the question of PvP versus no PvP will determine large swaths of how your game will play out.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi,<br/><br/>Support Key of the Imposter?  Easy- mistaken identities is a classic way of starting good drama.  "I'm the famous doctor from the East!" (wink wink).   "Oh, doctor, there's a special case you have to attend to.  Um, the King has an... illness of which we cannot speak and no one can know about.  If you could cure it you'd be well rewarded..."<br/><br/>As far as my game, we've got a PC with the Belief, "Treat your enemies with respect"- which is easily enough to build NPCs with, since a major part of the Warring States stories deals heavily with honorable and dishonorable folks on any given side of a struggle, so naturally there's got to be at least one adversary who's a really stand up guy, and one who's truly dispicable.  But that aside, I'm also going to make an ally who <i>abuses</i> his foes, cruelly, brutally, and unnecessarily- because that also plays off this one Flag.<br/><br/>When it comes to my Flags to Framing method, it's real easy to work with because the players have built their PCs and Flags, and I've built all my NPCs to "fit" with those, like puzzle pieces. <br/><br/>For example, using that PC, I know I can frame him in any scene with an enemy and things will get interesting.  The honorable foe supports his flag, the dishonorable foe challenges it, and the brutal ally also challenges it.  If, they capture the honorable enemy and then the ally starts torturing and humiliating him, what does the PC do?  I don't know, but I know it will be interesting.<br/><br/>Likewise, if any of the other PCs have flags that might link to the situation, or be at cross odds, then things start getting more interesting.  One player has, "Win at any cost", so what happens if he's convinced torture IS a good way to go for victory?<br/><br/>The key to this is to think about it like you would an episode of Jerry Springer, what groups of people can you put together that will result in chairs getting thrown?  Or, for a deeper tradition, this shows up in Greek tragedy and Shakesphere- you already know that once Oedipus isn't killed, it's only setting things up to get totally fucked up.<br/><br/>When framing scenes, don't think, "How can I convince the player to take his/her character to X location", ask yourself what plausible situation/location you could expect these PCs to be at, and the NPCs can also be at, and frame it from there.  Like above, I could fret and fuss about how to make sure the enemy gets captured and not killed, or, I could just frame that someone else captured him and now they're at his jail cell.<br/><br/>Once you know which characters ought to go together, and have a general idea of how it could happen- just scene frame it and see what happens.                        </div>

                            Here's an example from the last session I ran:<br/>
<br/>
Player 1 has Key of Conscience<br/>
<br/>
Player 2 has Key of the Quest<br/>
<br/>
Player 3 has Key of the Rebel<br/>
<br/>
Player 4 just found out her family is born from a long line of witches.<br/>
<br/>
They come upon a big city and they need to get provisions and horses and all of that adventure-y shit.  The guy with the Key of the Quest tells everyone in no uncertain terms that they are in the city to get in and get out, even though the player knows damned well that isn't going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
As they come into the city, I describe a woman chained to a cart who is said to be  a witch and will be burned at the stake.<br/>
<br/>
And the Rebel, rebels and the Conscience goes soft at how helpless she is and the character who just found out about her witchy heritage, her eyes go big.<br/>
<br/>
I hit every Key in one stroke.  Everyone was doing something and in a hurry.<br/>
<br/>
It rocked.<br/>

Hope that helps.                        </div>

                            Okay, this thread has kind of exploded on me (in a good way), so I'm going to spread my replies out over a few posts for clarity's sake.<br/><br/>From John
<blockquote>Don't forget Secrets! Those are Flags, too. Generally they're of the "I want this cool stuff to happen" variety.</blockquote>
I was going to mention this in the initial post, but then stuck with the generic term Flags.  I'd count Abilities as Flags, too, for similar reasons as Secrets. A bit lower on the immediate cool quotient, but that's where narration comes in.
<blockquote>And here's a tip about setting stakes: talk about clear results and consequences, not just events.</blockquote>
I've caught on to this before, although it may end up being the hardest aspect of stakes setting to keep in mind for the first while, since it's not something I can manage in prep, it has to be developed into a reflex through play.<br/><br/>Joshua says
<blockquote>You are most absolutely talking premise, which you most absolutely should be doing. First of all, you are a participant in the game, even if you're the GM, and the premise should be interesting to you in some way, shape, or form.</blockquote>
Okay, I understand where you're coming from.  I can't give the story my best if I'm not interested in the underlying issues/storyline.
<blockquote>What you aren't doing, and most assuredly should not do, especially in preplay, is addressing premise, which is sort of like answering the question posed by the premise. It's the difference between saying "Looks like you're a bunch of do-gooders, wandering around trying to do good," and "Looks like you're a bunch of do-gooders, wandering around trying to do good, <em>which is exactly the correct thing to do and you would therefore be "right" in your playing of this game.</em>" See the difference? Talking about the premise is great; setting up the questions is great. Answering those questions before you even start roleplaying kind of defeats the purpose of playing in the first place.</blockquote>
I assume you chose such a blunt example for purely educational purposes, right? <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I see what you're saying.  Basically I misunderstood where the railroad tracks actually start with this.  As my last post probably shows, i'm more likely to err on the other side of this - not asking about issues explicitly enough.
<blockquote>If they are not comfortable with PvP conflicts... well, you can try and set up conflicts where they'll be on the same side -- but in so doing, you are coming very close to deciding which side of the conflict is right and which isn't. (If that doesn't make sense, say so and I or someone else can clarify.)

Cool.<br/><br/>Thor answered:
<blockquote>Oh man! Does it ever. That's some of the juiciest play material you'll ever see.

Good.  I was just a little worried that this sort of conflict would tend to make player's not care so much since they get XP either way.  The choice becomes reward-neutral.                        </div>

Hmmmmm......so basically, let the player choose a disguise/false identity, then throw it back at him by having someone buy into it more than the player wants. Seems reasonable, but how is this a case of using a pre-defined character to support the Key?  I'm not trying to be obtuse here, it just looks more like fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants GM opportunism.
<blockquote>I could fret and fuss about how to make sure the enemy gets captured and not killed, or, I could just frame that someone else captured him and now they're at his jail cell.</blockquote>
And there's another one of those bits of wisdom that I have seen before, but gets snapped into perfect focus through a simple, straightforward statement that I have been loving in this thread.  Thanks Chris.<br/><br/>From Judd
<blockquote>Hope that helps.</blockquote>
It does, a lot.<br/><br/>As a side note, I discovered The Forge's advanced Search function today, So rather than trying to wade through umpteen pages of Actual Play posts for TSoY threads, I got a couple screenfuls worth.

Yep.  I think that was in the first thread I saw on the topic of Flags.  Thanks, though.

I'll definitely try that.

<a href="http://bankuei.blogspot.com/2005/12/in-plain-words.html" rel="nofollow">Is this the thread folks were looking for?</a><br/><br/>"GM opportunism"?  You're giving them what they want, not screwing them over <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/><br/>Players show up to the table not knowing what's going to happen, but they improvise just fine- is it opportunism?  Of course not, it's them improvising, as guided by their character concepts and the focus of the game.  What we've missed out on is giving GM's the same tools and techniques so that they, too, can improvise just as well without having to write every possible event down.<br/><br/>The players look to their character sheets- you look to your list of NPCs and the players' Flags, and you improvise from there.<br/><br/>When the player has the Key of the Imposter, they're saying they want situations where they can take fake identities, so you set up a group of NPCs and situations where it'll be easy, enticing, and FUN to do just that.  It's just like when a player in D&amp;D takes a Rogue and loads up on trap skills- they want to encounter some traps, so you give it to them.  Here, you should take the other Keys in play, and make lots of "openings" for that player to jump in.  <br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>The PCs stumble upon a dead man, having encountered some terrible misfortune upon the road.  He's carrying official documents identifying him as the tax collector.<br/><br/>A particular merchant family always bribes the tax man so they don't pay quite as much as they should- in fact, they aren't afraid to brag about what a smart business practice it is.  The other folks in the community, though, are the ones who end up paying higher taxes so the tax man can make the quota.<br/><br/>The Conscience player might be concerned about reporting the dead man (but also concerned about the community and it's problems), the Justice player obviously is going to be torn on this as well, and then the Imposter has room to present himself off AS the tax man.<br/><br/>The whole problems and situation of the community, the NPCs, you've got that set up beforehand, though there needs to be about 3 more subplots of problems going on so that even if the players pass this one over, there's probably another one they'll find grabby.<br/><br/>Set up 3-4 nasty conflicts, interwined between the various NPCs (and/or NPCs to PCs) and have all the NPCs trying to hurt, help, or use the PCs and triggering their Flags.  All of it together is the equivalent of your GM's "character" sheet- when you don't know what to do next, you look at all the problems you've set up, the NPCs, and you figure out how to make things interesting.  Players look at their sheets and try to figure out what skills or abilities they might be able to use- you look at yours and try to figure out what NPCs, conflicts, and scenes you can put together.                        </div>

                            Here's an example of a "GM's sheet" for my forthcoming game, <i>Stranger Things.</i> It was developed partly from Chris's prep for his ST playtest, so it captures some of the things he mentions above, like having 3 NPCs and their problems ready to go right through the PCs.<br/>
<br/>
<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ma/st_dreamsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">Dream Sheet</a> (PDF 55kb)<br/>
<br/>
Everything on this sheet is a flag. The player fills out parts of it, then the GM fills in the rest and reveals it in play. When it's time to frame a scene for that Stranger (PC), this sheet is the GM's menu of tasty treats.<br/>
<br/>
A similar thing could be arranged for TSOY, linking NPCs to Keys and Secrets and then funneling the NPCs desires through the PCs.                        </div>

Maybe opportunism wasn't the best word for what I meant <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I meant it fairly literally, as in seeing an opportunity and running with it, not GM-trying-to-get-the-players crap.<br><br>LOVED the tax collector example.

I'm going to take a look at the sample pages for ST, too, for a bit of context.<br/><br/>Unless someone thinks that there's something important that I haven't thought to ask about, I think I'm about questioned out on this subject, at least until I get a chance to actually play.  I'd like to thank you all again for your responses and patience.  Definitely above and beyond the call of duty.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
