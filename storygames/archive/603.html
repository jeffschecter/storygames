                    The discussion thread on whether or not D&amp;D magic is technology or not has gotten well beyond its original topic, so I thought I might kick off a whole new thread proper.  Heck, while I'm at it, I'll spin it towards my own curiosity with a few organizing questions.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the term 'magic' is a big tent word--it gathers together all manner of disparate ideas beneath its category.  I would even suggest that this is where its strength lies, in the productive ambiguity it leaves open.  Here are some questions I hope will help explore that tent (please answer one or more):<br/>
<br/>
1. What games have magic mechanics that feel 'magical' to you?  Why? <br/>
<br/>
2. What games have magic mechanics that don't feel 'magical' to you? Why?<br/>
<br/>
3. What do those answers that tell us about what you think of as magical?<br/>
<br/>
4. Does presence or absence of that 'magical-ness' hamper you enjoyment of the game?                </div>

<i><b>1. What games have magic mechanics that feel 'magical' to you? Why?</b></i><br/><br/>The magic in that Fudge Magical Medley book. Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium. Kult. Pendragon (!)<br/>(note: I've never played Ars Magica, so I can't make claims on that one)<br/><br/><b><i>2. What games have magic mechanics that don't feel 'magical' to you? Why?</i></b><br/><br/>Most games where magic could do just about anything (most generic systems like GURPS, Masterbook, etc included). D&amp;D, etc. <br/><br/>MAGE sorta straddled feeling magical and non-magical to me. <br/><br/><i><b>3. What do those answers that tell us about what you think of as magical?</b></i><br/><br/>Internal consistency. It doesn't have to make sense, but it should be cohesive. It may or may not have "rules" it follows, but if it doesn't it still maintains a sense of certain effects. Magic where it can do anything (from scrying to healing to fireballs) without a great background explanation and background cohesiveness usually kills the "magicness" (not the playability, mind you: I can still hang with my firball-throwing magic ball-using necromancer kung fu adept, but his magic smells like Fiat and not Magic).<br/><br/><b><i>4. Does presence or absence of that 'magical-ness' hamper you enjoyment of the game?</i></b><br/><br/>Hmmm. Having that cohesion definitely adds a level of immersion into the game world. Being able to know as a player "Magic here works like that!" or "Magic doesn't work like that!" helps flesh out those elements of the campaign background.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>Oooh!  Ooooohh!  I wanna answer too!</p>
<p><strong><em>1. What games have magic mechanics that feel 'magical' to you? Why?</em></strong></p>
<p>Mage (2nd Ed) was super-magical to me.  In somewhere between two and a half and three years of weekly games, I don't think an effect was ever repeated.  Not once.</p>
<p><strong><em>2. What games have magic mechanics that don't feel 'magical' to you? Why?</em></strong></p>
<p>Hmm... I'd have to say pretty much every other game I've ever played with magic as part of the sytem.  In order of least-magical to most magical, I'd say; Shadowrun, d20 D&amp;D, AD&amp;D, Call of Cthulhu, Vampire, and Werewolf.</p>
<p><strong><em>3. What do those answers that tell us about what you think of as magical?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well, I can't say what it tells you, but it tells me that I like an "ooooooh"-factor to my magic.</p>
<p><strong><em>4. Does presence or absence of that 'magical-ness' hamper you enjoyment of the game?</em></strong></p>
<p>Not even a little bit.</p>

<b>1. What games have magic mechanics that feel 'magical' to you? Why? </b><br/><br/>This question makes me shudder to the very bottom of my soul. None the less, I will be a good netizen and try to answer it. <br/><br/><i>Tribe 8</i>: Synthesis, as of 1st edition at least, was a magic system I could get behind. It had a focus on lucid dream feeling and ritual that gave reasons for shamanic dream ritual and associative imagery to build magic. Quite nice. It also gave many people fits, as it wasn't specified enough for many groups. <br/><br/><i>Pendragon 4th Edition</i>: It's a tad bit Crystal Cave, perhaps, but the emphasis on the price of magic, the direct correlation between religion and magic, magic and focal space, and magic and holy days gives a very good new-age Celty magic feeling that fits the game's tone perfectly. Well, at least as you keep magic to NPCs, magician NPCs in a knightly group face serious issues. <br/><br/><i>Ars Magica</i>: Because when you say "magic" I don't always think "dreamy shamanic non-realism" and sometimes think "science with a different paradigm." Ars isn't perfect, but it does a good enough job of mocking up a hermetic science POV on magic that the game rules and the feeling of the magic work to support each other. If you're looking less for Starhawk and more for Iamblichus of Apamea (and want a brutally heavy Sim system) then Ars is nice. <br/><br/><b>2. What games have magic mechanics that don't feel 'magical' to you? Why?</b><br/><br/>Games where the magic is just assumed, without any thought given into how it works together with the system to create a feeling -- whatever the feeling. So GURPS and D&amp;D magic don't feel all that magical, as they aren't really about creating a magical feeling. In D&amp;D they're about having nifty cool ways to overcome challanges (cool, but not magical feeling to me) and in GURPS... well in GURPS I'm not sure what they are. <br/><br/>Oh, probably RIFTS should be mentioned too. Not because I hate Rifts, but because it does the other thing in the "not magical magic" that I see -- it has magic as superpowers. Which, you know, there is a lot of literary and folk loric support for, but it doesn't hit my personal feeling of "magical." Superpowers are nifty neat, and being able to list your source as magic is cool as well, but it doesn't make me think "magical." <br/><br/>OTOH, just being rules heavy and having well deliniated systems doesn't ruing the feeling of magic for me -- as many RW magical belief structures have the most brutally deliniated and "rules heavy" systems you can possible imagine. I do, however, need the game to do something congruous with the magic it is wanting to represent for the system heaviness to work for me. (As in my Ars example.) <br/><br/><b>3. What do those answers that tell us about what you think of as magical?</b><br/><br/>Things that have an internal logic that is at odds with the internal logic of the modern paradigm of scientific rationalism, I suppose.  And/Or religious beliefes in which the religious outlook is held to be capable of effecting change in the tangible world by effecting the liminal levels of human experience. <br/><br/><b>4. Does presence or absence of that 'magical-ness' hamper you enjoyment of the game?</b><br/><br/>Not unless the "feeling magical" is the point of the game. I love me some D&amp;D wizards, because I'm not (these days) playing D&amp;D to feel magical. I frequently play super-mages in M&amp;M or WGP, and don't feel at all let down when their magic is just a different flavor for their superpower. But if I were to play a game of The Spiral Dance, then having magic that works off a logic like that of Joseph Edamaruku may irk me.                        </div>

                            "Magic," for me, works by association rather than causality.  It's not a matter of A affects B to accomplish C -- that's science, and the "real world" -- it's a matter of A is like B and therefore C.  The bridge is made of wood, the stick I hold in my hand is wood, I break the stick and the bridge collapses.  That's magic.<br/><br/>My poster children for this kind of thinking is <em>Tribe 8</em> Synthesis and <em>Mage: the Ascension</em> (2nd ed).  In Synthesis, you have two words called Eminences and you can tap into the flow of the River of Dream to bring the supernatural power of that realm into the one you live in, and do so in accordance with those two Eminences.  So if I have the word Truth, I can make you tell the truth, but I can also move firelight to reveal hidden things.  In play, this piles just boatloads of significance on your Eminences, and you build up a good sense of an associative network of how the entire world relates to your Eminences rather than it being a big uncaring Newtonian pinball machine.  <em>Mage</em> does this, too, just not as well.<br/><br/>For counter examples, anything with a spell list ranks pretty highly up there, if only because a spell list presents a list of options which all have discrete requirements and effects.  This format frames magic in the cause-and-effect framework of science and the real world.  It builds up no meaning or significance, it's just technology by other means.  Now, that can be <em>fun</em>, certainly -- building an address out of different abilities can be an enjoyable tactical exercise -- but it's the sideline, insignificant in terms of the thematic content of the game.  When playing like this, it's your own character's cleverness that's important, not their relationship with Truth or Vengeance.  It's just a different kind of game.                        </div>

                            Believe it or not, GURPS magic has a very magical feel to me. You need to base your advanced knowledge of (say) fire magic on lesser magics, you get tired as you cast (unless you're very good at it), and you have the chance to screw up big-time. Very much like many fantasy magics. Plus, mages can feel magic's presence, you can use magical knacks or improv magic instead, and magical staffs and gems are useful tools. Tribe 8's Synthesis system, and to some extent Mage and Ars Magica, have magical feels too, but GURPS still wins for "mystical magic" in my book.<br/>
<br/>
I tried for a mystical feel in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.valentgames.com/mini4.shtml" rel="nofollow">The Undying Lands</a>, and I think I sort of acheived it, balancing horrible backlashes and prices against strongly-flavored benefits.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, as D&amp;D adds more ridiculous and arbitrary guidelines for spells, it starts feeling <i>more</i> magical - it's something you can't understand from a scientific basis unless you're <b>outside the game</b> and can read HP values - but it's still shined-up science to me. This is also true for any game in which magic is based on a buy-spells-using-points system, such as Hero.<br/>
<br/>
Magic <b>can not be analyzed scientifically</b>, or we would call it "science," or "technology." Magic is incomprehensible, involving unrepeatable events. In my opinion, It should have a uniting "flavor" to it, or at least to various branches of it. It should still take some amount of power to use, and certain effects should be easier than others in a common-sense way, but there should be things that break those rules like the twigs they are.<br/>
<br/>
I won't say that "scientific magic" hinders my enjoyment of a game. There are certainly plenty of fun things you can do with it (at least until the next edition comes out and they "nerf" a spell to prevent what used to be a common, overpowered use of it). However, I tend to enjoy mystical magic a bit more.                        </div>

<p>We had a homebrew where characters would literally tape tarot cards to objects to enchant them, or throw them as projectiles, or eat them. It's the only time I've ever experienced a  magic system in a game where the intent was to actually do magical things, rather than replicate known technologies.</p>

<p><strong>1. What games have magic mechanics that feel 'magical' to you? Why?</strong><br>
<em>Land of 8 Million Dreams.</em> I think the handling of hsien magic in this game was really cool and sharp; you have a set of tools and strategies that are all full of interesting color. They define the alien internal logic of that magic interestingly. (For instance, if you're trying to stoke your Fire Chi to become swift and alert, you should wear red robes, eat spicy foods, and burn paper talismans.)</br></p>
<p><strong>2. What games have magic mechanics that don't feel 'magical' to you? Why?</strong><br>
D&amp;D. Mage: the Ascension. These always felt like fixtures for the tactical game to me.</br></p>
<p><strong>3. What do those answers that tell us about what you think of as magical?</strong><br>
Internal, alien logic!</br></p>
<p><strong>4. Does presence or absence of that 'magical-ness' hamper you enjoyment of the game?</strong> <br>
Not really, provided that that isn't the focus. Mage never worked for me because I couldn't really accept that such a boring system was the central focus of these characters' lives. D&amp;D works fine because, well, it's a fighty game. I'm there for the fight.</br></p>

                            1. What games have magic mechanics that feel 'magical' to you? Why?<br>
<br>
Ars Magica.  I like my magic to have rigid systems that don't make sense to the modern mind.  That may be why I've never got into Mage.<br>
<br>
Nobilis does magic really well to, but on a completely different scale.  Really the two are very related, noun + verb.<br/>
<br/>
2. What games have magic mechanics that don't feel 'magical' to you? Why?<br/>
<br/>
D&amp;D seems like a popular answer, which I will go with.  For me its not the limited selection of spells with little creativity, as I thought Shadowrun magic was entertaining (if not amazing).  I think what gets me about D&amp;D is the completely lack of any sane organizational principle.  And the 800 pages of spells.<br/>
<br/>
3. What do those answers that tell us about what you think of as magical?<br/>
<br/>
Internal, alien logic.  Ya, what they said.<br/>
<br/>
4. Does presence or absence of that 'magical-ness' hamper you enjoyment of the game?<br/>
<br/>
Only if the game is about magic.  If the game ain't, then I don't miss it.  This includes games like D&amp;D and Shadowrun, where the point of the game isn't the magic, its the conspiricy, the tactics, the whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
Final note: Polaris and Dogs (two games on my brain right now) also do magic very well, but they do it by not defining any system at all.  If you are going to do mysterious magic rather than internally consistant but weird magic this is the way to do it.<br/>

<em>Joshua and Joshua, how much does a game with a magical feel depend on GM fiat?</em><br/><br/>In my experience, Vax, none at all.  Synthesis almost runs itself; the difficulty levels are pretty clear-cut, and the backfire rules (you get lost in Dreams) have some interpretation involved, but it's mostly on the part of the player in question.  Mage is again less so -- the GM has to think up appropriate Paradox Spirits, Flaws, and Realms, which aren't flagged well if at all.  But then I played most of my Mage online where I was doing my own Paradox, anyway.                        </div>

<p>You know, I've never found a game that feels really magical to me. I've also never found a game with magic that jumps out at me as being saliently UNmagical. Admittedly, the vast majority of my experience with non-homebrew fantasy games has been D&amp;D of one variety or another, but the spell lists never jumped out of the page and slapped me in the face with the "NOT MAGICAL" glove, as they seem to have done to so many of ya'll.</p>
<p>I quite like spell lists actually. But that's because I love the tactical element inherent in them -- my Fireball dissipates on your Energy Resistance: Fire but how do you like a Rainbow Blast you smarmy bastard, hey? -- and not by any stretch because of their vibrant <em>magical</em> color.</p>
<p>I'd really like magical magic. I think it'd be way cool. Thinking about all the media I've ever read, heard, seen, and otherwise experienced, I think the most viscerally magical of them all have been Vance's original Dying Earth short stories, <em>Wicked</em> (a musical based on a book based on The Wizard of Oz), and <em>Howl's Moving Castle</em> (a Miyazaki flick). In <em>Wicked</em>, it was all about the technical theater aspects of the show that made it sow great -- they did this thing with a fog machine and rainbow colored light during Defying Gravity that I totally fell in love with. In Dying Earth and Howl, it was all about the incredibly cool wizard characters and the diverse and fantastic resources at their disposal.</p>
<p>So, for me, I think magical magic would need to provide</p>
<ul>
<li>Intense color</li>
<li>Wizards that are intensely wizardly</li>
<li>Lots of cool magic in lots of different forms</li>
</ul>
<p>Not exactly sure how all of that would be accomplished.</p>

<p>Honestly, I haven't played a game with GM fiat as a feature for years. It's a horrible conflict of interest that burns out GMs and fosters resentment between players.</p>
<p>I haven't used a lot of magical fun in Dogs in the Vineyard, but it totally, 100% doesn't rely on GM fiat for big magical stuff to happen. It relies on the Social Contract allowing for it, but that's the same as deciding to play a game for its magical content or not.</p>
<p>Make it a regular part of conflict resolution. Give lots of color stuff if you want Ã¢â‚¬â€ explain the rules of the four Elements, the three Principles, whatever, and that's how it works. Or give no color at all, and leave it to the players. But mechanically, it's the same as other elements of CR: the rules determine who has narrative rights.</p>

                            Thanks to those who have responded--it points me at a few games that I would like to take a look at.<br/>
<br/>
To answer some of my own questions:<br/>
<br/>
I actually have the same answer for both 1 and 2--namely, Mage 1st edition.  The premise of the system really excited me (the idea that you could define magic as the intersection of will and paradigm) but the mechanical follow-up was a let-down.  The focus on a magic break down based on vague classifications (entropy, mind) meant that the paradigms (sons of ether, cult of ecstasy) didn't really enter into the play except as a dash of color.<br/>
<br/>
Magic may be 'most magical' to me when it is:<br/>
1. reflective of an alien set of categories (joining the crowd on this one) <br/>
2. that its 'alien-ness' doesn't seem dependent on a 'higher order' version of scientific categories (i.e. can't be explained by appealing to subtleties of my 'common' sense)<br/>
<br/>
Frequently, I smuggle in a tacit third idea:<br/>
<br/>
3. aimed at exerting some causal force in the world<br/>
<br/>
but I'm not sure if that is required for magic proper (I'm trying to think about magical realism, where magic isn't a tool for agency but a backdrop through which agents move--i.e. 'dreamy' setting can be magical even if players aren't 'using' magic).<br/>
<br/>
It explains why D&amp;D works for me as magic, even if it isn't the most exciting expression of it (it does cater to my 3 bias leanings, too).                        </div>

Magic is often a tacked-on system; in my experience the most magical games have been those that everybody has access to magic, not just a portion of the characters.  So in Tribe 8 (no link for Synthesis, Vax, sorry), everybody as members of the Eighth Tribe has Eminences and most have powers beyond that.  In Mage 90% of the people you deal with are also mages.  Things break down where I'm the magicless fighter and you're the mage, and we both have different resolution systems to affect the fiction.                        </div>

                            Okay, I think I am beginning to understand where you're coming from, JBR.<br/>
<br/>
Have you played Heroquest?  I play in Mike's thursday night IRC game and I think, based on what you say, that it has the kind of magic system that feels magical to you.<br/>
<br/>
1&gt; Magical traits are handled, mechanically, 99% identically to mundane ones.<br/>
2&gt; Everyone (that matters) can put magical traits on their character sheets.<br/>
3&gt; Magical traits can be brought into conflicts by whatever means is good for the players<br/>
<br/>
Have you played HQ?  Am I on the money?<br/>
<br/>
I mention it because the magic in HQ doesn't feel particularly magical to me, for the very same reasons.  It's just another kind of trait.  There's a cause-and-effect chain for any magical effect.  Magic is commonplace, understandable, and in the end, is just another technique for getting things done.                        </div>

                            Magic in Heroquest can feel magical, it's really up to the group in question. Once you get into big HeroQuesting, mythic resonance, and cultural rooting it gets pretty magical IMNHO. But at start up, when you just have a grab-bag of "magical feats" that are the same as your skills, it can feel pretty flat.                        </div>

                            I guess I'm still not understanding how that differentiation works.<br/>
<br/>
You have a stick in your hand.  I have a quarterstaff.<br/>
You break the stick.<br/>
My quarterstaff breaks.<br/>
<br/>
That's magic, right?<br/>
<br/>
Now consider the following:<br/>
<br/>
You have a stick in your hand.  I have a quarterstaff.<br/>
<i>You create a magical connection between your stick and my staff.</i><br/>
You break the stick.<br/>
<i>The magic travels from your stick to my staff.</i><br/>
My quarterstaff breaks.<br/>
<br/>
Now it becomes a causal technique rather than magic?<br/>
<br/>
Is the fact that the italicized lines are invisible, that makes it magical?  Because to the practitioner, they're not.                        </div>

                            Generally you'd do "Far Sight" and "Curse with Stomach Pains" -- though those are only at the most specific level of skill. You could also have Grimiores or Spirits or Domains that were things like "Contagion" in which there were would be a list of spells/group of abilities/clump of feats that may have specific names like "curse with stomach pains" or "Doom of Izanore."                        </div>

Vax -- sort of?  It's actually more of a matter of transmission of causality -- science requires physical contact or intermediaries (gravitons, electrical fields); magic in this case doesn't.                        </br></br></div>

                            Sort of on this tack, I'd love to see a game that had associative-style magic with a religious basis and didn't have that purely personal tactics basis.

                            Josh, <br><br>I'd actually say it is less a matter of causality, and more an issue of what type of philisophical causality you're talking about. Most folks, for example, would not find reverse causality to be scientific causality -- despite the fact that both are "causal." <br><br>That is to say, both the Bhagavad Gita and Newtonian Mechanics have things to say about causality, but the things they say are very different because they rest on different philisophical positions and ideas about how the universe works.

                            JBR: Science doesn't require it; physics does.  There's an important distinction.<br>
<br>
Science is merely a method of investigating the universe.  It doesn't matter HOW one thing causes another, if there is causation, then science can investigate the nature of that causation.<br/>
<br/>
Physics is a set of natural laws that we humans have codified to describe the workings of the universe.  We came to understand those laws using science.<br/>
<br/>
Many magical constructs have a "Law of Contagion" ... the word "law" here is important.  It's talking about a law of nature, if you think about it.  To someone who understands this law, the stick/staff breaking thing is an application of a known principle.<br/>
<br/>
At least, that's the way I look at it.                        </br></br></div>

                            Fred, <br/><br/>Are you talking about the science that can investigate anything that causes another thing, so long as those things can be investigated in ways based upon empiricism, experimentation, and methodological naturalism in repeatable patterns, usually based upon methodological materialism? <br/><br/>Or are you talking about the science that is any systematic field of study or the knowledge gained from it?<br/><br/>Because those are two different sciences, and like the many different magics being discussed in this thread, the casual use of terms leads to confusion between those using different definitions.<br/><br/>P.S.

Well, you can actually do that in HeroQuest as well -- it's just that because its in there with the other stuff it becomes less important. <br/><br/>Still, it probably wouldn't be all that hard to do, stip out the current magic system, and use the community support rules along with the spirit binding rules to make the "magical relationships" go, and it'd be pretty quick that you'd have "what you bind on earth is bound in heaven" level social and interpersonal power going on.<br/><br/>You could also do something like that with Dogs, I'm thinkin. <br/><br/>But a whole system built around that being the point?

<p>What Fred's saying isn't contrary to my original meaning: of course you're still <em>causing</em> something to happen.  The point is that a) any Naturalistic explanation is irrelevant and b) it's not scientifically reproduceable. Hermetic magic aside, it's the meaning of the situation that makes stuff happen, not the actions themselves. Reciting a poem about breaking sticks should be identical, mechanically speaking (and even cosmologically speaking within the fiction), given that they mean the same thing.</p>

                            And the logic Josh likes are things based on correspondence and contagion. Probably because his favorite types of magic work off of those things. <br/><br/>Another example would be priesthood magics -- things like healing by the laying on of hands. Imagine for a moment a world in which such things exist (he says with a straight face), but in which they only worked when 1) the priesthood authority was personally in a state of purity and 2) only when God wanted it to. <br/><br/>So you can pray and bless someone, and there is a logical process by which they will or will not be healed. If you are pure, and God thinks it is good for them to be healed, they will be healed. If you are not pure, they will not be healed. If you are pure but God does not think it is time for them to be healed, they will not be healed. (God may think that for all kinds of reasons.) <br/><br/>Now, given a world in which the mind of God is not knowable, and the state of someone's ritual purity is always open to question, you're going to have a fuck of a time proving or disproving that blessings work scientifically. They are repeatable, but never independently repeatable. Because the background process is not a mechanistic or naturalistic process, but depends on intangible and untestable variables, it isn't going to meet that whole "scientific empiricism" thing. It works on a different set of principles than those that say that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (assuming the correct amount of purity and no movement in the water). You can't know ahead of time how it is going to work, or test for why it failed (or possibly even test for why it worked). <br/><br/>Thus: magic.<br/><br/>Though, notably, those who are parts of many religions that would see such things as possible would not call them "magic" Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as "magic" in that case implies something outside the bounds of their religion. Thus magic often becomes the eternal "other" Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whatever your paradigm it is the thing that doesn't fit with "normality."                        </div>

                            Brand, your last point is kind of what I'm working towards...<br/>
<br/>
We see the kind of magic that you're talking about as mysterious and cool because it's alien.<br/>
<br/>
To the people who do it, it's not alien, and therefore any mystery and any coolness comes from some other property than alienness.<br/>
<br/>
Now in the context of a game, how do you model the will of god, or ritual purity, or whatever causes things not to work as expected?<br/>
<br/>
As I see it,  there are at least three options:<br/>
<br/>
1&gt; Chance<br/>
2&gt; Fiat (either on the GM's part, or the player's part)<br/>
3&gt; Combination of the two<br/>
<br/>
Do you see what I was talking about, about cool magic systems involving GM fiat?  I was wrong when I said GM fiat, I should have just said fiat.                        </div>

What's the difference between "I fast for ten days and bathe myself every three hours so I'm pure" and "I work out morning and night and spar with the boys every chance I get so I'm strong"?                        </div>

                            Fred, <br><br>Well in the above system it would be pretty simple to do it if you used something like Trollbabe. If you hit the first time, God smiles and delivers you. If you fail the first time and hit the second, God lets you go deeper into trouble before delivering you. If you fail the first and second time and hit the third, God does not favor you but you get to say why. ("So that the wicked can grow more ripe before they are destroyed!") If you fail all three times, God does not favor you and the GM gets to say why. ("Because you have angered him by invoking his name in vain!") <br/><br/>All that you have to do is have a system that allows for multiple layers of input and output, and doing things that are mysterious without fiat isn't impossible. HeroQuest works pretty well for this reason too -- when you use your "DEATH BLADE OF DOOM" and you get only a minor success and the enemy doesn't die you gotta have a reason why....                        </br></br></div>

<p>Hmm, I think Fred is on to something there. Why <em>are</em> we assuming there must be mechanical validation that the magic is real?</p>
<p>I think the most realistic magic is ambiguous. Well, he might have just fell down and hit his head on a rock... but we all know it's because the shaman put a curse on him. So perhaps magic could just be the social ability to convince others that innocuous events are, in fact, your doing. Because hey, who's to say that they're not?</p>

                            Larry, Vax... that's how all roleplaying works.  You roll dice and check stats to be able to add something to the fiction.  The stuff on your sheet merely encodes your rights to narration.  Framing those rights in terms of the character and the character's circumstances is what makes it roleplaying.                        </div>

<p>Fred, come on, man. I already said that: color it however you want. The point is that <em>significance</em> has no bearing on <em>causality</em> in a Naturalistic world. The Universe is non-sentient and things happen because other things made them happen, like billiard balls bouncing around a table. As soon as things are subject to symbology, (and laying on hands is a symbol) it's magic.</p>
<p>It can be any system where intention and communication are the modes of operation. This can be mechanically supported by requiring the use of symbols in some way, or it can be a matter of color. Whatever. To make it retain its mystical nature, make it as capricious as humans are when they communicate with motives.</p>

                            Larry, <br/><br/>You know that when you roll that something happens. If it was magic or not is up to what you're doing with the roll. <br/><br/>For example, in Dogs I usually play with the supernatural dial set to what I call "plausible deniability." That is, you set your raises to things that could be explained away with science (even if only with difficulty) but can equally be seen as faith magic. A great example from one of my online games was when the Dogs found a girl hung in the middle of town square, and cut her down. She's blue and not breathing and dying and so they decide to heal her. The way they posed it was putting her on her back, tilting her head back and putting it on a Book of Life, and opening her mouth to put some sacred earth on her tongue, then praying. They rolled, she lived. Did she live because of their prayers? Or because they effectivly cleared her airway as part of their ritual preperations? Who knows. All we know is that because their dice worked, they saved her. Could be magic, could be something any paramedic could do.<br/><br/>Same deal with the "Trollbabe as clerical magic" thing I was talking about. If you're making poses like "I call for the angels to come with flaming swords and burn the whole city to the ground" then you're not going to be mysterious magic. If, otoh, you are making poses like "I pray that God delivers me from the hands of the enemies. After I pray I stay in jail for two more days then the judge sets me free" then you are. <br/><br/>Its one of the many, many things that I love about systems that give you the effects of what you do without giving you the explicit results of what you do.                        </div>

If you posit that significance DOES have a bearing on causality in your world, then in that world, it is natural for significance to have a bearing on causality, and thus it is part of the natural world.<br/>
<br/>
It's even investigable scientifically.<br/>
<br/>
Posit any world where magic ACTUALLY works (rather than one of Brand's "plausible deniability" worlds, where it's merely a lens on one's perceptions) and I'll formulate a scientific investigation that can measure it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, humans are capricious... but their reactions can be scientifically analyzed in the aggregate.  That's how they do those prayer-healing correlation studies.  They take a random bunch of sick people, and divide them into four groups.  Half, they get a group of monks to pray for every day.  Another half (not correlated with the first selection) they _tell_ that they're being prayed for.<br/>
<br/>
(As an aside, in the real world, this question is still open; definitive proof hasn't been found in either direction.  That being said, it CAN be measured.  We just haven't measured it ENOUGH to make conclusions yet.)                        </div>

I noticed you never answered the original questions. Maybe you should do that before this thread just sprirals into an unfocused "What is magic?" debate.                        </div>

                            1. What games have magic mechanics that feel 'magical' to you? Why?<br/><br/>None.  I've never played a game where magic <i>mechanics</i> felt magical.

Why?<br/><br/>See <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  I've never found one.<br/><br/>3. What do those answers that tell us about what you think of as magical?<br/><br/>If you apply mechanics to it, you take the mystery out of it.<br/><br/>4. Does presence or absence of that 'magical-ness' hamper you enjoyment of the game?<br/><br/>Yes.

<p>Fred, you're positing that the psychology of natural phenomena is more of a hard, objective science than the psychology of people.</p>
<p>This is a paradigm issue. I'm saying "In a world where things act like people, you can negotiate with them, but <em>at best</em> they are only aware of their motives, and only as willing to tell you them, as people are ."</p>
<p>And you're saying "People can be scientifically understood in a causal fashion."</p>
<p>I don't buy it. You know, sensitivity to initial conditions and all. But it doesn't matter! We're just gonna like different games about magic.</p>
<p>.... Hm. I had a moment to think while I cleaned my screen (I couldn't see what I was typing through the caramel). Would it work for you if your opposition player (GM or whatever) make some secret rolls for the personality and motivation of the object you're trying to converse with? That way, you don't know the precise nature of the challenge and will have to come up with a new process each time. I'm thinking you know a certain amount about something: what the proportions of the Elements are in it, for instance, but that gives the GM a certain number of dice for each of those elements: Fire 0, Water 3, Earth 3, Air 2 for a quarterstaff, for instance (off the top of my head). But you don't know what the results of the rolls are until they're made. That way, there's individualism for this particular stick, but it still follows Magical principles.</p>

I'm not sure exactly who said it, but i recall hearing a quote that goes something like this.  It was from Viet Nam.<br/>

"Take your average rookie soldier out on patrol.  First time we get shot at, ninety percent of them are going to freeze, take a bullet, and that's it.  Those are worthless.  Nine percent are going to dive for cover and wait for orders.  Those are soldiers.  One percent are going to fight back."                        </div>

<p>Well, that's interesting. What if that was true for objects, as well? 90% would act as you wanted them to act (they're not <em>human</em>, so they bow to human will), 9% will protect themselves from manipulation, and 1% will fight you.</p>
<p>That sounds pretty neat. I think the numbers kinda suck, but that's what playtest is for.</p>

My point is, that while you may not be able to predict how an individual person will react in a particular situation, you can predict how MOST people will react in a particular situation, if you've done your research.  People are complex, yes, but they're not complete mysteries.                        </div>

<p>Sure, but there's a profound difference between a statistician and a psychologist. A statistician gets to know people. A psychologist gets to know a person.</p>
<p>Of course, the psychologist is armed with statistical <em>data</em>, but it's only a guide to learning the specifics of the person.</p>

                            JACN: Of course... but what information does the psychiatrist arm himself with when he's treating a patient?  Statistics.  <br/><br/>For symptoms A and B and C, and test results D and E, and situation F, treatment regime J2 has worked best, possibly augmented by drug Y and exercise Z; if those don't work, try regime J5 and J6, and replace drug Y with drugs W2, W3, or W4.  <br/><br/>Progress is based on a fairly simple idea: What has worked in the past can be expected to work in the future.<br/><br/>WHOO...  inspiration.<br/><br/>What if that were not true for magic?  What if it was impossible to become a BETTER wizard by studying and practicing?<br/><br/>Imagine a world where there were some fundamental laws of magic (similarity, contagion, etc) but these had come about through some kind of divine agency rather than trial and error or scientific inquiry... because <i>any given ritual only works once.</i><br/><br/>Think about it.  You want to break down a door.  So using the principles you know, you take a slab of wood, touch it to the door, and then snap it in half with your hands, and voila!  The door shatters.<br/><br/>Next time you try it, though, it doesn't work.  Same for anyone who saw it happen, same for anyone you tell about it, same for anyone who reads your description of the event.  As soon as you know it CAN be done... it can't.<br/><br/><b>Magic Requires Mystery.</b>  The more you know about it, the less effective you are.

                            The Practice Effect was different.<br/>
<br/>
In that world, objects became better at whatever they were used for, simply by being used.  The way to make a sword, for example, was to take a lump of rock, shape it vaguely like a sword, and then start cleaving and thrusting with it, over and over.  The more you used it, the better the edge, balance, etc. would get, until you had a crystalline blade of incredible utility.<br/>
<br/>
Not really the same.<br/>

I never played Changeling, but the idea sounds like it would fit in well with a fae setting.                        </div>

If it finally is explained (always, under these circumstances, these gestures, result in), then, yeah, the magic has basically been reduced to color (which does happen in D&amp;D).  But if, with each new reason, a new mystery presents itself, new complication that must be 'diagnosed,' then we start getting further into magic.<br/><br/>I liked Changeling's effort to push magic further, outside the cookbook, but the fact that it had to be different every time just seemed like dogmatism of a different sort.  <br/><br/>Magic = (color) + (reasons) + (unknown features that skew manipulation--but qua unknown, not qua random)                        </div>

<p>Sure it does.</p>
<p>I'm in the habit of opening doors, okay.</p>
<p>So, since I know the nonrepetition principle, I make a plan: I get many many different breakable objects (sticks, index cards, playing cards, bits of wood and bark and glass and sugar candy) and I touch them to the door and break them. Then when I run out, I stop touching them to the door, I just break them nearby.</p>
<p>Then I get some style and start destroying them in more dramatic ways.</p>
<p>Then I get bored and develop an unlocking technique - I tie a knot in something, and touch it to the door and untie it. Repeat process above.</p>

<br/>
Hm.  I haven't really been thinking in those terms, but I can see that it is a meaningful question.<br/>
<br/>
Let me start with a few that have "mundane" magic, in my opinion.  This is not to say that the books are bad or good, just that the magic in them doesn't feel magical to me.<br/>
<br/>
Xanth<br/>
Master of the Five Magics<br/>
Harry Potter<br/>
Zelazny's Amber series<br/>
<br/>
There.  Making that little list has kind of brought things into sharper relief, as to what actually feel's Magical.  Again, I'm not commenting on relative quality, just on how the magic works.  Here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Vance's Dying Earth<br/>
Zelazny's Jack of Shadows<br/>
Piers Anthony's Proton/Phase books<br/>
<br/>
What these two works have in common, is that every magical practitioner is different, has a different way of going about it, can do different things.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure that's translatable into a roleplaying game.                        </div>

                            Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Fred, of course, that HQ magic is magical feeling. In fact, I'd say that this is the biggest reason I play HQ. <br/>
<br/>
But Fred is wrong about Clarke's Law, and in his error we find the key to magic. The person doing magic doesn't see it at all like it's technology. To the person doing magic, he feels that it's supernatural. That it breaks the rules of the physical universe. Because it comes from beyond. <br/>
<br/>
And that's it, gents. To make magic feel magical, you have to feel it's source every time you use it - or, rather, the character's belief in it's source. So, the earlier comment that somebody made about HQ magic not feeling magical at first can sorta be true. Rather, for things like "common magic" this is actually appropriate. Because this magic is so, well, common, that the characters who use it probably don't think much about the source. Any more than the average person does when they cast the little spell to cast out cold demons when they say, "God Bless You" when you sneeze. <br/>
<br/>
But if you take a second to think of where that blessing comes from in the Christian religion, from Christ telling us how to cast out demons, you can see the source of the magic. God, in this case. Some little saint's Outsmart Pig Spell might fall into this category in Glorantha. <br/>
<br/>
For specialized magic, you have a "Worship X" sort of ability rating, and a "Know Myths of X" ability rating. These determine your character's connection to that otherworldly entity that's delivering you the magic. One doesn't "do" magic in most cases, really, one opens up a conduit to the source of the magic, and it happens. If one is doing magic, then one is magical oneself, and that's special too (called Natural Magic in HQ). <br/>
<br/>
I just wrote about this in the FATE forum. Making something magical is not about making it mysterious in it's functioning. It's about making it mysterious in terms of knowing that it comes from some otherworld, and knowing how "impossible" that is. How does some diety allow you to channel some feat replicating some act they performed in myth? Nobody knows how it works, that's the mystery. But it does, and that's the cool part. <br/>
<br/>
That's what D&amp;D lacks - the coolest spells in D&amp;D are those with the names Bigby, Mordenkainen, or Tensor in them. Because you get at least a taste of where they came from. GURPS pre-requisites give a feeling that there's some background process that one is learning, so that's it's one advantage, though otherwise its pretty dry. <br/>
<br/>
Actually I think that mages in GURPS are required to have relevant knowledge skills. Same in Hero System, actually. Why don't these work like in HQ? Because in HQ you can figure out a contest about losing faith, or about magical backlash, or about other things that result from the context of using or abusing the magic in HQ (no rules for that in GURPS - though I've seen some offered). Defy your god and use a feat to do something that he does not like? Oh, big time contest to see if he decides to strip the character's abilities for a while to teach him a lesson. <br/>
<br/>
With Animism in HQ, this is all painfully up front. You don't "do" magic at all. Spirits do magic. Practitioners of animist traditions just know one thing: how to ask the spirits to come along for the ride and help out. Each spirit is it's own little relationship that you have to work out. <br/>
<br/>
Wizardry is, perhaps, the most fascinating. At first I thought that it was somewhat like the others, but it has a subtle difference. The monotheistic god leaves us on our own to decide how to use the magic of the essence of the world. Yeah, that means you can use it for evil deeds if you want - this is referred to as sorcery. When you die, he'll look at your magic use, and sort you to solace or hell at that point. But life is, in fact, a test to see how people will use things like the magic he's made available to them. <br/>
<br/>
I have a character who is a vizier sort who just found three books of sorcery (and two about demonology) in a HQ game I'm playing. Oh...my...lord am I psyched about the question of what comes next. I've already decided that he's going to read them, "Because it's important to know what the enemy is capable of." Can you sense the massive bangs I'm creating for my character? I intentionally created him nearly devoid of useful magic...he's going to be tempted, tempted, tempted. Hmmm, maybe if I use these spells with good intent, then they're not sorcery, right? <br/>
<br/>
See the deceptive road to the dark side, rising ahead of him?<br/>
<br/>
HQ also makes magic feel magical, because the political conflicts are really all about belief systems. So each use of magic becomes almost a political statement, a religio-political statement. That provides massive context to the magic, making one reflect on the otherworldly sources that the character believes in, and the mysteries that he has to deal with when using magic. That is, the conflicts of the mundane world are really all about what magic is "right" and such, and who's beliefs are right. Magical practitioners even train themselves to see the sort of magic that they believe in, blinding themselves to that of others. <br/>
<br/>
From another perspective, perhaps the other forms of magic are bogus. Who's to say what's real and what's magical chicanery? The fact that in HQ, that the characters do not have 100% faith makes them seem like us in our quests to find magic in the real world. Be that modern day communion, or the ancient rituals of fire performed on the slopes of Vesuvius. That's the real mystery, what's the truth? Magic isn't an answer, it's people trying to prove the supernatural nature of the universe. <br/>
<br/>
Another part of the context is that the magic ability must make sense to the source of the magic. Soooo many RPGs get this wrong, with priests all selecting spells from the same list, for example, to say nothing of magic schools all having the same spells, etc. In HQ, all of the feats of a diety are specific to myths of the diety (even if they're not all spelled out, looking at them you can almost imagine what the myths are from the names of the feats). <br/>
<br/>
This means that there is a bewildering variety of magic in this model. Nothing breaks down the magical feel more than realizing that a particular spell exists because it's useful for adventurers traversing a dungeon. Fireball isn't actually a bad ability this way, if it's obtained as a feat from a fire diety, or from a school of fire magic. And this is why Outsmart Pig Charms and such exist. "Real" magic doesn't exist just to help adventurers, it exists based on it's sources. So "homey" magic like a charm that helps farmers wrangle their pigs feels very real. It makes the source apparent in it's use, and that, again, is the context that makes it feel magical. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And this is all before doing rituals or going on heroquests to the otherworlds themselves, which, as pointed out, is just more magical feeling than anything else I've ever played. <br/>
<br/>
So it's magical context with regard to character belief. You have to feel your character's belief in his magic for the magic to feel magical. Note that there were a group of people in Glorantha that did, at one point, try to prove that there were no gods, and that magic was just a force of the natural world like any other to be manipulated - the godlearners. These arrogant men stopped the sun in the sky, rearranged the reality of the gods, and did other amazing things. But then the gods made a comback and kicked their asses. <br/>
<br/>
Or did they? Only by playing can you find out. Mystery, mystery, mystery surrounding beliefs in things supernatural. Magical. <br/>

                            Mike, <br/><br/>That's pretty much what I was talking about in terms of different paradigms of magic. HQ is awesome in that it (and Pendragon, funny how Greg was in both games) succesfully fuses magic and religion to get a feeling of mystery and otherness. <br/><br/>This, however, is a different interpretation of magic than the hermetic, the chaotic, or the simply inexplicable that others focus on when they say magic. For some religion is magic, for others religion is the most unmagical thing there is. <br/><br/>Thus the problems of defining the word. <br/><br/>(P.S. Mike, do you know where the bit about Sunset Leap that Greg did went to? I can't find it on the HQ page right now, and it makes an awesome example about the "living myth and mystery religion" aspect of HQ magic.)<br/><br/>Fred, <br/><br/>I think you could do Jack of Shadows or similar works in several RPGs -- you'd just have to use one of those systems in which the mechanics tell you what happens without telling you (at least fully) how it happens. That way Jack can have his key and the Duke can have his dream, but you can still use the system because it doesn't tell you how Jack uses the key to win -- just that he does. <br/><br/>Heroquest, btw, also does that. <br/><br/>I mean, you've played HQ I know -- could you see doing Jack of Shadows with it?<br/><br/>Joshua RamaGupta, <br/><br/>It also occurs to me that your La Ludo Lernanta Lingvo game could be a nifty bit for magical practice of a specific type: the Earthsea/Hermeticesque "power of the name" type magic. In the game you could specify a language to be your "magic language" (I'd use Sanskrit, because... well... I would) and then make your rules from that game the needed part to do magic. Power of the name and the word, and your mastery of the secret language is what gives you your power.                        </div>

                            Fred, <br/><br/>Yep. HQ would just allow you to have the room to do it. That's what I was saying about the open interpretations systems earlier. <br/><br/>If you want a closed system that tells you exactly what happens and yet makes it feel that type of magical, it's gonna be much harder.                        </div>

<br/>
The idea of some "other" hermetic magic that has no context is a product of D&amp;D. Rather, that's what I was trying to say about Sorcery, and God Learners. That is, it's also kosher to be "atheist" about magic using HQ. But if so, then *that* becomes your character's belief system about magic. And that gives it the same sort of context. Sorcerer's either don't believe in god, or act in defiance of god. God Learners try to co-opt the gods. But either way, this says something about their beliefs. <br/>

                            Mike, <br/><br/>I've read lots of stuffs. Including the Corpus Hermeticum (more or less), so I know what you're saying. <br/><br/>My point, however, is that the idea of religion and otherness and magic all being tied together isn't a universal one -- even if it is one that you and I share.  And that isn't just because of D&amp;D, or RPGs, or modern fiction at all. <br/><br/>So while you and I will find HQ magic very magical, because it fits our ideas about what magic should feel like, I don't think we can be surprised when people who would rather have, say,  The Principia Discordia or some kind of non-rationalist phenomenalism as their idea of magic don't find what they're looking for in HQ. <br/><br/>Clearer?<br/><br/>P.S. Da Vinci code, gag.  I recently wrote on my livejournal the following review of said book: It occurs to me that Focault's Pendulum and Holy Blood Holy Grail are first cousins. In order to make their geek fringe cred into something that people who like John Grisham will read, the publishing houses decided to go against the laws of God and Nature and breed these books along with genetic contributions from Language of the Goddess.<br/><br/>The result is a deformed child, twisted into a distorted caraciture of its noble ancestors. It limps along on club feet of poor pacing, rasping its sad and mumbling breaths through the hair lip of broken prose. Blearily blink its watery eyes, staring out into a world that it barely comprehends, making monstrous the common issues of mankind with its degenerate imagination.                        </div>

                            Brand, nobody who plays Hero Quest is going to personally agree with all of the sorts of explanations for magic that it presents. In fact, since they are all fictional representations of Glorantha, nobody should probably agree overall with the cosmology at all in terms of  "how magic works." What HQ does is to present magic in a way that allows any theoretical context to work. You could easily put in Discordian magic if you wanted to do so. I apply the HQ rules to a world that is not Glorantha, and it works just fine. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps unsurprisingly people focus on the three major forms of magic presented in HQ because they are laid out in as much detail as they are. And, actually, I think that these do cover, for most people, most of the sorts of magical traditions that one might like to portray in a fantasy setting, so it's even less surprsing. But HQ does not assume that these are the only three magical traditions available. There is also Common Magic (including forms of concentration on it like Self-Rock teaching), Natural Magic, the very mixed up Teshnan magic, Lunar Magic, Mysticism, and more forms of magic that have been at the very least identified as existing in Glorantha as separate from the bigh three in how they function. The point being that the big three are simply examples. It's not difficult to portray other forms of magical belief, and HQ gives you an exeplary framework for doing any magical mode. <br/>
<br/>
I mean, are you arguing that Discordian magic should have been portrayed in Glorantha? HQ is written as a game for Glorantha, so all of the examples are, well, Gloranthan. If you're saying that the flaw is that Glorantha doesn't have the sort of magic in it that you're talking about...well, you'll have to talk to Greg about that, I guess. But that doesn't say anything about the HQ system that can handle this and any magical system you care to come up with. <br/>
<br/>
Because, in the end, using HQ, you can give any magical system the mechanical abilities that it should have in order to have the sort of context it needs to feel magical. A magic keyword comes down largely to having the following things:<br/>
<br/>
 - A relationship to the source of the Magic (Worship Orlanth, Know Discord)<br/>
 - An understanding of the Stories by which we understand the source (Orlanth Myths, Principia Discordia)<br/>
 - Relationships to the people and social structures that are involved in getting to know the magic (Know Priest, Member of Temple, alt.religion.eris)<br/>
 - The magic itself as it comes from the source, matching the source (Storm Affinity, Cause Chaos)<br/>
 - Virtues that are good to have to make the magic work (Bold for Orlanth, Freethinking for Discordianism). <br/>
<br/>
Note that I'm no expert in Discordianism, so the above examples for it are probably wildly off. But you get the idea, I'm sure, if you know it, you can portray it well using the HQ rules. <br/>
<br/>
I'd actually argue that, again, the rules for Sorcery that exist actually cover 95% of what you're describing - in fact I think that HQ Wizardry was written specifically to take into account this sort of western tradition. But it works in other worlds as well - in Shadow World, all "Essence Users" simply follow the rules for Adepts, without anyone thinking that there's a monotheistic god behind it. That's a detail that's specific to Glorantha, and even there I'll bet we'd find some culture somewhere that has essence users who don't exist in the shadow of the monotheistic church. <br/>
<br/>
But even for the other 5%, the same general requirements exist even if Wizardry doesn't cover them. What's important in terms of context for these magical traditions are the same general things above - what's the nature of where the magic comes from, how do we know about it (often for adepts, what books do we read), who do we have to go through to learn this stuff, what do they expect from us, and what sort of magic is provided as an end-result. <br/>
<br/>
As opposed to the typical RPG that at best provides scant lip service to everything except for the effects. Even in Ars Magica, where the orders are well described, what you lack is a mechanical reinforcement of these contextual details. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, Brand, Greg often laments that he has trouble teaching people how magic like this makes sense, because they approach it from a rational POV. That is, it's his point that all magic systems emerge from a "Pre-Rationalism" mindset. In fact, one could almost define rationalism as disbelief in explanations for phenomenon like magic. Interestingly, I think that you could apply the HQ model to a rational model for these sorts of abilities - like Psionics or something - and it would make them, if not magical, what they should feel like. But the argument that HQ mechanics don't support some sort of non-rational description of the universe is almost completely upside down. It goes way, way out of it's way to try to describe a non-rational universe. <br/>
<br/>
This is what I feel makes it feel magical. actually. That you can feel the mindset of the character experiencing it, feeling his connection to the otherworldly supernatural source of the magic. In any case, in the more general sense of this thread, whether or not HQ specifically supports X or Y sort of magical tradition, I stick by my overal observation. That magic sans context feels like a game resource or technology like it does in D&amp;D - what's the difference between a "Magic Missile" spell and a repeating crossbow other than the fact that you don't have to roll to hit? Other than the in-game description of what it looks like, nothing, really. To make magic missile feel magical, we'd have to understand what context the character is in to have this ability, and have the ability (even if left unused) to persue these contextual details mechanically. <br/>
<br/>
You could probably do better than HQ with this, but I think HQ does as well or better than any other system out there. <br/>

<code>I mean, are you arguing that Discordian magic should have been portrayed in Glorantha? </code><br/>No. I am arguing that when different people in our world say "magic" and "feels magical" they are talking about very different things. Not "differnt" in the sense of "has a different cosmological background in the game" but "different" as in "they think about the way the real world works differently, and so have radically seperate ideas as to what magic should be/is." <br/><br/>Which goes with what you say here: <code>Ironically, Brand, Greg often laments that he has trouble teaching people how magic like this makes sense, because they approach it from a rational POV. That is, it's his point that all magic systems emerge from a "Pre-Rationalism" mindset. In fact, one could almost define rationalism as disbelief in explanations for phenomenon like magic.</code><br/>Because, um, Greg has a different idea of what magic is than they do? Of how the world works, or could work, than they do? <br/><code>But the argument that HQ mechanics don't support some sort of non-rational description of the universe is almost completely upside down. It goes way, way out of it's way to try to describe a non-rational universe.</code><br/>Good thing I never made that argument*. (Though others may have.) <br/><br/>The argument I made, in short form, is thus: HeroQuest does a good job at making magic feel magical, once you get invested, by having magic tied to religion and beliefe in the game world and using a flexible open interpretation system to encode the effects of magic into the fiction. For me this works very well, as I like both things.**<br/><br/>It won't work for everyone, however, because for many people magic and religion are not tied. In fact, for any number of philosophers and theologians, religion and magic are exact opposites. Anselm the priest isn't going to have the same view of magic as Greg the shaman, and that is going to tell out in the way people react to a game feeling magical or not. <br/><br/>So, just to be clear, Mike -- I agree with you about HeroQuest. But I can see pretty clearly where others would not. <br/><br/>*Heroquest can do non-rationalism pretty well, especially in the deistic sense. It can even get to the point of reverse causality, which I like a lot. It's hold on phenomenalism is questionable, given its relation to the spirit worlds and different cosmologies -- which is why I specifically said someone with a non-rationalist phenomenalism ideation may have issues with it. Not because it "makes the world rational" but because it doesn't make the world "a mystical collection of sense data with no underlying substratum of existance." And sure, you can push it that way in game, but a lot of the background material doesn't support that reading. <br/><br/>**I think there is actually a double-whammy effect for most RPGers coming to HeroQuest and dealing with magic. The magic is non-rationalist (in the philisophical sense) and the system is open input and doesn't tell you what happens, only what the effect is. So you go from a rationalist magical system with a defined effect system to non-rational and open-input. And the result is the many brain explosions we've seen on the HQ lists and such.                        </div>

<p>Right.</p>
<p>It appears to work for Glorantha, because Glorantha is <em>obsessed</em> with religion. It doesn't work for me; I don't care about religion and that's an attitude that'll be reflected in characters I play; that makes me unable to play a magician in HQ because I can't evenhandedly portray what I see as a zealot.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can easily play a magician in Exalted, because there I am just taking note that there is a jail full of demons somewhere Out Of Space and learning gives me the keys.</p>

<i>Religion, as in, cosmology and its derivative (and often esoteric) systems, is inherent in magic.</i><br/><br/>Really?  Sure, in the strictest sense, I would agree with you that magic has its roots in an elaboration of a religious cosmology.  But that shared history doesn't lead to the two being inseparable in a practical (especially rpg) sense.  I think it's fair to say, for example, that D&amp;D's wizards don't have to be religious in any real sense of the term--sure, their magic is hardwired to the cosmology, but the existence of a cosmology is not innately religious.<br/><br/>Arguably, in fact, one of the key distinctions that I make between magic and religion has less to do with cosmology than with attitude.  Magic tends to be about manipulating the cosmological elements whereas religion tends to be about giving reverence to portions of that cosmology.  Sure, there is overlap (hence the 'tend' talk), but that only shows we are discussing terms that share some of the same turf.<br/><br/>Historically, we can play this out nicely--frequently we find religious figures concerned about the efforts on the part of laypeople to manipulate divine forces rather than properly respect them (Catholic saints anybody?).  <br/><br/>But that gets away from the matter--I see no reason to think that we couldn't have a game in which magic is not intimately tied to religion.                        </div>

                            Joshua AC, <br/><br/>Yea, sure, but cosmology and its attendent systems is also an inherent part of science and rationalism as well as non-rationalism. So, in that case, you could also say that science is inherent in magic is inherent in religion... which would be perfectly logical in some contexts (medieval Persian Islam, for example) and not at all in others (modern American Christian fundementalism). <br/><br/>And in any paradigm what is and is not magic will vary. To someone outside monotheism, for example, the practice of prayer can be considered a magical practice in fine, in full, and in specific. Few modern North American Christians, however, consider prayer to be a magical act or practice, or the priesthood to be a magical calling. That, of course, has to do with the cultural value of the worlds "magic" and "priesthood" and "spirituality" and all that jazz... but that's what I've been talking about the whole time.<br/><br/>And, since we've decided to be cute and get back to Latin and etymology as part of the argument, I return to the OED, in which we learn thusly about magic:<br/><br/><code>    1. a. The use of ritual activities or observances which are intended to influence the course of events or to manipulate the natural world, usually involving the use of an occult or secret body of knowledge; sorcery, witchcraft. Also: this practice as a subject of study.<br/>  The relationships between magic, religion, and science are central to the history of the term in English. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, magic, and esp. conjuration, are regarded as falling outside the province of religion proper. However, those areas of magic which stemmed from the Hermetic and Neoplatonic traditions were widely regarded in the medieval and early modern periods as legitimate and necessary fields of enquiry, as was much of the field of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœnatural magicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (see sense 1b). Subsequently, with the spread of rationalistic and scientific explanations of the natural world in the West, the status of magic has declined.<br/><br/>    b. With defining adjective. natural magic hist. (also {dag}magic natural), magic involving the manipulation of supposed occult properties of the natural world (usually excluding the conjuration of personal spirits); this skill as a subject of study.<br/><br/>    c. An instance of magic; a magical procedure or rite. Also concr.: a magical object, a charm or fetish.<br/><br/>    d. as if by magic: as though accomplished by supernatural means or trickery; in a preternaturally swift, deft, or timely manner; suddenly and surprisingly.<br/><br/>    e. like magic: without any apparent explanation; with incredible rapidity; with great ease. Cf. LIKE adv. (conj.) 1b.</code><br/><br/>So, that's just sense 1 of the word -- and you can see many of the divisions of what "feels magical" in this thread based on those definitions. Some people think natural magic when they think magic, and others thinkg the "without any apparent explination" angle. Others think of the tie between religion and magic, or the divide between religion and magic. And others think of randomness and whimsy, which the OED didn't even touch. So in this case I can only say that the OED is deficient.                        </div>

                            What I've been trying to argue, unsuccessfully, is that magic and religion in HQ are not tied together. <br/>
<br/>
Actually I'd agree with you about the barrier effect that you mention, for precisely the reasons that you mention. But it's precisely the application of rationality to magic that makes it seem unmagical. That is, if you want your magic to feel magical, you have to find the pre-rational nature of it. So, sure these people are having a hard time, but that's precisely because they're bringing either their own rationalist mindsets and putting them on the characters, or they're making the assumption that magic is as it is in other RPGs, rational.<br/>
<br/>
Now I think that I could argue that the number of people who come to HQ with the particular mindset that you're talking about that seems to be at odds with HQ are rare. I think they're rare in the world, much less in terms of people who play RPGs. But I don't even have to defend the system there, because it doesn't actually go against this mode of thinking. <br/>
<br/>
Magic in HQ only seems to be linked to religion. Yeah, the keyword entry is called the "specialized religion" keyword. But as I tried to show on a thread on The Forge, not everyone has these religion keywords. One can have a religion keyword from another nation, for instance. Or one could have none at all. But I'd still suggest that this character take a "belief" keyword to describe what it is that they do believe. Because I think that's the nature of the third keyword, that it's about belief. It's called a magic keyword, because, yeah, in Glorantha it tends to be that way. But it's not neccessarily the case. <br/>
<br/>
We haven't yet seen any official Sorcerer keywords yet (I don't think), but let's speculate on what they look like. Well, they'll look like any other Adept keyword, with a school founder, the relationships you have with people from the tradition, etc, etc. None of that has to relate back to a religion, and none of it should in most cases, because by definition sorcerers don't buy into the church or any other cosmological model. Oh, some particular groups may be intentionally "evil" in that they believe in god, or something, and act in spite of him. But this is not a requirement. <br/>
<br/>
What would the religion keyword be for these people? Well, actually, I'd argue that because of social context, and the facts of where these traditions come from in Glorantha, that, yeah, they'd have a monotheistic church keyword. But this is like the knowledge that the atheist has about Santa Claus and Christmas in general. Education that's an unavoidable part of the culture. I certainly would't require them to take the "worship god" ability  if they didn't want to do so. And, heck, if the church doesn't like them for this, their relationship with it might be "Hunted by Church." <br/>
<br/>
This is just so much cultural context. <br/>
<br/>
So, in fact, there is nothing about the magic in question that says that it has any sort of actual religious connection. Yeah, sure, the monotheists say that the sorcerers are stealing magic from god. They also say that the spirits that the Darjiini worship are actually just demons. The gods of the Orlanthi, too. <br/>
<br/>
The system could be interpreted as saying that all magic systems are true here. Or, instead, it can be interpreted as being just the system for the players' benefit, and not really saying anything about the actual cosmology. That is, just as we don't know for certain in the real world if magic works or does not, so, too is the existence of the Gloranthan. Oh, sure, he can see magic working. But does it really have a supernatural source? Maybe in Glorantha, there are nanites that simply make what you believe happen. We don't know that this is not true. And the system doesn't really tell us. <br/>
<br/>
All the system tells us is that if character A believes X, then he can do Y magical seeming thing. Can you see how that covers any belief system? <br/>
<br/>
The predilection of magic to be associated with religion in HQ is an artifact of it being set in Glorantha. Put another way, you can play completely without religion if you want in another world. Or even alter Glorantha to take out the religion if you wanted to do that for some reason. There's nothing in the system preventing you from doing this. As I pointed out, I have an atheistic magic in the world that I run in, based on that system's cosmology (which, it's interesting to note, is a traditional D&amp;D based cosmology - again I think it's canalized gamers more than people with alternate magical viewpoints).<br/>
<br/>
Even if Glorantha is "god soaked" or something, it's interesting to note that they have both sorcerers, and the God Learners as prominent counter-examples to the religious POV. The God Learners were precisely of the belief that the otherworlds and such were merely phenomenological, and that there was no supernatural nature to the world and that magic could be manipulated by them as they saw fit. So even Glorantha is not 100% religious. <br/>
<br/>
Now, I like to have some religion in my worlds. Really what it is, is that I like to have all sorts of belief systems working so that we can actually examine this sort of stuff in play. That is, for the person who personally believes that magic should be non-religious, I think that it makes sense to still have magical religions, and simply to say that they're just superstition that happens to produce magic. Again, this is precisely what everyone in Glorantha feels about the magic that everyone else has. Your god didn't put the sun in the sky, because my spirit *is* the sun. Your magic probably just comes from evil spirits who are decieving and using you. <br/>
<br/>
By having multiple belief systems in the world, no matter how much you personally don't believe in them, you get to explore the differences, and how they interact. So I think that's good. But, if a player wants a world devoid of religion, no matter how strange that may be, they can do that with HQ if they want. The system will still make that magic as magical as possible. <br/>

<code>All the system tells us is that if character A believes X, then he can do Y magical seeming thing. Can you see how that covers any belief system?</code><br/>Mike, I think we're mostly violently agreeing on most things, so I want to look at this for just a second. <br/><br/>The system of HeroQuest can most certainly do this. No question, no problem. I don't know if it can do it to everyone's satisfaction (if it could we'd never again need make a new game system), but it certainly can do it well and to the satisfaction of lots of folks. <br/><br/>The world of Glorantha likewise has a lot of room for many different types of magic and belief. However, Glorantha is less open than the system of the game that runs with it. (Thus one of the reasons for Quest Worlds.) <br/><br/>So when we talk about the capabilities and blocks of HeroQuest, I think we need to be really clear about if we are talking about "the underlying system of HeroQuest, which will be the basis for games like Quest Worlds and Mythic Russia" or if we are talking about "the structure of the world of Glorantha, which exists seperatly from HeroQuest both in existing before the current rule set and currently being published in rules sets from other companies." Because if we just say "HeroQuest" as is, in a mixed community like this, we are saying both and neither of those things at the same time.<br/><br/>Because HQ's system can probably do most magic to my satisfaction. Glorantha cannot. But then I wouldn't want Glorantha to, because any setting that tries to do all magic is going to be weak. A setting that does what it does and does it well will be much more likely to please me.<br/><br/>Also, Godlearners is an argument that doesn't give a lot of pull with me. The fact that they have historically been connected to rune usage, NPCdom, and deliberate obfuscation short-circuts my abiility to take them seriously as an example of "you can do anything in Glorantha and have it work." Maybe Robin's writeups of them for the new Runequest will change my mind though.                        </div>

                            OK, I've argued in the past that a preponderance of material that indicates something in the rules will tend to cause play to go a certain way, so I'll have to agree with you that the preponderance of the examples in HQ being what they are, that it does support a religious viewpoint, and thus may not be suitable for all players. <br/>
<br/>
Worse, I'm probably one of the only people in the world who have examined the system in enough detail to even understand what it's capable of in these terms (though I'm certainly not the only one to use it with other settings). <br/>
<br/>
But then I'll demand that you admit that the number of people for whom magic (seemingly) being associated with religion is a problem is not all that large either. Shreyas aside. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
In any case, all of this misses the overall point, which is to look at how to mechanically support magic. That is, I started out saying that it was the mechanics that did X,Y,Z that make magic feel magical. Given that I don't even play HQ in Glorantha, I thought it would be pretty obvious that what I was talking about was the mechanics. I tried to make this explicit by pointing out how they worked in different settings. I should have been more direct, apparently. <br/>
<br/>
More to the point, as always, I'm thinking about designing new games, and thinking of the question in that context (I can['t leave The Forge at home). Basically I'd only say that HQ is potentially the best RPG to date for how it supports magic, not that it can't be surpassed. Setting considerations may well be a part of this - I certainly wouldn't include Glorantha in any game I made, or would suggest others make. I'm primarily interested in how the mechanics can deliver the magical feel, because that's what's going to come into any new design. <br/>
<br/>
And it's basically very simple, have mechanics that allow one to play with the context of the magic mechanically, not simply the magic abilities themselves. So that people can feel the operant belief system behind the magic when playing. Simple as that. <br/>
<br/>
As for the Godlearners, well, even Glorantha is still recovering from D&amp;D. Greg hasn't published rules for mystics because he says that they won't make interesting PCs. But he admits that it could be done if one wanted to do so. I think that until now, the Godlearners have been somewhat of a cross between an inside joke, and seen as just outside of what RPG play can handle. <br/>
<br/>
With HQ, that may change. I'll certainly be interested to see if it happens. They beat him to it in Over the Edge, but I'm waiting for the day that some RPG character like a God Learner figures out that he's a character in a role-playing game, and *that's* where his magic comes from - you and me. <br/>

<i>And others think of randomness and whimsy, which the OED didn't even touch. So in this case I can only say that the OED is deficient.</i><br/><br/>Woo-hoo, I totally agree.  Let's remember how dictionaries come into existence--a bunch (a whole bunch) of people get together and examine patterns of word usage and then attempt to compile them in a meaningful way.  While there are really good reasons to use words carefully, that doesn't mean adherence to the dictionary.  <br/><br/>We're using living language--I started this thread to get a better tally on what sort of 'living' meanings magic has, to see where it has its roots, and where it is extending its runners into.  It's been interesting and given me some good stuff to chew over.<br/><br/>--Ian                        </div>

<p>Here's a thought:</p>
<p>In many games, "magic" isn't magic <em>within the setting.</em> But nonetheless, it feels magical (to me) because it's disaligned with the natural logic of <em>this</em> setting -- in Exalted it is basically unremarkable that I can fly by pointing my finger and shouting <em>Eagle Wing Style!,</em> or that people catch fire when you hit them with pieces of red jade, but in my head that's a magical happening.</p>

                            Shreyas, <br/><br/>Exalted magic is, mostly, natural magic (OED definition above) of a world with a different cosmology than ours, with a big dose of Orientalist flavor and Manga super-effects put in. <br/><br/>So it certainly has tone, I'll grant ya that. I personally tend to find it very cool, and very fun -- but not very magical unless I decrese the superManga and increase the Taoist alchemy.                        </div>

<p>I think it's fair to say, for example, that D&amp;D's wizards don't have to be religious in any real sense of the term--sure, their magic is hardwired to the cosmology, but the existence of a cosmology is not innately religious.</p>

<p>... and as a result, it's cold and magicless. I mean, it's artillery. It's magical color on combat attributes, that's the best thing it's for.</p>
<p>Brand, I wasn't saying that religion implies magic, just the other way around. You can have a cosmology that doesn't allow for or require magic (say, the Big Bang), of course. That's all.</p>

                            Joshua AC<br/><br/>Oh, okay then. <br/><br/>Though I'd say that while magic needs cosmology, it doesn't need religion. Belief, probably, structure, probably. Full religion? Prosibly not. <br/><br/>After all there are all sorts of fringe elements of magical practice that cluster around communities with strong religions that are certainly heterodox to the practices and beliefes of the community. So when a member of a monotheist faith goes to the amulet-maker on the old hill, it doesn't mean that the amulet-makers magic is either part of the mainstream religion (like the prayers of the faithful would be), nor that the amulet-makers magic is a part of a seperate religion (like the sacrifices of the hill tribe two days walk down the road). The magic is the "other" thing that fills some need in the world that the religion proper doesn't fill. <br/><br/>Ditto a lot of neoplatonic and hellenistic "magical" thought, in which the magic was philisophical speculation into the world (the natural magic of the OED definition) -- in which the actual religion of the practitioner was often not important to the speculation, except in so much as they felt the need to reconcile the two world views. <br/><br/>Which leads into a lot of Mike's stuff about clashes of belief and how that leads to another (and narrativly rich) type of magical thought.                        </div>

As much as we jump up and down about separating church and state -- two institutions -- the religion and politics the institutions come from are siamese twins sharing the same heart and lungs.  There is no magic that is untouched by science, and there is no politics that are untouched by religion.  All of them are simply the means by which we believe we interact with the world around us, a world composed as much by information as energy, matter, space, and time.<br/><br/>If you tell your congresswoman you're praying for her, are you being religious or political?

<p>Here's an example from my own religion:</p>
<p>We are warned against pictures of God (they're inherently inaccurate, therefore an image of something else, and therefore idolatry). We are similarly warned against worshipping angels, natural phenomena, or anything less than the primal, formless self-spawning void.</p>
<p>However, you'll see in many a Jewish house (and around a Jewish neck, and hanging from a Jewish rear-view mirror) an amulet shaped like a hand with a thumb on both sides. In the center is a piece of blue stone or a glass eye.</p>
<p>This is called a Chamseh (which sorta means "Five", diminished. "Fivey?"), the hand of God. Naturally, this "wards off the Evil Eye". Whatever. This is a magic idol, and if I were to guess at its symbolism, I'd say it's a cybernetic thing: input and output make a soul. But it's worked into the Jewish word-structure so it's part of the religion. Maybe not the religion described in Torah, but the real one that people practice, warts and all. It has a fine varnish of Jewish stuff, but that's obviously not its origin.</p>

You'll find very similar things in parts of Iran and Armenia -- probably from similar pre-current religion sources. But now they're a "not-part part" of the community in Islam and some Christian sects, as well as Judiaism. The interesting thing is that there are also, in this day and age, people that use them without belonging to any of those faiths.                        </div>

Lots of folks, however, would say that Exalted is all about wuxia kung-fu.<br/><br/>Is "magic" just a stand-in for "not like our day-to-day experience"?                        </div>

                            Shreyas, magic is like superpowers when you're talking about its role in the story.  It externalizes the otherwise implicit themes.  A game about how things are naturally connected and artificially separated would do well with magic that's all about sympathies and correspondences and contagion (hello, Tribe 8).  A game about the price of power would do well with magic where demonic powers are bound and compacted (Sorcerer).  A game about, I dunno, folktales would do well with magic that centers on tradition and legend and lore, because knowing the lore is empowering.<br/>
<br/>
Brand, I wasn't clear.  Is "magic" the stand-in for "the world of the characters is not like the world of the players."  Magic as Other is applicable to the fiction and the audience.  Magic as Other in the game world usually falls on its face, because the players all want to get the magic, and then it's not the Other any more, and the magic doesn't feel magical; it becomes assumed technology.                        </div>

                            Joshua HoldthePickle, <br/><br/>I think that "magic" often becomes like "magic" in many discussions -- something used to try and point at the elements you want, think you want, or think you do not want without being able to actually define what those things are or how they work. So you just say "magic" when what you mean is "this thing that I don't have/that I do and makes it work, but I don't understand how." <br/><br/>Which is why getting people to talk about what they think about, and want, is great. Because then you can start actually analyzing it. Kill magic with science, ya know.                        </div>

                            Right, so it should be "magic as an effect of belief." Which makes it non-other, and very salient to us. Or to me, at least. <br/>

<p>Brand, my point is that the chamseh has gained a legitimized religious purpose, whatever its origins.</p>
<p>Another example is El, one of the names for God. El is a pre-Jewish god who was, and I'm not exaggerating, a penis. You can still find altars to him out in the desert. I have a picture of my sister hugging one such idol in Israel.</p>
<p>The point is, in order to acknowledge their meaning, they're integrated into the larger religious sphere.</p>

<p>Religious orthodoxy is irrelevant to the discussion. I'm talking about the religion itself. Orthodoxy is no less a perversion and no more a pure aspect of the religion than any other perspective thereon.</p>
<p>If you spoke with a <em>religious</em> Jew Ã¢â‚¬â€ someone who actually thought about the theology of the situation Ã¢â‚¬â€ who went to a psychic or spirit-talker, they would immediately start integrating the psychicness and spirit-talkertude into their cosmology.</p>

<i>The biggest work of magic in recent memory is the internet. The most prevalent religion in the world is capitalism. The science of prayer is alive and well and being practiced and tested in labs across the planet.</i><br/><br/>These are extended metaphors, not justifications for collapsing the terms.  The terms contest each other but should not be reduced to synonyms.  It doesn't make sense to call capitalism a religion in a 'serious' sense because then we don't have the difference between them that allows us to discuss their real interactions.  <br/><br/>Collapsing terms just gets us mush, not cool stuff.  Rather than engage in rampant mushiness, I think it's far more useful to draw distinctions and uncover their interactions.  Is praying for a congresswoman political or religious?  Well, it is both, but it's both in two directions, not both converging.  That prayer emerges from a network of religious ideals and encountersa network of political ones, but does not and should not justify their identification.<br/><br/>If we want theory, let's not talk Derrida (who, in fariness, gets a bad rap from poor explanations of his work) but Bruno Latour.  If we want to talk about magic in the game, let's talk about the ways in which magic can be deployed in relationship to these other forces (politics, religion, etc.) in different ways, in interesting ways.<br/><br/><i>Magic as Other is applicable to the fiction and the audience.</i><br/><br/>On magic as Other: see, I don't think most cases of magic that I like are well-described by alterity (otherness) but by liminality--i.e. you do not come face to face with an other (big or little 'o') but find yourself along a line in which you are not firmly situated in yourself--where it is uncertain whether the forces you work with are exactly your own (agency), whether you might be able to bring them into your sphere of action, or whether they escape.<br/><br/>That sort of magic doesn't seem compromised by the players getting it--it works best when they do get it.                        </div>

Sure. <br/><br/>Monism requires transcendentalism or epiphany to understand the monistic nature of the universe. Wu-wei requires harmony or enlightenment. These states are a crossing of borders from the perceived world to the real world via meditation, practice, and other forms of ritual.<br/><br/>I'm not aware of many non-dualistic forms of magic that aren't monistic. Can you provide some examples? Do you mean pluralism? What are pluralistic beliefs of magic?                        </div>

<em>These are extended metaphors, not justifications for collapsing the terms.</em><br/><br/>I don't want to derail the discussion, Isbo, but I wasn't using the terms metaphorically.  Really and truly.  The internet is magic.  Orthodox capitalism is a religious creed, complete with holy wars.  We can talk about that further in another thread if you like.<br/><br/><em>I don't think most cases of magic that I like are well-described by alterity (otherness) but by liminality ... That sort of magic doesn't seem compromised by the players getting it--it works best when they do get it.</em><br/><br/>I disagree.  In my experience, players want to do things with the resources available to them.  If you construct the game so that the resolution of something magical may-or-may-not be attributed to player actions, they will be disappointed.  Alternately, if you put control of those forces beyond the character in the hands of the player (if the dice says it happens, it happens, whether the cause is character or something else or in between) the <em>player</em> has no sense of liminality.  It's all securely within his control.                        </div>

                            Brand, this is what Greg says about Mysticism in Glorantha, that the mystic POV is (like in our world), that the "otherworld" in question is simply the essential world that underlies the illusionary world in which we find our day to day existence occuring. Note that this makes it applicable to any other magical model, so you can have something like Sufi mystics in the Wizardry model who are percieving the Essence World (with God at the eternal end) as the essential nature of the illusionary Mundane World. In fact the namings here are not co-incidental. A more Hindu-like mysticism (think Fakirs, again, etc) can be had with perceiving the God World as the "real" world. Shamans are often so mystic that they seem to spend a lot of their time in the spirit world - they seem like the most successful mystics of all, some simply leaving the mundane world of illusion for the "real" spirit world permenantly. <br/>
<br/>
The "Cult Secret" for all of these would be, in fact, Transcendance (much like the secret learned for any Great God). <br/>
<br/>
I think this matches the real world well. The Suni will tell you that heaven is an otherworld, and that one gets to God only if they pass on after living a good life on Earth. The Sufi believe in pretty much the same god and heaven, but simply that one can experience it in life by training onself to see outside of the self (from which the illusion comes that prevents us from seeing the essential world underneath). <br/>
<br/>
Again, the fact that the nature of the Gloranthan otherworlds is not objective to the players, much less the characters, makes it possible for both beliefs to exist side by side in a way we can buy. Of course, this is belied somewhat by the whole "Inappropriate Worship" mechanic (which indicates that a god is a god, and when worshipped as a spirit by another culture doesn't provide magic as effectively), but that's another controversy, and an exception that I think proves the rule here. :-)<br/>

                            Really, the concept of otherworld is just a "true understanding" of the world -- if you look at it through an absolutist, monistic eye. That magical otherworld really isn't "other" -- you just misunderstand it as such. Come into the light...<br/><br/>Meditation is ritual. Enlightenment is the product of ritual. There are no non-ritualized magical paths. Ritual is just action that takes one from the mundane (or profane, if you prefer) to the sacred, if I can get all Eliade on you for a moment. Or at least my poor understanding of Eliade.<br/><br/>Look at D&amp;D magic. The wizard prepares spells after a good night's rest. This is a ritual done ahead of time using pages of mystical writings that cannot be understood without enlightenment (i.e., you wrote it yourself) or magic itself (the <i>read magic</i> spell). The casting is mostly a formality that takes like 6 seconds. The ritual is performed ahead of time and the caster is in a ritual state throughout.                        </div>

                            I don't care what anyone says. You can rationalize it all you want, but Magic is still a great basketball player.<br/>

Hey, is this thread going anywhere? Is this just a battle of credos? Is there a desired outcome? Just curious.                        </div>

                            Larry, <br/><br/>That would largely depend on what people say. Right now it seems to pretty much just be a freeform discussion about what we all thing about magic and what feels magical in an RPG. <br/><br/> </div>

<i>I don't want to derail the discussion, Isbo, but I wasn't using the terms metaphorically. Really and truly. The internet is magic. Orthodox capitalism is a religious creed, complete with holy wars. We can talk about that further in another thread if you like.</i><br/><br/>You find the place to stick that thread and I'll step on over--admittedly, I can be pretty hardnosed about things like this, so I'm willing to keep an open mind.<br/><br/><i>If you construct the game so that the resolution of something magical may-or-may-not be attributed to player actions, they will be disappointed. Alternately, if you put control of those forces beyond the character in the hands of the player...the player has no sense of liminality. It's all securely within his control.</i><br/><br/>I think you are largely right that this is how things work in practice--what I'm thinking, though, is that this is not a necessary state of affairs.  It seems like there should be a mechanical route that treats magic as more than just a tool, less than some big thing 'out there.'  <br/><br/>How to do this?  Well, one way might be to build the blur between player and character into the game--giving players more control without attributing it to the characters.  That still may not work, but I'm thinking I'm going to try that out and see.                        </div>

                            I once thought that the control issue was a way to make magic seem mysterious to the characters, and therefore magical, but I think that's a blind alley. I think that the important part is not having random effects or something - it's not unmagical to have relatively reliable powers. The important part is that the character not really understand how the magic is working precisely in mundane terms. He understands the source, but the fact that it works, breaking the laws of the mundane world is a mystery to him. This can only be felt by the player if he's aware of the character's feeling of the "otherworldliness" of the magic. As opposed to it looking like it's just some technology from the mundane world that could be explained if one took the time. <br/>
<br/>
Magic is impossible by the laws of nature - that's what makes it magical. If you want it to feel magical, then you have to make it feel impossible. Despite it being quite accessible for some, and understandable. Meaning you have to show it's supernatural source in the process of using it. <br/>
