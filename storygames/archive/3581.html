Are you frustrated?  What do you write - poetry, nonfiction, fiction, drama, other?  Have you been published?  Do you want to be?  How does gaming factor into all that?<br/><br/>For my part I've written all kinds of stuff, from awful lit-mag poetry to ad copy to one-act plays about Nazis, but gaming (and design, and publishing) scratches all my literary aspiration itches.  Zero frustration.  That said, I'm embarking on a new project that will involve tons of writing, and it feels great!  Irony.

The second one, whose word count was somewhere in the 80,000s, went through a year and four drafts worth of revision. I'm taking a break from it right now because I've realized that I need to rewrite the whole damn thing from a different POV, as the protagonist turned out to be someone else than I had planned. I just can't find the time to commit to it. Lisa has written five full manuscripts, one measuring in at over 250k words, and she's still working on cleaning those up.<br/><br/>I did NaNo a couple of times, successfully each time. I went to the Surrey International Writer's Conference and had chats with Terry Brooks, Teresa Nielsen Hayden, and some other writers, editors, and agents. Turns out they're real people just like everyone else <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Including bad moods, insecurities, and other issues. That was a good experience, because it made the whole field less intimidating.<br/><br/>There is some relationship to roleplaying, sure. When Lisa and I play via chat interfaces, it's more like a collaborative writing effort rather than storytelling, which is why we often play that way even when we're in the same room together. <br/><br/>But there are also traps in there, when people think that playing somehow directly translates to writing. The pacing, manner of description, points of view, focus on endless character interactions instead of concise plots, no clear endings, and so on, are vastly different in many ways.

I'm a member of SFWA (when I remember to pay my dues) and I've been published in <i>Interzone</i>, <i>The Third Alternative</i>, <i>Strange Horizons</i> and elsewhere.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.johnzo.com/agg.html?d=stories" rel="nofollow">Here's all my published fiction</a>.  I got weary of the sci-fi biz and decided to put it all online for free.   Nowadays I write and self-publish <a href="http://www.greetercomics.com" rel="nofollow">a comic</a>  and a line of <a href="http://www.comfort-guide.com" rel="nofollow">novelty safety guides</a>.  I'm having a lot of fun with those.  Comics has a long tradition of self-publishing, and it's an unparalleled joy to go to conventions and sell your very own stuff to people who are right in front of you, digging it.  I'm sure you guys can relate.<br/><br/>To bring this back to the thread -- the writing thing actually kinda hindered story-gaming for me. Writing fiction seriously meant that I spent a lot of time sitting alone in a state of frantic creation.  That level of isolation totally withered my collaboration circuits, so it became a real challenge to jam on a narrative. Used to be, if I was in a story game and I got excited about an idea, I'd want to run and run and run with that idea and be totally unreceptive to other people's input.

I've barely tried my hand at poetry since then, but the one thing I did do this year (for a theatre class of all things) everyone said was great. It seems I have natural talent, but no training.  I also dabbled in fiction, something that's also kind of faded away, but recently has become rekindled (there's even a story in my head trying to get out that's inspired by the tumor thing).  Yes, I am frustrated, but only with myself for not getting off my butt and actually committing to writing. <br><br>EDITED TO ADD: The fiction in question is mostly short, though sometimes long (or at least aspires to be long) and generally would probably be considered "speculative fiction."  I live enough in the real world to care about writing about it - new worlds are more interesting to me.<br><br>Sometimes I think my desires to write come from frustrated gaming desires - it seems the more I play story-games, the less I actually sit down to try writing (though then again, the more I watch TV, or read books, the less I want to write).  But of course that doesn't explain the poetry.  Sometimes I think it's just atmosphere - in college the first time around I was taking fiction writing classes, and surrounded by fellow artsy-writing types, and now I'm not so much.  Or it might just be age, I've wound down since I was 22 (and most of my poetry stopped before 20, so "adolescence" can explain that).  Mostly I think it's laziness and procrastination taken to ridiculous extremes.  <br><br>I am not published (well, my name is on one story on an erotic story website, so I'm technically published in the Forge sense, but it's really someone else's work and I really only edited and helped rewrite some paragraphs, so I don't think of it as "my work" even though maybe half the sentences are at least partly "mine"), but everything I've finished (mostly stuff for classes) has been lauded.  Most of my unfinished stuff got good reviews from the few people I let read them, but I'd quickly hit, like 40-50 pages, get tired of the story, and trash it.  This is the other half of frustration - the problem with being an author who doesn't enjoy and generally refuses to outline.  It winds up like those endless campaigns, winding without a clear destination in sight...<br><br>I consider setting-design (which I used to do a lot of, now not so much but dabble on occasion) and character-making (pre-sheet) to be vaguely similar to writing since both writing and game-prep can take advantage of it, but it's a separate creative animal thaneither one.  But otherwise I see these activities as very different.  Gaming is one way to make a collaborative story in almost theatrical style, certainly more-or-less orally (maybe a little less so in pbem/pbp games), but with lots of people working with you at all times, in real time.  Writing is a way to make a story more-or-less alone, or at least one-at-a-time in the case of most collaborative pieces (which is why pbem/pbp is more writing-like).  <br><br>That said, I think lessons from trying one can be translated to the other, somehow.  I think my new experiences with story-games since the Forge will help me write better stories, because I have new ways of thinking about narratives.  The actions aren't all that related apart from the edge case of pbem/pbp (in that way I agree with Ben) but I think since both are narratives, thinking about the theory of one can help the theory of the other (in a venn diagram sort of way).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80641/#Comment_80641" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T10:57:13+00:00" title="July 11, 2007 10:57AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I write socio-cultural-political research papers for a living.  I feel like I can do informative prose pretty well.<br><br/>I used to write fiction. I wrote an 86-page novella in 7th grade called The HappyVerse, based on an awful Piers Anthony-ish style.  The planet was being invaded by an alien race called Happyballs, based on Happy Fun Ball from Saturday Night Live, that were exploding yellow smiley faces.  I should find that at some point and share it with you folks.  I've written a few short stories here and there, but only a couple of them were any good.<br/><br/>I've written a few scripts for comics, though only a few of them were ever illustrated by artists.  There was Murphy's Lawmen (fate police), Here Ever After (surreal afterlife), My Father's Machine (urban greasepunk fantasy), and then a couple of things that were basically Marvel fanfic: Anansi the Spider-Man and Mojo's X.  I wrote and shot my own digital photography-based comics while I was in China, about various subjects.<br/><br/>I've written poetry from time to time.  This is better than my fiction, I think.<br/><br/>I bust rhymes, like the thing I did for Game Chef this year.  Writing lyrics is more fun than writing poetry or fiction. I write a lot of songs, some of which I score, record, and post MP3s of on my Livejournal.<br/><br/>Thanks to <a href="http://secretwars.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Secret Wars</a>, I now write more game content than anything else, probably.

A short play I wrote and put on the Internet for free has been produced about seven times in the past 10 years or so.<br/><br/>I've been writing fiction since I was 12; I finished two short novels in my teens, both pretty bad and very derivative (but probably no worse than a lot of things that get published). One was a spy-space opera, the other a very genre fantasy. It involved a quest for seven Swords of Power by a group of stock characters of various races. The few salvagable bits are coming out in my game setting Underground Railroad.<br/><br/>Last year I finished what may be my first publishable novel, though it's not published yet: <i>City of Masks</i>, for the setting of which I also wrote a small storygame. My plan at the moment is to self-publish them both in one cover.<br/><br/>Short stories and I don't get on. I recently read a definition of a novelist as a writer who can't stand to finish his short stories; that's me.<br/><br/>I wrote a lot of moderately bad poetry as a teenager as well. I've written a bit since; it's still not stellar. The best of it (along with practically all my other creative work) is on my <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com" rel="nofollow">C-Side Media</a> site.<br/><br/>I've written a number of rituals and liturgies, which is an interesting and neglected creative form. Most of them are on the site too.<br/><br/>I have a non-fiction book on spiritual growth with an agent at the moment; it got shortlisted for a manuscript award last year, so I may not have to self-publish that as well.<br/><br/>JBR: that's totally my experience of being a book editor (some years ago now).

I can write (well, from some reports), but typically don't because it's generally more work than I want to do.  Writing something that I'd actually be proud of would require a lot of time and effort, and very little fun...so I just don't.  It's not like there aren't dozens of other things that I can do with my time that have significantly lower entry costs and far greater rewards.<br/><br/>Gaming fits into that niche: I tend to use it as a place to put ideas that I <i>could</i> have used in some other creative work.  Where a real honest-to-god author might sit around thinking up plots and characters and dialogue for use in a novel, I'll do the same thing for a character I'm playing in our weekly game.  It's better for me because the deadline is much more relaxed, and because spooling out a dozen half-formed ideas is easier to do than developing one fully-formed, "publication-quality" idea would be.  (Not to mention being more useful in a game where my ideas have to shift and interact with contributions made by other people.)<br/><br/>In other words, gaming gives me a creative outlet which enables me to be lazier and less stressed-out.  Without it, I would absolutely be a frustrated writer, in the sense that I'd most likely <i>have</i> to write something, and would then feel compelled to do it <i>properly</i>, and would inevitably end up bitter and pissed off all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80818/#Comment_80818" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T07:11:23+00:00" title="July 12, 2007  7:11AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.<br/><br/>I write news, features and other non-fiction stuff for my employer's magazine and website, plus edit the lot as well.
