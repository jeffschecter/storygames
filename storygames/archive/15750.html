A Nutjob Cleric of the Four Winds and an Angsty Shadow Warrior sought adventure and eldritch lore  in a glacier-surrounded, Vampire-ruled Kingdom at the North Pole of a fantasy world.  A drunken sage was encountered, the depths of an arcane library plumbed, and unwise sermon was preached in a vampire cathedral and a whale fell from the sky for no apparent reason.  Also much stew was eaten, much raw alcohol was consumed, checkers was played with a dragon and and an inter-dimensional dungeon popped up from nowhere.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357302/#Comment_357302" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T05:43:23+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  5:43AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2012 6:20AM by Harlequin.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (edited for spelling... oops)<br/><br/>Lies Lies and Lies!<br/><br/>Xhenyu (the Sparrow) and Yu-Chen (the Horse) return to the tea shop to discover it's on fire!  The Panda who runs it rushes out to them to enlist their help.  It's not that the tea house is on fire, it's the "Five Assassins... I mean, Warriors... I mean... Thugs in there.  They're looking for you... I mean, they've already found your companion Kian Hwe!  He's in trouble!  He might burn alive!  There just men looking for money."<br/><br/>What made the session stand out was that I told them flat out that the Panda was lying to them, but that they would need to roll to see through it.  And as players, three of them chose not to roll dice.  They chose to have their characters convinced by the lie.  And they maintained that separation of knowledge for the rest of the night.  Little things like that make me <i>so happeh!</i><br/><br/>In other news...\n<blockquote>Xhenyu rushed away from the tea house to find Nanwu (his former master) and discovered her meditating over Kian Hwe's unconscious body.  Xhenyu asked about Kian Hwe, and why Nanwu wasn't assisting with the tea house fire.<br/><br/>"Xhenyu, we need to leave." she patiently intoned.  "Your companions will only slow us down, and they have brought the Duke's Assassins to our heels.  Abandon them and follow me through the old paths, and we can live."<br/><br/>Xhenyu nervously considered his options, just as Kian Hwe (finally passed his rolls) and woke up.<br/><br/>.. awkward...<br/><br/>"He's dead weight and we can't afford to carry him.  And his slave has too big a mouth." Nanwu continued, and all three of them nodded in agreement: master, pupil, and barely conscious Kian Hwe.<br/><br/>"But he saved my life" Xhenyu started.<br/><br/>"And I owe mine to another" Kian Hwe finished as he shook himself to standing and began shambling towards the tea house.<br/><br/>... a blink of time later ...<br/><br/>Kian Hwe took a sweeping attack to the abdomen and collapsed to his knees, dropping his noble sword in his own blood.  His own assailant finally succumbed to the smoke and collapsed unconscious.  Xhenyu tried desperately to take down the other, the Boar, but he couldn't pierce his armor and thick hide.  The Boar lifted Kian Hwe's broken body and ran from the tea house, trailing blood through the streets.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Nanwu left the city walls and blended into the brush.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357373/#Comment_357373" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T13:21:37+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  1:21PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2012 1:23PM by johnzo.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D4E, session 45, "The Gardener."<br/><br/>The Gardener is a reskinned sea kraken who nests in the cold sleep facility of the crashed Rhennee starship <i>Odyssey</i>.<br/><br/>It treasures its patches of mouthgrass and likes to keep them well fed, so it regards the band of adventurers who are exploring <i>Odyssey</i> as a great convenience!<br/><br/>I had fun during this session, but I feel grind creeping in.

So she decides to seduce the boss as well, but what is this foreplay stuff? Why doesn't he just take her? And when Lydia comes in, in the middle of things, she doesn't see why it bothers her boss so much. And afterwards, when she asks her boss to fire Laura, she doesn't understand why she's the one who gets fired. "But - but <i>my </i>scent is on you now, just like hers was..."<br/><br/>And, the ultimate revenge on a gay-basher: Crow the Fae seduces Chuck, the bully football player who used to torment him in high school. They get a room. Afterwards, Crow uses 'manipulate' to get the football player to admit he's always been gay. "I'm ... I'm gay?" Chuck cries. And then, Crow uses his sex move to ask Chuck to promise he'll come out of the closet. But no, Chuck isn't ready for that, so Crow gets two strings on him.<br/><br/>Later, though, when Lydia the witch is in her darkest self, she hexes Chuck to tell the truth, and because she's darkest self and the hex had unfortunate side effects, Chuck just won't stop talking about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_357666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357666/#Comment_357666" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T16:42:43+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  4:42PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do not do it because it is right.

Ernest inherited all the family money, Imelda got none, and he refuses to share. She gets by working at the department store in the jewellery section; she's been stealing bracelets and necklaces here and there, but she's planning on taking home a larger quantity soon by doctoring the shipping invoices so nobody will know the jewels are even missing. Ernest is a rich playboy who hangs around with crooks and organizes heists for the fun of it. He has an unhealthy obsession with Frankie the waitress, who is stringing him along in hopes that she can steal the take from his next heist. Turns out his next heist is a sadistic plan to have a couple of his goons rob the department store and pin it on his sister Imelda, whom Frankie has already witnessed stealing from the store.<br/><br/>The night before the Ernest's heist, Imelda sneaks into the department store after hours to doctor the invoices. Frankie follows Imelda into the store, and Ernest follows Frankie, stalker-style. Ernest trips an alarm and hides, but Imelda spots Frankie and when the cops show up she uses her status as an employee to pin it on Frankie. After the coast is clear, she confronts Ernest, who confesses that he was plotting a heist (but leaves out that the wheels are already in motion for it to go down tomorrow). Frankie grows a conscience and turns herself in to the police, hoping to reveal Ernest and Imelda's larcenous activities, but they throw her in a holding cell. <br/><br/>The next day, (while the store is closed for Sunday), Ernest's goons catch Imelda sneaking in again to finish what she started the night before, and force her to let them in. The goons, being none to bright, decided to bring dynamite with them to blow up the safe, which was never part of Ernest's plan. A big explosion in downtown New York on a Sunday causes the city to go crazy, and after a short chase Imelda gets taken in by the police. Against all odds, Ernest's goons get away scot free, and he reaps the profits. Both Frankie and Imelda get put away in the slammer - doing time makes Imelda harder, but Frankie just goes to pieces. A couple months later, when Ernest comes to visit his sister at the women's penitentiary and gloat, Frankie screams and begs him to help her, but he looks at her with distaste, the very sight of her in such a state curing him of his obsession - he leaves her to rot.<br/><br/>Ten years pass, and a tougher, meaner Imelda emerges from prison, armed with new criminal connections and a voracious appetite for revenge. Meanwhile, at his summer home in Nantucket, Ernest lounges happily with a harem of red-headed girls who look an awful lot like Frankie. He has no idea that his sister is coming for him...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357958/#Comment_357958" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T00:02:38+00:00" title="February  6, 2012 12:02AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Over dinner tonight, some roommates &amp; friends suggested we should play <i>Monsterhearts</i>. So we jumped in right after clearing away the dishes. Of the four players, only one is an experienced roleplayer (the others have played a single structured-freeform game, and that's it). It went really well, and they're stoked to play again.<br/><br/>Best 1.5 scenes:<br/><br/>Party at Kara's. Cassidy (the mean werewolf chick) decides that this party sucks and Kara is an asshole, so she's going to go trash some bedrooms upstairs. She's surprised to find Kara's dad is at home, secluded in his bedroom watching Saturday Night Live and pretending that his daughter's party isn't out-of-control. Quickly revising her revenge plan, Cassidy seduces Kara's dad (Rudy), and then convinces Rudy to kick everyone out and shut the party down. He does, and then returns to his bedroom, and he and Cassidy have some growly sex that Kara can't help but hear.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kara's trying to score with Marcell (the vampire lacrosse player). He came to the party straight from the hospital, where they put his arm in a cast after he sustained a lacrosse injury. "The doctor give you anything for the pain?" she asks. "Yeah, T3s." "Do you think they could fuck us up? Like, should we take some and get wasted?" So they take a couple T3s and drink some more. Kara turns to Marcell and says, "I'm getting pretty sloppy, so... if we're going to do this, we should do it now." Marcell's player nods, about to describe how Marcell takes Kara right there on the couch. Then he glances at the Vampire's Sex Move. When you deny someone sexually, take a String on them. So, instead, Marcell says, "You know what? I've had a long night, and I really just want to get wasted and hang out. We should just put on another episode of friends, okay?"<br/><br/>A defeated Kara sets up the next episode of Friends. Marcell gains more power over her. The two of them sit there staring at the TV, the sound barely audible over the loud sex that Cassidy's having with Kara's dad in the next room.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357984/#Comment_357984" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T07:50:36+00:00" title="February  6, 2012  7:50AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>Cassidy seduces Kara's dad</blockquote>\nMonsterhearts: the game of seducing people's dads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K." title="Ethan K."><img alt="Ethan K." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2475/3619178655_cd765940c5_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K.">Ethan K.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358007/#Comment_358007" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T09:22:13+00:00" title="February  6, 2012  9:22AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mister Proper is flustered.

The biker girls begin to wail, and the sounds of mourning fill the town. <br/><br/>In the other room, Lark, the leader of the Tongues, spills her blood into Cookie's mouth, and he is healed. <br/><br/>Other bloody details: Tomago's gang steals boards off of the town's houses to build a funeral pyre. One of her girls is seduced by the Tongues in their pleasure yurt, and then has her hair chopped off for fucking outside of the biker gang. Proper does his best to maintain the reputation of his center of learning, and hauls a drugged-up student back to the Commonwealth. Lark sees the whole of the world slipping into the sea, kills a junkie to amplify her connection to The Murmur, and begins to plan the next cannibal blood frenzy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358032/#Comment_358032" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T10:43:51+00:00" title="February  6, 2012 10:43AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dungeon World via Google hangout: Austin/Durham/Turin/Milan. I build this "fetch it" quest dungeon, with the added spice that only one can return with the McGuffin and will become the new Duke or Duchess. A suspicious wizardly vizier is int he mix as well, waiting int he wings. My plan was to have him come down and betray them once they located the McGuffin.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1fFzQS72HsiQN1iPUKXx5lzhX2HSn0UwoxbjhAOjWahk/edit" rel="nofollow"> I build a map and cover it with black boxes, revealing as they explore</a>, it felt very old skool. <br/><br/>Half an hour in the evil thief gets killed by ravenous fire beetles! GIulia decides she'll return to the action as the vizier, happily derailing my "betrayal by evil vizier" plan but basically doing it herself. <br/><br/>Traps are triggered! Levels are upped! The ranger cleverly frees the McGuffin from its undead owner, only to die beneath a horde of his own undead ancestors! The dwarven cleric dies, too, but Death makes him a deal. He agrees to avenge the insult all this undead nobs are to Death, by destroying the necromancer who made them. In the process the cleric swaps alignment and makes a deal with the evil vizier - the vizier gets to be the new Duke, but the cleric gets to overlay an evil theocracy on top of it. They are both good with that. Problem solved.<br/><br/>I liked playing with distant friends. Google hangouts worked flawlessly, at least for a fairly low RP game like Dungeon World.

Some context:<br><br>My guy, Tima, has murdered Boris Zolatov's son Nicholai, my romantic rival and a total dick. I let Boris know I can "recover his son's body from the bandits and wreckers who slew him" for two ration cards. He agrees and swears eternal vengeance. My guy laughs.<br><br>Galina, the girl my guy just killed for, has an eager beaver 11-year-old brother, Kostya, who idolizes me. He follows me surreptitiously and gets busted by my gangster friends, who want him killed. I convince them to bring him into the gang, with the understanding that my own life is forfeit if he fucks up. OK.<br><br>Later, I go to the NKVD and rat out my gangster buddies, pretending to be Nicholai and using his papers. I'm off scott-free! Awesome! Kostya, too!<br><br>Many good scenes, but the best, fulfilling a "next week on" ... the NKVD (same guys I talked to) show up and accuse Kostya of Nicholai's murder. Boris stares me down and grins. I can take the rap and get executed, or I can let an 11-year-old die. My issue is "Courage", and in that moment I know Tima is a coward down to his bones. In the end Granny Yuliya takes the fall - she still has the murder weapon on her - leaving Tima in shame and Kostya confused but alive.

The PC cleric of the "Elder Elemental Eye" (not really) wants to sacrifice her for more XP, as well as the half-orc death mage they promised her to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, the fighter PC goes off hunting for her allies ("the most dangerous game") as they ran off into the mountains.  He hopes to gain some XP by convincing the half-orc hunter and scarthane - allies of the death mage - to join him.  They talk, he learns about their goals, and the DM learns about their goals too.  The fighter randomly encounters the goblin patrol guarding their lair, which is in the hex, and negotiates with their leader for the men he's hunting.  In exchange for the men the fighter agrees to close a shadow portal, where the goblin leader lost his ten wives.  The DM notes that he has to detail the hex that holds the shadow portal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe PC cleric returns to the hex where they plan to build their own settlement.  The half-orc death mage starts to raise a gravehound in order to protect him while he sleeps.  He gets jumped by the PCs anyway.  The cleric, aided by henchmen, attempt to subdue the death mage so she can get more XP by sacrificing him to the "Elder Elemental Eye" (not really).  Deadly battle; at one point the death mage curses the cleric, and she nearly gets dragged to the abyss when he attempts to kill himself.

Before he could complete his mission, he died (the Faction roll was a total bust).<br><br>Tonight, the PCs found the nuke.<br><br>So... now they have a nuke.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363836/#Comment_363836" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T10:05:14+00:00" title="February 29, 2012 10:05AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2012 10:06AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>900 Days</i>, S1EP05. Galina's spotlight episode. End of season.<br><br>Her issue is <i>hope </i>and all the "next week on" pointed to some big reveals. Her in a wedding dress. Her in a more intimate situation with Nicholai as a flashback. Well, be obvious, right? Turns out they'd been doin' it, and they were secretly married a few days before my guy put one in Nicholai's dome. <i>Awkward.</i><br><br>The whole episode focused on getting the four children of the Kommunakla out of Leningrad - on the train to Lake Ladoga and from there across the ice road to maybe-safety. Galina had scored four tickets. My guy, rat-faced loser that he is, tries to make nice with Galina (who hates him), and takes all the food and money she saved up to grease the wheels at the train station. His secret plan is to get on the train himself, possibly dressed like a little girl.<br><br>The Party-perfect Zolatovs, who have lost both Nicholai and his dad, grab the tickets and sneak out early - Mom is going with them and they'll sell the fourth ticket. We chase them down! Galina finds them and bullies Mrs. Zolatov into relenting. Complications ensue but all four children get on the train. Then my guy Tima shows up! He's arranged to hide in the caboose, but at the last second he changes his mind and tries to get Galina to go instead - she's given up literally everything and she'll die if she stays. He loves her. It's very touching. She totally refuses Tima and rejects him. Her job is done, the kids are safe. It feels very Tolstoy.<br><br>Then the NKVD show up for Tima. Galina holds him close and whispers, "who killed Nicholai?" Tima, honest for once, tells her that he did, and she stabs him with his own knife. The NKVD just shrug and walk away, leaving him to bleed out and her to starve. <br><br/>THE END                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363968/#Comment_363968" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T13:57:58+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  1:57PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lamarckian Kobold Quest (working title) playtest.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had two members of a small kobold hole explore their environs in an attempt to find healing properties of mold and develop the begginings of rat-husbandry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is mostly about problem solving - getting food, building traps, making sense of things.
