                    Like it says really, note any game is fine, including non-rpgs as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>I'll list three, more than that and it gets a bit tedious.<br/><br/>PTA.  It just seems like concentrated awesome, plus that Deep in the Blue thread really changed how I see games like this.  If it can produce that, I want to play it.  Reason not so far, it's not really the kind of thing my group would be into and nobody is running it at cons here.<br/><br/>Oh for a London indie con.  And I know I could set one up myself, but I really don't have the time sadly.<br/><br/>Wushu.  This, like PTA, changed my views on how rpgs could work.  It's the essence of emulative roleplaying, pure story with a very cool mechanical support structure.  Same reasons for not trying it as PTA.<br/><br/>Spycraft 2.0.  Obviously a very different kind of choice.  My understanding is that as rules robust games go this is a particularly fine example, that it really advances the craft in terms of this type of game and is just much more sophisticated than the other games in its class.  Reason for not playing this one, ironically while the others are too light and different this is too trad and heavy.<br/><br/>So, what about you?  What game or games would you most like to play that you haven't?  And why the hell haven't you?                </div>

Max, come to Dragonmeet in December. There'll be a definite indie presence there: I gather various of the British designers have clubbed together and got themselves a stall.<br/><br/>I want to play Best Friends (which I'll run at Dragonmeet); the Shab al-Hiri Roach (can't believe I haven't played it); Cold City and Sorceror.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Sorcerer - Partially want to play it just because it is referenced so much and is obviously an RPG milestone, partially because the idea of binding demons is just sweet. Haven't played yet because I don't have a copy, it is a big undertaking I hear, and because I've got a lot of games to play right now.<br/><br/>Cold City - Want to play it because the whole setting is freaking awesome, and the tensions would be great. Haven't suggested it to my game group because I don't feel comfortable GMing a historically-rooted setting... especially with people older than me (and thus closer to the time in history). I feel intimidated by working with history too closely.<br/><br/>Covenant - Love the premise, having trouble finishing the book (simply because I keep getting sidetracked.)<br/><br/>The Prince's Kingdom - Played the game once with Clinton GMing. I want to play again so damn bad. Once I get it, though, I'm not sure if the group I play with would like it or not.<br/><br/>IN SUMMARY<br/>Sorcerer - Don't have the book, and I think learning it would be a big undertaking.<br/>Cold City - Afraid to run a historically-rooted game.<br/>Covenant - Haven't finished the book.<br/>TPK - Unsure if my group would like it (plus, don't have the book yet.)                        </div>

<p>I'd like to try a couple just to see how they work. Dogs in the Vineyard, PTA (I don't even have these, yet.) A couple I have, but haven't had a chance to play: Inspectres, Universalis, My Life With Master.</p>
<p>I haven't played them because of time/place/people constraints. Most of my gaming has been at conventions and when visiting distant friends. I suppose this means I should travel more, to get in more gametime. I've seriously considered the plan of playtesting my own games by running them as events at conventions, since it seems too hard to find people with schedules that mesh and (now) a place to play.</p>

<a href="http://www.realms.co.uk/?page_id=5" rel="nofollow">Points over here</a>.<br/><br/>Yeah, there are plans for rocking Dragonmeet. <br/><br/>Back at the point. I still haven't played Shab al-Hiri Roach, despite several attempts that fell through due to disorganisation. More Shock: needs to be had too. My re-instating of Indie Gaming Monday should solve both these issues, or maybe random afterhours at Spiel.<br/><br/>On the non-RPG side, Villainy (card game from Human Head) has been sitting waiting to be played since GenCon. Yet somehow it's never quite been the right moment.                        </div>

                            Top of the list is Burning Empires. The main reason I haven't started yet is because my life has been a bit too crowded to feel comfortable starting a longer-term game. It's entirely possible that it won't happen until the New Year, but BE <i>will</i> be the next campaign I start.<br/><br/>Also, Spirit of the Century. As cool as having the PDF early is, I have a feeling I probably won't really sink my teeth into the text until the paper copy arrives. I expect that awesome pulp-ness will ensue shortly thereafter.                        </div>

                            I think about this all the time, because I love to game but there's never enough time.<br/><br/>BREAKING THE ICE - I want to play it because it will be my girlfriend's first entry to gaming, and a girlfriend who's okay with, or even enjoys, gaming is a good thing.  We've created 1.5 characters so far, but we just haven't had the same inclination at the same time to, like, actually play.  Gettin' there.  She likes it so far.<br/><br/>DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS 3.5 - Because I sank a lot of time into learning the rules and statting stuff up, and I've spent a lot of time learning about medieval Europe anyway.  But this is ultimately a dollar-auction, just with time instead of money.  I want to play, but not for any reason that withstands scrutiny.<br/><br/>MECHATON - because I like Lego's.  Haven't played it yet because my Lego-friends don't game, and my gaming-friends don't Lego.  <br/><br/>There are also a couple of games I've played, like, once or even one-half a session, and would very much like to play more: Capes, Primetime Adventures, Shadow of Yesterday, Sorcerer, and Trollbabe.  Because they are all pure, concentrated awesome.  But since our group meets maybe once every two weeks at best, it's hard to get moving on these.                        </div>

                            HOW TO FIND LEGO-FRIENDS (in five easy steps over a 30 year period)<br/><br/>Step 1.  Find a kid in your neighborhood.  Make sure his parents never let him have any good toys, in his estimation.<br/><br/>Step 2.  Befriend this kid in high school.  <br/><br/>Step 3.  When this kid drops out of college, and finds some entry level jobs, do not scoff when he blows money that should go to rent (or resuming his education) on the toys he never had.<br/><br/>Step 3A.  Particularly do not scoff when he finds a way to engage in arbitrage in Toys R Us "Jeffrey Dollars" to turn US$15 into TRU$150, repeated ad nauseum to create a potentially infinite toy-stream.  Hint: never analyze his opportunity costs.<br/><br/>Step 4.  Watch in horror as he turns another friend of yours, the one with more money than he knows what to do with and always seemed so practical, into another toy-collector.  <br/><br/>Step 4A.  When the three of you are visiting, do not complain too voiciferously that you are wandering the aisles of the local Toys R Us looking for "sweet deals", even though you are all over 25.<br/><br/>Step 4B.  Do not point out that while you do not collect toys, you do have a girlfriend, and that you suspect there may be a correlation.  <br/><br/>Step 5.  After several years of scamming, searching, and spending, your two friends will amass a large quantity of useless, vaguely shameful crap.  Yet among this nonsense will be... LEGOS, the one thing that makes you say, "Gee, I would like to disapprove of this whole deal, but... but... LEGO's!  Gentlemen, I applaud you!"<br/><br/>(Optional Step 6.  When you discover Mechaton, and have an urge to play so bad that you can't contain yourself, don't murder them when they say, "Nah, looks stupid.")                        </div>

                            Two games at the top of my list:<br/><br/>Weapons of the Gods - Ran the intro adventure last March and it was fantastic. Haven't played since then mostly because of time and scheduling constraints.<br/><br/>Burning Empires - Haven't played mostly because I just got it and friends are only now getting it. <br/><br/>I'd be setting up a campaign with both of these if I weren't moving away soon! <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

<b>Don't Rest Your Head</b>. This game is rocking my world. It's probably the best game I've picked up in the past year, and the fact that I haven't played it yet is criminal.

I love the pulps, and this is the best pulp game ever made. 'Nuff said.<br/><br/><b>Cold City</b>. Because I love Hellboy and all things monster-huntery. Plus, Cold War paranoia and betrayal. Rock.

Because nothing has made me want to break out Sorcerer more than this.<br/><br/><i>Why I'm not playing them</i><br/>Because I'm already gaming at almost full capacity. These are in the queue, but it's a looong queue.<br/><br/><i>Games that were on this list but I recently played them</i><br/>Contenders, Burning Empires, Shooting the Moon, Galactic.                        </div>

                            Shock: the simplicity and fictional focus of this game made me want to play it instantly. Everything about it is cool - the way it looks, its format, the play structure, even the *ographies.<br/><br/>Contenders: I had a blast reading it, because I was expecting exactly nothing. I am not sure whether it's an advantage to have played MLWM beforehand or not.<br/><br/>Burning Empires: read it, loved it. Its crunchyness scares the hell out of me, but the Infection Mechanics really appeal to me.<br/><br/>Cold City: I play regularly with Malcolm, and of course I want to play his game with him. It's a brilliant read as well.<br/><br/>Polaris: one the games I haven't played yet, but should have, together with MLWM. I haven't been able to find more than one other person who would like to try it. Sad, really.<br/><br/>And the following two, which are not out yet:<br/>Verge and Spione: Story Now in Cold War Berlin. Have read the playtest versions of both, and they both kick ass.<br/><br/>Per                        </div>

                            Before I begin, let it be known that this blanket reason contributes to the reason I haven't played, in ALL cases to some degree: My regular group is a pretty trad (and fairly incoherent) group that's never so much as whiffed a Foge Hippie Game, and we have little time or energy to divert to trying new games.<br/><br/>Now:<br/><br/><b>Capes:</b> I've read the Capes Lite version and gone through the Flash tutorial on the website--and this game looks so rockingly rocking that no mortal can stand in the face of its rockingness. The radical way of sharig story creation, the perfect fit to its big, bold, superhero inspiration, and the slick, punchy way that it makes you compete for your vision all have me drooling over this game.<br/><br/><i>Why not?</i> Haven't found time or opportunity to organize one yet, but the Lite rules and their awesome "Teaching" presentation make it entirely posible to play a pickup game, which I hope to do soon, either with folks from my regular group, or some non-gamer friends who I think might enjoy it.<br/><br/><b>Dogs in the Vinyard:</b> The raise and see mechanics for escalation sound super awesome for edge-of-seat tension building. The moral judgment aspect seems like it would make for pretty powerful story creation.<br/><br/><i>Why not?</i> Well, I just ordered and recieved my copy (as well as Sorcerer, and about time for both!", and haven't read it yet. Also, the concept seems like a tough sell, in a "no, no, it sounds wierd but it's cool" sort of way, but I think I could overcome that, and the modular nature of it's Town-scenario structure makes it also good for pickup, "hey let's try this" play.<br/><br/><b>Shadows of Yesterday:</b> This game seems like it would provide some nice "classic fantasy gaming' like my group is accustomed to, but which would address the problems I have with D&amp;D play. Keys rock the house!<br/><br/><i>Why not?</i> I actually had a hard time warming up to mechanics like the Keys and the Pool Refresh scenes, since they seemed kinda forced to me. (though if I HAD been satisfied on first read, I might not have searched further and discovered Heroquest!) But I came back to it through some rockin' Actual Play reports (Joao Mendes, repreSENT!), which showed me how to actually use these concepts for sizzlin' play. Might be hard to work in though; our several "classic fantasy" campaigns are run by other GMs, who are quite happy with D&amp;D I think. And for myself I want to run Heroquest next. But Shadows is an itch that needs scratching, at least <i>some</i>day. . .<br/><br/>Speaking of which, <b>Heroquest live and in person:</b> the IRC game on Tuesdays with Vaxalon and friends is cool, but it's play with strangers over chat, so it lacks that in-person, vocal and body language and facial expression and cameraderie vibe. And I'm dying to see if HQ is as fantabulous for running a Middle Earth game as I think it is.<br/><br/><i>Why not?</i> I need to finish my Over the Edge game first, and though I've told everyone up front I'm looking to wrap up everyone's stories, it still may take awhile to do so organically.<br/><br/><b>Mechaton</b> oh my GOD, this game makes me cream my inner-child drawers. it's the most brilliant thing to do with Legos EVAR.<br/><br/><i>Why not?</i> Need to compile legos for mech construction, plus find time to sit down to play (and friends who have same)<br/><br/>That's what occurs to me off the top of my head.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>

I like innocence.<br/><br/>I want to play Full Light, Full Steam because, as someone said out there on the Net somewhere (found it while Googling): "You got your steam. You got your punk. You got your space, and your pirates. What more do you want?" Also the Thematic Batteries mechanic sounds like it would rock.<br/><br/>I want to play 1001 Nights because I like traditional stories, and because Meguey is cool so I assume her game is too.<br/><br/>My reason for not playing these is that I don't have a gaming group at the moment.

                            Top of the list is <strong>Burning Empires</strong>, though I will be running it as an event at Chicago Gameday. I tried to sell my HERO group on giving it a shot, but a) they tried BWr and didn't like it at all ("This Duel of Wits stuff gets in the way of the roleplaying"), and 2) because the Infection mechanics made one player say "This sounds too much like a an RTS game."<br/><br/>As for the rest of the list... it's too long, and the reasons are the same: current groups have no interest in playing anyting other than D&amp;D and HERO, respectively.                        </div>

It does at my table.  <br/><br/>Cold City, Burning Empires, Hero's Banner, Agon, Mu and Shooting the Moon are top of my list at the moment.  The reason they're not getting played is that my group is almost entirely composed of enthusiastic GMs, so the game backlog is truly epic.                        </div>

                            I want to play <b>Lacuna Part 1</b> the most of my huge stack of unplayed games. I haven't played it yet, because we are having such a rocking time playing Dogs in the Vineyard, and I've been away from gaming with my first bout of cluster headaches.<br/><br/><b>InSpectres</b> is a game I picked up over the summer, and it just rocks. Damn what a fine game, but it is a hard sell with my regular group, as they're not into humor roleplaying.<br/><br/>Lastly I want to give <b>The Burning Wheel</b> a try, and haven't played only due to scheduling. As soon as my old D&amp;D buddies can get together - and not convince me to play more DitV - we'll give this one a go.<br/><br/>The list is so much longer, but those are at the top of it.                        </div>

                            I still really want to play <b>octaNe</b>, mainly because the setting is concentrated Awesome. It's mainly been a matter me getting off my butt to re-read the rules, plan stuff out, and get my friends together.<br/><br/><b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b> is another one. I'm a little leery of trying to run it with a group that includes a Jehovah's Witness, a Catholic, and a cynical atheist (I have such interesting friends), but I suspect it would totally be worth it. Also, I need to get around to buying a print copy so I can properly sit down and read it.<br/><br/>I've been wanting to give <b>OVA</b> a try, to see how it really works in practice, but that would require thinking up some kind of anime-inspired thing, and then not winding up wanting to design a whole new game around it.<br/><br/>I finally got around to organizing a second game night (in addition to our long-term campaign) for trying out different, crazy stuff (this week: more Tokyo Heroes playtesting, some time soon, trying out the legendary <a href="http://neko-rpg.blogspot.com/2006/11/who-ya-gonna-call.html" rel="nofollow">WEG Ghostbusters RPG</a>). If it works out, I'll finally get around to trying out the aforementioned games, more playtesting, and Panty Explosion, MLX, InSpectres, Cat, MLWM, etc., and getting them all used to roleplaying really weird shit in the process.                        </div>

                            For me the list is actually worryingly lengthy!  For almost all of them the reason 'not' basically comes down to a lack of personal time and a limited group where no one really enjoys GMing or has the time to do any decent prep work.  Hopefully that last part is changing for the <b>Burning Empires</b> game that we've just begun; it's seeming good so far anyway!  The length of the list itself is also something of a problem.  I really don't have a huge amount of free time so I simply don't get the chance to play that many games.<br/><br/>So, my games:<br/><br/><b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b><br/><br/><i>Why?</i><br/>Because I love the concept behind the game and the way it is written.  I consider it to be one of the most concentrated distillations of awesome GMing advice ever and I'd love to play out the resolution mechanics.  The poker-like bidding just seems very interesting to me and feels like, after a couple of tries, it would be extremely intuitive and flow really well.  Plus the whole moral judgement angle and player-GM interaction feels <i>right</i> to me.<br/><br/><i>Why not?</i><br/>The reasons above pretty much cover it, with the note that it would almost certainly be me GMing it and, I'll be honest here, I <i>hate</i> GMing.  My family life always leaves me feeling too drained in the very limited free time that I do have to actually want to do any prep for a game, even the small amount that DitV would require, and I'm just not comfortable in the GM role.<br/><br/><b>The Mountain Witch</b><br/><br/><i>Why?</i><br/>Like DitV the concept of the game really gels for me and I really like the way that it's written.  The main selling point for me, though, has got to be the trust mechanics and dark secret cards.  They seem like they would really ramp up the tension and emotional investment in the game (and AP threads that I've read seem to bear that assumption out) and I'd love to experience them myself...<br/><br/><i>Why not?</i><br/>...as a player.  Again it's a game that I'd almost certainly have to run myself and my comments for DitV and at the start of this post are relevant here as well.<br/><br/><b>Sorcerer</b><br/><br/><i>Why?</i><br/>The essence of the game, the conflict between humanity and personal power, is one that I'd love to experiemnt with in play.  The mechanics seem very cool and I definately feel like it's a game that I really <i>should</i> try out at some point just because, well, it's <i>Sorcerer!</i><br/><br/><i>Why not?</i><br/>Ugh.  I feel like a record on repeat here but it's the same as DitV and tMW.  I hate GMing and it's the case that to experience it I'd need to run it myself and I have neither the time nor, to be frank, the inclination to do so.<br/><br/><b>Weapons of the Gods</b><br/><br/><i>Why?</i><br/>Sheer kung fu awesomeness coupled with the genius of Rebecca Borgstrom (I'm a massive Nobilis fan) and sweet, if relatively crunchy cf my usual tastes these days, mechanics make for a game that I'd love to participate in.  Flipping out with the magnificently named techniques, destroying the reputations of courtiers and nobles with the Secret Arts, what's not to love?<br/><br/><i>Why not?</i><br/>As above, I'd be having to run it and don't have the time or inclination to prep the game, especially as WotG would require more prep than, say, DitV or tMW.  My aversion to GMing games is a real problem with regards to my ability to play the games that I'd like to given the size of my group (myself, 1 friend from my uni days and my 14 year old step-son who is even more averse to GMing than I am) and the lack of a natural 'GM-type' within the dynamic.  I just wish that Andrew (Kenrick) lived closer (he's another old uni friend) as he loves putting on the GM hat!<br/><br/><b>Blue Rose</b><br/><br/><i>Why?</i><br/>I actually enjoy Mercedes Lacky and like the setting for the world of Aldea.  That combined with the novel and interesting take on traditional d20 mechanics (adapted and updated for True20) makes Blue Rose a game I'd really like to try out.<br/><br/><i>Why not?</i><br/>This one isn't actually a game that I'd likely have to run as my friend in the group (a guy called Jan) also owns the books and enjoys the settings.  Whilst he's not a massive fan of GMing himself he is more prepared to do it than I am.  As such I think that the only reason that we haven't played this yet is that we just haven't got around to it thus far!  That and, much as I may dislike it, it's going to be my turn to GM next as Jan prefers to play too and it would be unfair to foist all GMing duties upon him.<br/><br/>Of course that list doesn't cover all of the games that I'd love to try and don't even <i>own</i> yet but I figure that it will do for now!                        </div>

                            Dogs in the Vinyard -- This seems to be a popular one.  I want to play it because the mechanic makes sense and the concept is just HELLA cool -- it pushes all of my buttons.

                            Keith, Matt:<br/><br/>If you ever come to Toronto, I will run 9W or CoS for you. Because I'm brazen, yo.<br/><br/>As a note, I used to have the same problem with Tribe 8. But Mo finally ran a game of it for me.

                            1st Quest. Because it's not yet written -- well, not yet finished / available in playtest. (Okay, technically cheating, as Judd did run a demo/playtest, but it's still top of my list.)<br/>
Dark Alleys. Because I want someone other than me to run it.<br/>
Don't Rest Your Head. Because I've not yet finished reading it, plus I want to see Dark City first.<br/>
Weapons of the Gods. Because I've not yet finished reading it.<br/>
Wyrd is Bond. Because someone other than me would have to gm that one.<br/>

I got to play this weekend before last. Kickass book, kickass setting and premise ... I think it was horribly let down by the GM though, who seemed more interested in the history than the game. I'd love to play it with a better GM though!                        </div>

Yup, I'm totally with you there. Always the GM, never the bride ... or something similar ;-)                        </div>

                            Top of my list is<b> Dogs in the Vineyard</b> (as with most people, by the looks of it). I've only just got it, and it rocks majorly. I really want to try it as written, as well as in another wacky setting like Jedi in the Spaceyard or something. As for why not, out of my 4 groups, 3 are long term campaigns, and the 4th is a little ... unsuitable, I feel.<br/><br/>Second up is <b>1001 Nights</b>, which is pure story games goodness distilled into one very tasty package. I mean, big bowls of dice, stories told in the Sultan's Palace and courtly intrigue all rolled into one! Why not ... same reason as above, unfortunately. With the added bonus reason that my serious rl group aren't really into "story games," preferring more mainstream, traditional games. Although I did get them to play both MLWM and Burning Empires.                        </div>

                            Oh yeah, I was gonna say, I really, really want to do Dogs in the Vineyard as a sort of <i>Gunslinger</i>/Stephen King's <i>Dark Tower</i> thing.  Lends itself so well...  The phrase "Knights of the Cross with six-shooters" keeps traipsing through my head.                        </div>
