One of the things that called my attention was that in the descriptions of the game, the concept of "story" were greatly highlighted, and in conversations with members of PCI (mostly Eric), it had been made very clear that WH had been designed from the start to be a game of cinematic action where story was given primary importance. Neat!<br/><br/>So I got the book and I skimmed over it, especially over the background section and the core rules, just to get an idea of what the game was about and how the rules worked. I went over the chargen section as well, but only lightly. When I was done, I remember I felt a bit dissapointed: for a game that touted story as its most important aspect, I did not find any rules mechanic that supported it. I'd been tainted by the story games concept and community, so I wanted to see some of that mentality and design in there. But alas, I didn't. I put the book aside to read later and moved on.<br/><br/>Lately I'd been having the urge to run this game, so as part of my 2008 gamer resolutions, I decided to run a play-by-email game of WH. I immediately started reading the book cover-to-cover in preparation, and would you guess what I come to find within its pages?<br/><br/>WH actually does have quite a few elements of story gaming in its rules and I had totally missed them because they are perfectly enmeshed in the rules of the game. For example:\n<ol>\n<li>WH comes with a built-in bang/kicker: you had this Catalyst, some sort of event (usually traumatic) by which you became aware of the Invisible (Spirit) World and the machinations of the Adversary, and it is because of this that you now are a Witch Hunter. The game offers Orders that function kinda like Clans in Vampire in the sense that they give you a place to belong and a way to further define your character, giving you also some more kickers in the process as you define how your character matches the tenets of that Order.<br/></li><li>Virtue and Vice/Sin - more kicker goodness, and these can be "compelled" kind of like in FATE in that the GM can call a player out to live up to her Virtue and/or Sin, even (and especially) to the detriment of the character, but always to the betterment of the story. This can earn you Hero Points (see below). And get this, giving in to your Sin actually brings mechanical benefits, tempting you all the time.<br/></li><li>Some Talents (think Feats) give players the ability to define the world as they play (the biggest example is the Contacts talent, with which you can define who your contact is during play). There is room for growth here, but it is a good step.<br/></li><li>Hero Points - a kind of Fate Point, HP allow you to do a few story gamey things like gaining one by playing a Virtue to the character's detriment, by doing things that "drastically enhances the enjoyment of the Scene" (Fan Mail), or by adding a welcome complication to the plot by making a declaration; or you can spend one to negate a Vice/Sin compel, as well as to enjoy more mechanical benefits like an extra die or automatic stabilization when having suffered lots of damage.<br/></li></ol>\nSo what do you know, there is stuff in there in the realm of story gaming!<br/><br/>The game sits squarely in the void between traditional and hippie games because, simplified as it is, there are still a number of rules to keep track of if you so choose, and task resolution is still king of the field. I would have liked to see more simplification of some of the crunchier parts of the book, ideally, though I like what I got.<br/><br/>I know I will be introducing a couple more story gamey elements to my game, such as Beliefs from Burning Wheel (IMO, a must for a game where the character's religion is as important, if not more, as her name) and Conflict Resolution/Bringing Down the Pain from TSoY (especially because we're playing by email and I don't want to get into too many silly combats).<br/><br/>So check Witch Hunter out: it hides its story gaminess within its pages.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117940/#Comment_117940" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-04T09:24:37+00:00" title="January  4, 2008  9:24AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.

Yes? No? Why?</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=401614" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Witch Hunter: Invisible World - my impressions</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=405776" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Witch Hunter: What character are you playing</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=405860" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Savage World of Salomon Kane vs. Witch Hunter ... which one?</a></li>\n</ul>\nFrom speaking to a couple of people who have both, it seems the preference tends to get down to system and/or love of the SK stories. I have not read Howard's SK stories, and never played Savage Worlds, so when I went through the book my impression was of a cool setting that was a bit too tied down to the source fiction (you don't play SK, but every character is tied to SK somehow). <br/><br/>What appeals to me about WH is the mix of swashbuckle and horror, and the pseudo-historical setting. The game is set in the late 17th century, in a world where New Netherlands is still thriving, the Aztecs beat back the Spanish, and the nasties of legends are very much real. I like that the core book focuses on North America, but includes a gazetteer of the rest of the world (and new books and adventures are starting to explore other areas already). I like that the setting is not tied to an external source, and that while it is rich with its own history, I can very much pick and choose what elements I bring in (which, to be fair, you can do with any game, but those with an external source, like a novel, tend to elicit stronger feelings of sticking to canon).<br/><br/>As I mention above, I also like the (transitional) mix of traditional and story-oriented rules. In my game I have been leaning a lot on those story-oriented rules (Hero Points, compeling Virtues and Vices) and the players have started to respond in kind, playing their their bangs, playing their Virtues/Vices, using Hero Points to grab narrative control at times.<br/><br/>By all means, ask any questions you may have and I'll be happy to answer. And if you wanna give it a try at GC, we'll see if we can do something. I'm rusty as a GM (been doing it by email for a while now, but haven't had much face-to-face practice lately), but I'll do my best to run a fun session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161367/#Comment_161367" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T05:54:36+00:00" title="August  8, 2008  5:54AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I totally forgot to check back to this thread those months ago after asking you about it.

Was it Swans, by any chance?<br/></br></blockquote>\nI'll definitely be hanging and easy to rope into play!<br><br>I forget the scenario's name, but it involved a house getting burned down and some missing children.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161448/#Comment_161448" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T10:20:28+00:00" title="August  8, 2008 10:20AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Phil: I have the Media Meet-n-Greet from 7-9 pm, and after that I'm good.

For someone like me, who games with mostly trad-style gamers and who is still slowly getting into the story game frame of mind, it works out as a great gateway.<br/><br/>@ Rob: I'll be sure to look you up, then, so we can get a game together with Phil. And thanks for the scenario info (that's a different one, not Swans, which I think does a pretty good job of working as an intro to the world and themes of WH).<br/><br/>Andy, you in?  ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161473/#Comment_161473" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T11:49:39+00:00" title="August  8, 2008 11:49AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To anyone who's played or read this game: have you seen anything about it that would make 1 player / 1 GM play particularly difficult?

Just scale down the nature of what the Witch Hunter is investigating and be done. I'd put a bit more emphasis on NPCs to help round out the PC as well, but a solo WH should be no big deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philreed" title="philreed"><img alt="philreed" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philreed">philreed</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161536/#Comment_161536" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T15:37:19+00:00" title="August  8, 2008  3:37PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2008 3:37PM by philreed.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: Daniel M.
