Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BqeLkgeusM" rel="nofollow">youtube video</a> shows there unique nature.<br/>Another good theme with the game is <b>taking the Average</b> tells you which actions are too easy to bother rolling for. You never have to slow down the action.<br/>Also because the dice are Zero's and ones 50/50,, you can work out your average dice success roll by dividing total dice rolled by two, <br/>So 6 die should roll a result of 3 successes on average.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RedwoodR" title="RedwoodR"><img alt="RedwoodR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RedwoodR">RedwoodR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417678/#Comment_417678" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-02T15:36:27+00:00" title="July  2, 2013  3:36PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've thought about getting HEX for a while - now I may have to just for this supplement!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food" title="Will_GM_for_Food"><img alt="Will_GM_for_Food" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food">Will_GM_for_Food</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417759/#Comment_417759" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-04T07:10:36+00:00" title="July  4, 2013  7:10AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been running HEX for three or four years now at conventions. The system has some definite advantages. Chief among them, it's extremely easy to teach and stays largely in the background. There are a very small number of quirks that I'm not a fan of, but most of them involve the rules for character creation. I provide characters for my convention games, so my players are insulated from those quirks.<br/><br/>The other really big advantage of the system -- and this isn't really mentioned in any of the rule books -- is that the grittiness of the system is adjustable. The system is billed as a pulp engine, but intrinsically, it's really not. The thing that makes it pulpy is the Style Points that the GM awards to players for doing neat stuff. If the GM is generous with Style Points, the players can spend them to have their characters do all sorts of larger-than-life things. But if the GM is less liberal with Style Points, the game can become downright gritty. <br/><br/>The first adventure I ran with the Ubiquity system was a nonpulp, post-apocalyptic scenario. (I had designed the scenario first, and then afterward selected the game system I'd use to run it. Not exactly the textbook way of doing things.) The system supported that theme very well, because I kept the Style Points in relatively short supply. The HEX adventure I'm running this year, on the other hand, is intended to be way over the top. The system supports that style of play equally well, as long as I remember to award Style Points frequently.<br/><br/>So you have a flexible system that doesn't have a lot of crunch and that stays in the background. Good stuff. Just be sure to get all your players on the same page by letting them know where you want your adventure to fall on the scale from gritty to high action.<br/><br/>The Hollow Earth <i>setting</i>, on the other hand, is pure pulp and is just freakin' cool. You'll find all of Exile Studios' settings to be wonderfully evocative. Perfect for heart-pounding action and over-the-top stunts.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417793/#Comment_417793" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T05:34:54+00:00" title="July  5, 2013  5:34AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Redwood I'm wondering which Pledge to bid on, <br/><br/>The Warlord pledge cost for Hardcover plus Pdf and shipping is 70 dollars or \xa347 pounds. <br/>The Rocket scientist pledge for Hardcover plus Pdf and 4 other supplement Pdf's and shipping  90 dollars or \xa373.<br/><br/>Seems lots of dosh but I like the setting!<br/><br/>Hi Will your right about the grittiness it does seem easy to get killed, but your solution with the style points is the answer, I will mention this to the players in the next game and dish out a few more style points.<br/><br/>I find non lethal damage a bit confusing wondering if you could help?<br/>The points I got are...... when does nonlethal become lethal damage, and can you be knocked unconscious if you take more nonlethal then your stun?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
