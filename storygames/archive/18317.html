I'm pretty sure its missing something to differentiate it from a hardholder and a solace more clearly, so if you have ideas/feedback, please fire away!    The text underneath the name is more descriptive than evocative at the moment.  Alternate title was "The Noble" or "The Duchess."  I'm sort of picturing a fallen lord of a crumbling castle taken over by a hardholder's force because of its strategic value, or a noble farmer who's property has been invaded by a gang and she's doing the best she can to keep it running and maintain her place in the chaos.<br/><br/><b>The Blueblood</b><br/>You\u2019re not in charge, probably, but you\u2019ve got something they want.  A mansion or a farm, the deed to a lab full of hi-tech parts, maybe in your basement there\u2019s a gaping hole where the psychic maelstrom comes pouring out.  And you know how to leverage promises and obligations in order to keep yourself safe.<br/><br/>TITLE &amp; NAME<br/>Duchess, Baron, Marquess, Count, Tsarina, Sir, Dame, Oba, Vizier, Sultana, Emir, Maharani<br/>Justine, Alexander, George, William, Kate, Diana, Victor, Oduduwa, Bilqis, Amir, Taj<br/><br/>STATS<br/><br/>Cool -1, Hard 1, Hot 1, Sharp 2, Weird 0<br/>Cool 1, Hard 1, Hot 0, Sharp 2, Weird -1<br/>Cool 1, Hard 0, Hot 1, Sharp 2, Weird -1<br/>Cool 0, Hard -1, Hot 1, Sharp 2, Weird 1<br/><br/>HX<br/><br/>Who seems like the real authority around here?

Probably because I tried to leave the "domain" open instead of isolating a particular sort of holding that would make sense.   It might make more sense as a compendium playbook of sorts.  Was a fun half-exercise though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413126/#Comment_413126" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T17:07:17+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  5:07PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like the core of the character concept is someone who trades on their reputation, yeah? People treat them differently, like maybe they are a remnant of the Golden Age themselves. Maybe like the Touchstone is a symbol of hope and a better tomorrow, this character is a symbol of sadness for a yesterday lost. Which makes it hard for people to treat them like a normal person. It could work as a supplement or expansion for the Hardholder, Hocus, and Maestro D' pretty well, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
