It will shake off the crust and accumulated detritus adopt or adapt some of the more promising ideas proposed by the indie scene and reimagine itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that point, the indie scene is no longer needed and no longer really in a position to compete effectively with the scale and resources of the establishment.  Then the scene dwindles to a handful of the hardest of the hard core practicing their craft on the fringes until the next time there is a need for the scene to blossum again.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236583/#Comment_236583" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T09:18:34+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  9:18AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2009 9:23AM by Graham.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could consider indie gaming like fringe theatre.<br><br>Fringe theatre challenges the establishment.

I think you're right that the scene is far fragmented and less vibrant than it was. EDITED TO ADD: This isn't really an awful, awful thing. It's just a thing.

I really just don't know whether it's true or not here, but it makes sense. Regardless, I think that the indie scene has seen its "bleeding edge" phase. Now, it's on to a steeper part of the bell curve of adopters. And, thus far, it's been largely too steep to succeed very well. Too few people are taking the genuinely valuable ideas that come from creator-owned RPGs in 2002-2006 (or whenever), and recasting those things into products with wider appeal to gamers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236618/#Comment_236618" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T10:50:59+00:00" title="October  9, 2009 10:50AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i gotta say, it doesn't really concern me to have wider commercial appeal, the oft-story-gamer-touted "mass audience". this is an underground-on-purpose part of the hobby, to me; while there's nothing wrong with pursuing that, it's not why i'm in this.<br/><br/>if i'd discovered Sorcerer in '93, instead of AD&amp;D, things would have been way better for me and my group. i don't like mainstream games; as much as i enjoyed the vampire splat books as a teenager, i didn't really care for the rules. i merely disliked them somewhat less than those of d&amp;d. it's like i went on a downward curve of dislike from ad&amp;d - white wolf - d&amp;d, and it took the Forge to show me games i actually like, like donjon and otherkind.<br/><br/>/bitter                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236620/#Comment_236620" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T10:57:10+00:00" title="October  9, 2009 10:57AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt:<br/><br/>You're right that there are few people, but they are doing it. If you look at the more popular games that came out last year (Mouse Guard, D&amp;D 4), and some of the games in development (Apocalypse World, Blowback, I'm sure there are more) It's like everything old is new again. For some people there's a definite trend towards more traditionally-styled games that are informed by the things that have happened in the indie scene. There will always be people out on the edge, tilling new soil, but there will always be people bringing the harvest back, too. Fragmentation is an inevitability, and like you say, it's not bad. There's also been a long tradition of everyone working off of the same practices, the same ideas, and for a while (when I first got involved with indie games) it felt like all of the games just felt the same as a result.<br/><br/>I'm thinking/hoping that the fragmentation will lead to more original thoughts and ideas, more people exploring what makes games fun for <i>them,</i> and less trying to fit what they're doing into a model of what they think games should be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236622/#Comment_236622" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T11:00:36+00:00" title="October  9, 2009 11:00AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could see more movements reacting against RPGs focused on tactical and computer game like play. We can\u2019t compete with computers, so let\u2019s focus on what\u2019s different about the medium.  D&amp;D; 4E is cool in many ways. But there is a lot there to rally against. I\u2019ve been talking to more and more people who have stopped playing and went back to WoW or DDO. Similar feel. Less work. Note, D&amp;D; 4E doesn\u2019t have to be this way. See DMG 1 &amp; 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could see movements to push delivery of RPG play through social networks and mobile apps. Evolving play by post communities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also could see movements to rally against RPG as product. Maybe RPG as open source living documents. But there is so much choice, I would find it very hard to focus on one system to contribute to. And just releasing RPG for free doesn\u2019t inspire community.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese exist in one form or another. But I think you are right, there is so much existing choice and the establishment while not completely shocked out of its complacency is much more so than it was, there is much less to rally against.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pathfinder / piazo community of freelance designers and writers is strong. They have their own private community of 30+ collaborators who constantly exchange ideas and help each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have more people designing in public. Rob, Joshua, John, and Ed for example. RPG Podcasts feel like a strong new movement. And many RPG podcasters help and support each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt feels like there is less forum collaboration online as compared to the forge circa 2004-2006. Forums in general (although I love them) feel less vibrant. Facebook and Twitter have been very helpful. Maybe there are less teachers, more students, and more leaches. Or networks are more distributed. The push towards blogs without having an aggregator in place to link them all was problematic.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we are just lacking the next Ron Edwards. It's a high cost, low reward position.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel some of the offline communities are thriving. NYC\u2019s Gotham Gaming Guild has been an absolute blast and I\u2019m having huge success playtesting there. We\u2019re on our 10th season and we\u2019ve grown this season after 2 less active seasons.

And, for other goals, the concentrated scene has advantages. I'm glad you enjoy the non-Forge-centric stuff going on. Great! <br><br/>Overall, whether Forge related or not, I'm less enthusiastic about games, generally, than I was about games from 2002-2006 or so. I'm a big fan of Gregor Hutton's 3:16. I think it's one of the best, and most successful games released in recent years. It's equal or greater than any good game you'd choose from 2002-2006. It's just that I could chose, oh, 5-6 games from that era, wheras I'm only seeing about 1-2 equally impressive games since.<br/><br/>Is that a personal preference thing for you and me? I really don't know. Maybe. Does it have anythign to do with concentration vs. fragmentation? Again, I don't know for sure. But, yeah, I have come down on the side of "well, the fragmentation hasn't been as good so far." \n<blockquote>I would bet a paycheck that more people are playing creator-owned designs in 2009 than played creator-owned designs in 2006. Indie gaming has an audience, and that's fucking awesome.</blockquote>\nI agree that there are almost certainly more people playing creator-owned games. It's great. It's just not great <i>enough</i>, in my view.<br/><br/>What is the size of that audience? We agree it's bigger. Why is it bigger? (I really don't know for sure; I'm not trying to be a jerk.) Is it bigger because it's significantly bigger, proportionately, than in 2006 or because there are just more games out there? It is adding or multiplying? If it's multiplying, is it <i>enough</i>? Upon what do we base such conclusions? Is it convention attendance? Sales? IPR's "Top Sales" lists? Forum traffic? Etc.<br/><br/>I'm looking at whatever information I can find about how many games an indie publisher can sell. There are a small number of games that have sold 2,000 total in their entire lifetime (i.e. since, oh, 2001 let's say). There are an EXTREMELY small number of games that sold over 2,000 in 2 years. There are no indie scene games at all that sold 2,000 in 1 year.<br/>\n<blockquote>And if a scene dies, fragments, or transforms unrecognizably, that's not a bad thing.</blockquote>\nI agree. I'm pretty sure that's what I said when I started posting, and what Ralph said when he posted.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236682/#Comment_236682" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T14:09:51+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  2:09PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2009 2:10PM by johnzo.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Not following your assertion John.</blockquote>\nI'm not asserting anything.

That seems kinda uh, tautological.  I thought you must be getting at *something* else there, but if that's the sum of what you're saying then uh, yeah.<br/><br/>* The reaction against the Comics Code Authority stabilized into an entire alternative movement, and while that movement cross-pollinates with the big-money mainstream all the time, it remains defiantly distinct from it.  The indie comics creator experience is completely different than the mainstream comics creator experience.   New creators and audience constantly regenerate the movement.  There is no sign of dwindling there.  Indie tabletop gaming feels much the same.  Some publishers might have folded, some creators might have drifted away, but the movement they helped create carries on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236684/#Comment_236684" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T14:11:19+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  2:11PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, it's really fun being a 27yo curmudgeon about the "old days" of 2004.<br/><br/>I think a big part of the perceived stagnation of indie games is that new games are less often boldly cutting out a new swatch of design territory, but instead colonizing bits of relatively familiar ground in between landmarks established by previous games.  I mean, the two most recent design trends that have made some noise are the "American Jeepform" adopters -- which, as with Everway and HeroQuest and what have you, are incorperating other folks' ideas into the scene -- and some recent forays into solo play (Sweet Agatha, How to Host a Dungeon, The Smoke Dream).<br/><br/>Otherwise, yeah, this particular indie game scene has generally stopped being at the bleeding edge.  Warhammer Fantasy III looks to be more progressive than many recent indie games, in some ways, in the sense that's it's pushing a new publication format and reaching for a different audience.  I've hopefully that some efforts by folks from this scene -- such as the foray into anime conventions and some messing around with publishing strategies -- may still end up creating some cool stuff, but I think a lot of us are waiting for the next big thing to happen instead of being a part of making it happen this time around.  And that's totally cool.

I just can't distinguish, because I can't step out of my own shoes and observe from far away (I mean, I can try, but I can't really be wholly successful.)<br/><br/>I don't think I'm alone in this. I think it's true for everyone in the entire world. Just part of the act of perception.<br/><br/>You, Jonathan, and Ralph really seem to me to be going through this, right now. I look around and go "Uh, no, there's a huge amount of energy and enthusiasm going on right now." But instead of going "you're wrong!" and trying to argue on points, which would be pointless (because it's not going to change your perception unless it also changes your own play and publishing. which it won't.) I'm instead saying "we're all prisoners of our own perceptions on this.

Everything is spreading out and mixing.  Some elements may break off entirely and form their own separate sub-hobby.

So I think it's fair to ask 'is this dissatisfaction a sign of overall decay and decline, or is it something peculiar to these guys?'<br/><br/>As for me, I am positive about this community because since 2006 I have met dozens of players with serious funmaking skills -- skills of a magnitude I could not have even imagined in the 1990s.  My positivity is much less about game design; it's about the quality of people this community continues to attract.

It doesn't surprise me that you're burnt out on "the scene," because you're burnt out on design. If, tomorrow, you were to be hit with a massive and beautiful inspiration, and you were so motivated by it that you sought out a great group of folks to regularly playtest and develop it with, I would bet you would look at the brilliant new stuff that's coming out (Random selection: S/lay w/Me, Mist Robed Gate, Ribbon Drive, Dance and the Dawn, 3:16) with joy and enthusiasm, rather than dejected resentment.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm working on a ton of shit. I have a new book at the printers, which includes the best game I have ever written, by far. I have some crazy shit going on with Bliss Stage, including a video game adaptation. I'm working on my own massive and beautiful inspiration (called Clover) and I have some other projects which are just as exciting but I can't talk about them yet. So I go "Holy shit! S/lay w/Me is awesome! I'm gonna play this all the damn time" and I do.

It also won the Diana Jones Award. <br/><br/>These two facts sit so strangely in my head, I don't know how to even talk about it. 300?!?!? Three FUCKING HUNDRED? Really, that's all? <br/><br/>That's just really, deeply disappointing <i>to me</i>. I don't know what Jason thinks about it. It's his game, his goal, and his prerogative. And, I love him for it, and love his game. It's fantastic. I'm not trying to insult him and his success levels.<br/><br/>But, suppose I also wanted to create a historically relevant, narrativist WWII game (I did, in fact, want to do this)? Can and should I expect to sell only about 300? Well, if so, that's a nonstarter. That's not sufficient for me. I would define my own success in such a way that 300 sold would be a serious failure on my terms.<br/><br/>So, what's wrong? Why did Grey Ranks only get 300 sales? Here are a couple plausible answers: <br/><br/>1) Jason didn't especially care to get more than 300 sales. It's his call, after all. He said, yep, 300's good enough for me, and that's ok.<br/><br/>2) The game is not meeting the demand of gamers. That is, it's just not appealing to enough people. It is what it is, and that's all. Maybe the unavoidable fact is that reaching more than 300 sales is either way to much fucking work to be worth it just not possible at all.<br/><br/>3) Jason and Co. didn't sufficiently market Grey Ranks. Maybe they could have reached 1,000 over that same period of time, but their marketing wasn't terribly effective. (Similarly, maybe they wanted to, but didn't have the time/money to do it, which is understandable.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So, what I perceive with this, my own experiences, and the information I'm able to glean across the board is a couple things: <br/><br/>1) Our community, to its credit, praises publishers for their creative efforts and genius. It deeply respects creators. However, our community does not challenge publishers to raise the bar in terms of success. Fred Hicks, for example, has received a good deal of positive praise for his marketing skills. Relatively few others have received such praise.<br/>2) Creators in our community are almost exclusively fixed upon the acts design, creation (i.e. publication), and play. These are WONDERFUL values. I'm not nay-saying them. However, I am saying that, broadly speaking, creators (and, hence, publishers) are not fixed upon specific success metrics, marketing successes, and growth. Now, this isn't <i>required</i> of anyone at all. But, I sure would like to see some folks rise above current sales levels because it would be the best measure of the growth of this activity.<br/><br/>3) Again, broadly speaking, publishers talk about and praise extremely difficult goals, like "reaching non gamers" to sell their games, in large part because they recognize that "trad" gamers aren't their target. Well, it's a damn sight easier to market to trad gamers than it is non gamers. And, yet, relatively few people praise this activity. In fact, I think it's fair to say we generally turn away from it. Why not instead embrace those people and create games for them? (After all, we were "once" them!) Games they really, truly want. Not games that they find and say things like "Oh, this is neat and all, but I'll never get my group to play it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236710/#Comment_236710" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T15:22:20+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  3:22PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also a bit dumbfounded by the idea that there needs to be 10000 people buying/playing "The New Sorcerer". What I see now as compared to 5 years ago is that there are more small games out there than any sane person could even hope to play. And many of them are fascinating. Maybe it's rough that they're not finding their audience as readily, but if you ask me what's better for the hobby in general - and what comes closer to the aspirations of the earlier days of the movement - it's not to do 2005, but bigger. Not to have the Big, Revolutionary Game that everybody is suddenly talking about and playing that transforms the hobby. We're evolutionary, not revolutionary now. That's GREAT.<br/><br/>It's what I see around me - 10000 people playing 500 games that didn't exist before. Each one small, niche, unique. I guess I don't see the splintering of the "scene" into a whole lot of marginally interpenetrating mini-scenes as in any way undesirable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236717/#Comment_236717" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T15:48:02+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  3:48PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt Snyder, you seem to have a highly inflated sense of the hobby's worth.

Look at your lament about Grey Ranks not selling more than 300 copies.  (I agree with you that's a travesty.)<br/><br/>Now look at your lament about people trying to market to non-gamers rather than trad gamers.<br/><br/>To me, those two observations seem to imply somewhat contradictory goals.  Making truly groundbreaking art is necessarily going to require the production of games\u2014GR, SAJ, Penny, other things like that\u2014that simply aren't going to appeal to mainstream gamers.  Yeah, maybe most of us once were them, but speaking strictly for myself here, I'm really truly not anymore.  (And Jason's even less so than me.)  So it's hardly surprising that not everyone is catering to the aesthetic sensibilities of more traddy gaming groups.<br/><br/>And, I mean, there are plenty of indie games, including more recent ones, that do have at least some crossover appeal.  All the Burning stuff, 3:16, L&amp;L, How to Host A Dungeon, all come to mind.  But games whose fictional content and/or play structure are so highly non-traditional that most D&amp;D, WW, or GURPS players say, "Eh, not for me," to those games is absolutely inherently necessary to this scene being about what it's about.<br/><br/>Also, I've heard some anecdotal evidence (at the indie designer roundtable at DexCon this summer) that targeted, niche marketing to non-gamers can be successful, that Joshua has marketed Shock: at SF non-gaming cons, that Julia has marketed SAJ at historically black colleges, etc.<br/><br/>I'm certainly planning on showing GR to the history teachers at the high school where I work at some point.  Not with the goal of turning them into gamers, but perhaps I can turn them into "people who own a copy of GR."  :-)<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236771/#Comment_236771" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T06:36:21+00:00" title="October 10, 2009  6:36AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Making truly groundbreaking art is necessarily going to require the production of games\u2014GR, SAJ, Penny, other things like that\u2014that simply aren't going to appeal to mainstream gamers. <br/><br/>But games whose fictional content and/or play structure are so highly non-traditional that most D&amp;D, WW, or GURPS players say, "Eh, not for me," to those games is absolutely inherently necessary to this scene being about what it's about.</blockquote>\nThese are two key assumptions I wish to confront in the post I'm working on.

Otherwise there'd be no real reason for it to be indie -- if the mainstream liked it, the artist could "sell out," join the mainstream, and get more of an audience every time, meaning only the cranks who value their "indie cred" over successfully reaching people would be left in the scene.  (Which I think might be the last stage in the indie scene life cycle described in Valamir's original post.)<br/><br/>I agree that it's a terrible way to define creator-owned RPG publishing, though.  Even if it turns out to be accurate, it's still terrible and there ought to be a better way to define it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236778/#Comment_236778" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T08:58:49+00:00" title="October 10, 2009  8:58AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2009 9:21AM by JDCorley.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is never a "need" for a scene of any kind, indie or not, ever, forever, the end.

But I can think of a number of things that are very, very commonly a part of games in the "scene" as it currently exists - and things that are active draws for a lot of us who play these games - that are actively distasteful to Joe Average Gamer.\n<ul>\n<li>Redistribution of table authority away from the usual GM/player split</li>\n<li>subject matter that is not some variety of heroic, escapist genre fiction</li>\n<li>engagement with real-world issues of race, class, gender, etc. in ways that do not easily permit ironic distancing</li>\n<li>baked-in tight focus of subject matter</li>\n<li>exclusively short-run or one-shot play</li>\n<li>breaking the 4th wall as an essential assumption of play, a.k.a. "metagaming"</li>\n</ul>\nI could go on.<br/><br/>Now, the "mainstream" is getting very fragmented itself - thank at least in part to the influence of the earlier waves of "indie" innovation. You can see that in the reaction to games like <i>Spirit of the Century</i>, and the new editions of <i>Warhammer Fantasy</i> and <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>. Some people embrace them. But an awful lot of people - the core of the mainstream - are really, resistant. It's only the massive mindshare and brand identity that WHFRP and D&amp;D have that have allowed them to start mainstreaming "indie crap." Parallel to this, the internet and indie-style ultra-cheap production has made the exploitation of super-niche tastes a viable spot for the hobby press, but no major RPG hobby business play has yet turned much of a profit on these folks. Mostly, they go off into the thousand micro-scenes, each clustered around the particular obsessions of a few hundred gamers.<br/><br/>But the "mainstream" is very, very conservative. Practically by definition. We are not going to come up with some brilliant new way to market to them. They will age out, wear out, and slowly lose their hegemony over the hobby, but NOBODY is going to be the "next Wizards".

I intend to do do that, though what I have in mind is probably very difficult to succeed with, and may even just be not workable. Meanwhile, I'd prefer to see my peers and friends read me (and, oddly, my emotinal well being) a bit more charitably and stop with the dog piling to get me to hush up already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236798/#Comment_236798" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T14:03:23+00:00" title="October 10, 2009  2:03PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi-Who-Babbles.</cite><br/>The end state could be one where "Let me tell you about my game!" takes on the ring of "Let me tell you about my character!" - occasionally awesome, but usually noxious, because there's almost as many games as groups, everyone has one they're building, nobody wants to hear about yours, and the culture actually comes to grips with that.</blockquote>\nI wish.<br/><br/>That's where I'd <b>like</b> to see the end state be, because that's healthy, sustainable, and diverse.

People flee those conversational groups for others and attempt new conversational groups that re-spin that noise into a different signal, or exclude it deliberately.  They accumulate failures and successes (mostly failures, of course), and the old groups get adjourned or reconstructed (socially speaking) as part of a broad trend once the pattern of the successes is obvious.  And mostly, people don't realise that this is happening, even as they do it.<br/><br/>The light control version already exists on RPGnet - it goes "It's rude to talk about your own game unless you're doing it in a thread that's <i>for</i> that kind of thing.  If it's obviously a good place to mention your thing in some other thread, apologise for the self-pimping". It's not a rule, and not a sweeping norm, but it's gaining traction slowly.<br/><br/>It's not what I'd call a tidy deal, but this kind of process is happening pretty much <i>all the time.</i> <br/><br/>Now, getting a lot more real, that's not likely to happen to the mainstream of gaming - there <b>will</b> be a tall head of games that gets a lot of individual attention, games discussed as games.  But it might very well happen way out here in the long tail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236811/#Comment_236811" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T15:55:39+00:00" title="October 10, 2009  3:55PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A while back, I took the position that no story games player or creator has the obligation to evangelize, unless they promised that they would as part of some kind of larger arrangement (e.g. Luke, as a full-timer, has people to pay). But I am seeing a way in which maybe I've impaled myself on a fork.<br/><br/>The thing that pisses me off most about these games, and the way we talk about them, isn't the elitism, the insularity, the echo-chamber fora, or any of that BS. What pisses me off is that I didn't find out about InSpectres, which came out in 2002, until 2009. I wasted seven years of opportunities to run a supernatural mystery game where I, the GM, didn't have to know the Answer in advance, where I could be as surprised as everyone else. No one told me I could have been having more fun. There was no master I could go to with my woes, who would tell me that "System Matters!" and bam! enlighten me.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that I was a reasonably well-informed gamer. I was aware of the existence of games from small publishers; I had a complete set of the New Style games acquired as they were published. But I never found out about My Life With Master, a game that would have been perfect for me and the people I played with. I played D&amp;D with a DM who, in retrospect, I can see would have loved to run a real monster. There is no way I can see, in that same retrospect, how I would have found out that the perfect medium (MLWM) existed.<br/><br/>So having figured out what I need to do to have fun every time, maybe, annoyingly, I do have a sort of bodhisattva-esque responsibility to convey salvific knowledge to people who could be having transcendent kinds of fun, on the grounds that if no one does, then everywhere GMs are condemned to ride the Wheel of Prep Samsara eternally, and players to suffer from creative frustration. If I act on a rule where I do nothing, then universalizing it, everyone winds up in the position I was in, which is an unendorsable result. <br/><br/>When is this particular indie scenes necessary? Until all beings are enlightened, I guess. Until every group knows that there might be a solution to their dissatisfaction with their current palette of games. Until the understanding that System Matters (and <i>only</i> matters) penetrates into every table. Until every gamer's repertoire of technique is stocked with the tools that he can use to build the stories he wants to tell and hear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Musings] When are indie scenes necessary? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10668/musings-when-are-indie-scenes-necessary/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[Musings] When are indie scenes necessary? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10668/musings-when-are-indie-scenes-necessary/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Are indie games defined solely by the fact that certain aspects of the games won't appeal to trad gamers?

games won't appeal to trad gamers?  No.  3:16 is just as much of an indie game as SAJ, after all.  But I think that Trait--Unappealing to Trad Gamers 4d10--is pretty essential to the "scene"'s definition.  Not that designers are going out of their way to be unappealing to trad gamers, mind you!  (That *would* be super elitist and stupid.)  But simply because people are writing the kinds of games they want to play.  <br/><br/>Look at L&amp;L for an interesting example.  It's this weird hybrid of uber-traditional dungeoncrawl and uber-modern shared narrative.  It might actually be a good bridge game for grognards\u2014but maybe not.  I mean, it requires that everyone rotate GM responsibilities!<br/><br/>Indie designers are pretty much going to continue designing whatever the fuck they want\u2014*that's* the essential element of the scene.  Sometimes maybe there will be a breakout hit with a lot of crossover appeal, like MouseGuard and 3:16 and Panty Explosion and whatnot.  But I don't think it's something we can deliberately aim for with our design processes\u2014think of it as the Fruitful Void of the Designing RPGs RPG.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236855/#Comment_236855" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T05:44:29+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  5:44AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2009 5:49AM by Clinton.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite><br/> Meanwhile, I'd prefer to see my peers and friends read me (and, oddly, my emotinal well being) a bit more charitably and stop with the dog piling to get me to hush up already.</blockquote>\nIt's not dog-piling when you're wrong and presumptuous and everyone points out, "Hey, Matt, you're both wrong and presumptuous."

Three FUCKING HUNDRED?

As I pointed out initially- you're not giving criticism as a player/consumer, you're not giving information as a publisher, AND you're making demands, which, as far as anyone can tell, might not even be feasible.  ("I would like SOMEONE to develop a teleporter... Oh WON'T SOMEONE develop a teleporter.  Clearly the fields of science aren't PUSHING THEMSELVES hard enough.  Why are your standards SO LOW?" etc.)<br/><br/>Trust me, I'd love to see thousands of copies of games being sold, and an increase in play networks.  But if you don't have anything actual in terms of insights of steps to take differently, you're just...  what? What are you doing?  How is anyone supposed to respond to that?<br/><br/>ETA: You're telling us how we're all doing it wrong.

Chris and others are complaining that routinely I swoop in, complain about the state of the indie RPG publishing scene, and then not actually do anything. That criticism <i>from a person who also has done nothing in terms of publishing</i> seems out of line to me.<br/><br/>I can understand that to a great degree. I have many times in the past voiced criticisms. I sure I've been wrong at times. And, I'm also sure I've criticized things that I never did anything about in terms of leading by example. <br/><br/>But, I have a record of cricizing things, then <i>doing something</i> about those very things I'm criticizing. I devoted over 2 years to the Ashcan Front for exactly that. It took my time, my money, and Paul and I took a not-insignificant amount of flack all the while for doing it.<br/><br/>In this situation, yet again, I'm being called out for being a big ol' meany who's stiring things up without action. When, in fact, I'm taking action (among the least of which is daring to have a discussion about things -- the horror!). I'm really tired of reactions that amount to "Matt, you're being a big meany again. Can't you see that you don't do anything, are just hurt inside, and should just hush up?"<br/><br/>No, I actually don't see it that way. If that's confirmation for you that, yep, Matt's gone off the deep end, more power to you. Clearly, we're not the pals we pretend to be.<br/><br/>I really think I have shown I'm doing more than that over the years, and I find it very frustrating that within the span of fewer than 2 weeks people have assumed some of the following: Matt is doing nothing; Matt is burned out on design; Matt is "hurting"; etc. These are insulting, ignorant perceptions of me, my work behind the scenes, and my mental health. I've actually said "Hey, let's talk about this instead of assume silly things about me" and it continues. <br/><br/>And, now, of course! I'm the bad guy.

That is just not there. I thought I went out of my way to make that very point, but it must not be coming across. If so, I'll say it again: I absolutely, definitely do not think that other creator-owned publishers success metrics should be set by anyone but the creator-owner.<br/><br/>But, you're right that this thread isn't helping anyone, least of all me, and it's way off the path Ralph initially set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236925/#Comment_236925" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T15:06:30+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  3:06PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Matt,<br/><br/>Go do more of what you're doing in that other thread.<br/><br/>You'd be really surprised to read the last 5 years of what I've had to say about these "people I'm defending".<br/><br/>Amusing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10668/musings-when-are-indie-scenes-necessary" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10668/musings-when-are-indie-scenes-necessary" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10668/musings-when-are-indie-scenes-necessary/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F10668%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F10668%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
