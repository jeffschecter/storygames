It piqued my interest and I liked it in actual play and I feel that this game has a lot of potential for my groups but I need to clarify a lot of points in the rules:<br/><br/>- Who's turn is it\u2014who says who's set is on? We cannot really base this on some kind of in-fiction logic, because then Marmot could choose one or two much more likely suspects and go interrogate them all the time. Or can we?<br/>- What is the cast of a scene apart from Marmot (he has to be in to be able to roll)? The suspect of the set and possibly minor characters played by players of the other suspects? Can you play a scene without any suspects? Can you play a scene with more than one suspect in it?<br/>- Can you introduce new sets?<br/>- Can a suspect die?<br/>- Who decides to roll / who activates Marmot's dice / \u201cmoves\u201d? I run Dungeon World and we every time have this sometimes really imperceptible negotiation before deciding to use dice or not: more often it's me, but sometimes the PC players are the ones who initiate this \u201cthat's a roll, yeah?\u201d negotiation. On the other hand, Marmot's rolls are only described on that single sheet. (And even there a bit scarcely for my taste: what is _not_<br/>following a clue? Why would you hibernate during solving a case?) E. g. how can its player activate a move like (i)\u201csuffer violence\u201d and (ii)\u201csee through a lie\u201d\u2014(i)I think the other players are the ones who can use violence and rarely is in Marmot's best interest to just harm himself w/o the mediation of a violent suspect. (ii) The same is true for recognizing a lie as the other player has to tell a lie first, plus Marmot's player doesn't know what is true and what is not, so this move is even more difficult from my current point of view.<br/>- When does a scene end? Who can say \u201ccut!\u201d? How much rolls fit in a single scene?<br/>- Can you give a clue freely, like moves against that nosey Marmot? I understand that you cannot but probably that's a misunderstanding. (We even accidentally gave clues out for free sometimes.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399314/#Comment_399314" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-01T13:24:50+00:00" title="December  1, 2012  1:24PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2012 1:26PM by Ben_Lehman.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just as a note, a message on story games is a bad way to reach me. Please e-mail me (taogames@gmail.com) when you post otherwise I will almost certainly miss it. I only caught this because someone else noticed, and told me.<br/><br/>* You handled sets correctly. Formally, Marmot Detective's player says where he's going next. Whoever's set that is owns the scene.<br/><br/>* There are no scenes in which MD is not present. At least one suspect should be present in every scene.<br/><br/>* Formally, no. In practice, it's fine, as long as you know who owns it.<br/><br/>* Yes, absolutely.<br/><br/>* Whoever is most experienced at the game / has read the rules should take the lead on what to roll when. Obviously, some of the rolls rely on hidden information BUT you should probably not do a good job at lying in the game. If you're lying, it should be stage-lying, obvious to all present. Hibernation is if you need more time to wait and see how the case develops. This is a stylistic thing, it's okay if you do it wrong.<br/><br/>Alternatively, Marmot Detective can always go "I'm sniffing out a lie" and, if the suspect is being totally straight with him (why would they be, though?) the result can be "nope, no lies here." That's a pretty good clue, actually.<br/><br/>* Anyone can end a scene whenever they like. I think this isn't mentioned in the rules, though.<br/><br/>* Dropping free clues is fine.<br/><br/>Are those satisfactory?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/czipeter" title="czipeter"><img alt="czipeter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/czipeter">czipeter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399413/#Comment_399413" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-03T03:16:41+00:00" title="December  3, 2012  3:16AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2012 3:19AM by czipeter.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Ben,<br/><br/>I didn't felt like misusing these fora, but after 2 days of you not replying from your other address, I felt the need of answers. I think I am open to other people's answers, as well, especially ones who had the same problems so they can see my concerns. I don't feel that the opening post is addressed to you especially.<br/><br/>As for your answers... First and foremost: thank you. You did nail some of those things (new sets, cast of scenes, free clues, dying, ending scenes). But I am not perfectly fine, yet. Can you clarify more on the following?<br/>So M's player chooses the set and at least one of the suspects will be there. Who says exactly which ones? The owner of the set does?<br/>Then again about rolling: so your intent is about effectively some kind of roll initiator GM task to be delegated to somebody, right? Stage lying, I get it (and I think it's a boosted kind of not-stage lying and adding the player-info "and I am lying"). Then this self proclaimed GM decides (based on some kind of gut feeling / sense of drama) if Marmot is fooled or not or his player has to roll dice to decide?<br/>Detecting lies "actively": if Marmot were the one activating the rolls, then "sniffing out a lie", then rolling and finding out that they are true would make sense, yes.<br/>In a case when Marmot's player is the activating one, the suffer violence roll is the only which still sounds problematic for me. How can M's player (or even the roll initiator) make a situation where M is physically attacked without the help of the players of the suspects present?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399416/#Comment_399416" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-03T04:51:45+00:00" title="December  3, 2012  4:51AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh. I totally missed your e-mail the first time around. Got it this time!<br/><br/>The owner of the set controls of the scene. Presumably their suspect is present. Others may or may not be, according to whim.<br/><br/>Suffer Violence is generally done to you by someone else (probably a suspect). In practice, MD can force this quite easily by calling them out on threats of violence. Since there are no scenes where a suspect isn't present (except maybe the last scene), there's no way MD can orchestrate a scene in which he suffers violence unrelated to the case.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/czipeter" title="czipeter"><img alt="czipeter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/czipeter">czipeter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399482/#Comment_399482" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-03T15:07:08+00:00" title="December  3, 2012  3:07PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, Ben, I finally got what I wanted.
