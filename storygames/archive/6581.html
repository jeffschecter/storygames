I don't have a strong history with D&amp;D.  I've played third edition twice, so it was all pretty new to me and I ended up having a great time.  Here are some observations:<br/><br/>1.  Characters are fun.  All of them.  The puny halfling rogue kicked about 50% of all ass in our party.  Everybody has powers they can call on to do fun things every round.  There are choices to be made and the miniatures/combat aspect was pretty solid and engaging. <br/><br/>2.  Complaints about first level guys being utter bad-asses are a little off the mark.  I played the paladin, and my special powers were fun but not hugely unbalancing.  My favorite power - I could choose to gain a bonus based on the number of enemy dudes adjacent to me, encouraging me to wade in there and slay.  One easily-tweaked aspect that rang false to me - it seems almost impossible for a PC to die.<br/><br/>3.  It seemed pretty streamlined.  There are minion rules - one hit and they die; they do a set amount of damage, you can mow them down as though you were actually honoring fantasy tropes.  The dwarven fighter could kill these guys even when he <i>missed</i>.  Everything points at fun, which I definitely appreciated.<br/><br/>4.  It seems like the non-combat stuff waseither deliberately hand-waved for the introductory module or is the same-old same-old.  I hope the full rules allow for some fun and nuanced interaction akin to the combat stuff, but it wasn't there for the Shadowfell.  My guys has +10 Intimidation though!  W00t!<br/><br/>5.  I'm a hopeless story gamer I guess - I looked at my dragon-born paladin fighting little dragon-y kobolds and thought "what the hell?  What if these "brigands" are really the oppressed ones here?"  I decided my guy was a xenophobic racist who couldn't tell "soft people" apart - dwarf, elf, human, all the same to me.  It turned out they really <i>were </i>bad guys, though - who would have thought it?<br/><br/>6.  So much math!  Damn, +7 attack and a +2 bonus from the cleric's last thing, +1 because of this, then you roll a d20, man, I'm not used to it.  It's just adding modifiers and stuff, but I'm not used to it, and there's a nontrivial state tracking component, too.  Also, having a rigid initiative order and lots of guys with lots of options really slows things down.  <br/><br/> I'll let my fellow delvers out themselves if they want to, but I'd love to hear your reactions as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonP" title="JasonP"><img alt="JasonP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wishray.com/jp/the_penguin.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonP">JasonP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146130/#Comment_146130" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T06:40:16+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  6:40AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, thank you.

I was aiming to play the Tiefling Warlord (because I love the idea of guys who are "kinda strong", but have real power in helping other people be more awesome); but instead I chose to play the Wizard.<br/><br/>I've been playing AD&amp;D in one form or another (1st ed, mostly 2ed, a lot of 3ed too) since 1989, including years-long campaigns and GenCon "RPGA Master Events". 19 years. This was the second time in my life I've played a Wizard (the other time was a one-shot). The reason is that I just like the simple rules for fighters/thieves (or bards/clerics, who have less spells in general); I feel like there's less "strategic crap" to keep an eye on. Compare that to my friend Dave from my high school campaign, who was also a kick-ass roleplayer, but loved looking at that battlemat deciding if a Cone, Blast or Spray spell would be best for the encounter, which spell might get him out of a tricky situation, etc. <br/><br/>Anyway, I really enjoyed it. The character was 1st level and all, and I'm not sure if by 14th level we'd see the same kind of magic spell creep that normally turns me off, but I felt that even though I had a lot of spells and choices in front of me, they were pretty intuitive.<br/><br/>I named my character Lyssa*. If you can spot the Fantasy B-Movie reference, you get a cookie.<br/>(not based on the Greek Godess, but a cheesy fantasy movie)<br/><br/>The MVPs in our party were the rogue and the cleric. The rogue piled on some badass backstab damage, helping take out some major foes. The cleric was healing and hurting left and right.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>2.

I still have to roll to hit, it's no longer a given (a simple saving throw, which is easier than an "armor-based attack"). The damage was 2d4+4, and given the guys we were up against, I basically saw this as the equivalent of a weak archer archetype (weaker attacks, but long range), pinging off people from afar. I rarely had to move (though I did find cover quickly after almost getting punked on a road encounter). I hit roughly 50% of the time, so again I didn't feel too badass, and yet I didn't mind the whiff factor as much either.<br/>I could also choose tactics: Hit them for 2d4+4 damage, or hit them for less damage but slow them down? etc.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>3.

Seriously, this was one of my favorite things. Mooks are pretty tough, too, if you're not careful and let them close in on you (they can majorly fuck up your movement tactics when you're aiming at the baddies, as well as do a decent amount of damage on you). But just the fact that I can whack through an army of Goblins without having to worry about my damage roll was something that I wish I thought of in like 1994 when I was running the hell out of mass combats.<br/>As a wizard, I felt that tactical thrill of lining them all up in range, then hitting them with Burning Hands (a once-per-encounter attack), basically nuking 5 of them in one shot.<br/><br/>Also, this makes me curious as to what spells look like for wizards. Some of my spells are At Will, some Encounter, some Per Day. I'm curious to see how you choose which for which slots in-game. I'm wondering if, if you want to go for a "classic mage", you can take less At-Will and more Per-Day spells, etc.<br/><br/>(continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146139/#Comment_146139" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T07:49:36+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  7:49AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>4.

The scenario itself got a little tiring at the end, as one encounter strung into the next and the next, with no downtime in between to roleplay. But I totally buy off on the fact that this is because it is an INTRODUCTORY ADVENTURE. "Raid the Fucking Shadowfell", not "Go Talk to Some Elves about Loneliness and Ennui". The first thing that 4e-ers will want to do is get under the hood and test out that combat. I figure after about the first 1/3 of the adventure, you'll hit a stopping point:<br/>* At this point, you know all the rules you need to play.<br/>* You've got a handle on the tactics involved, and can now work on new combos and stuff.<br/>* Got that under your belt for future encounters? Cool, NOW go and roleplay.<br/><br/>What happened in our group was, as Jason mentioned, we roleplayed in the tavern (there's always a tavern), we talked in character about what to do about these reptilian fiends, etc. We squeezed it in, and it totally worked. We even roleplaying walking into two combat pieces, basically negotiating with some draconians to rethink worshipping an evil god (Nope, but at least we reconfirmed out own intentions to burn them down), and investigating their lair pretending to be fellow worshippers... for half a second before we busted out the murder.<br/><br/>In reflection, I totally have the idea in my mind that combat and roleplaying can totally happen side-by-side, and even started building a campaign world and scenarios in my head where you can bust down both with no issue.<br/><br/>To go back to 2e, which I played for years: The rules? Kinda shitty. The core book doesn't even tell you how to properly roll to attack. Yet, there's a bare minimum of tactical crunch. So our games, which were primarily 75% roleplaying... we could get it on, and not be too distracted when combat happened.<br/><br/>My problem with 3e was the fact that I always felt like I had to plan for my 12th level feats during 1st level character creation (career pathing). It was distracting. There were more role-play-ee elements to the core classes of 3e, but the combat rules (3.5 especially) were extremely distracting: It felt like I was being pulled in two directions. I want to roleplay some awesome scenes, and yet I'm also concerned with improving my attack shit as high as possible by linking feats and abilities. Attacks of Opportunity, and in Conan 5-foot-steps and armor damage reduction basically made it very hard for us to "stay off the battlemat".<br/><br/>Now? Fuck it. The battlemat comes out. When it's combat time, it's motherfucking combat time. The combat is tactically sound, if a little weird at times (Cleric ability: "I hit my enemy so hard that my friend heals himself!"). I'm embracing the battle mat/minis (lego men, etc). The game feels like a much more complex version of Memoir 44.<br/><br/>However, the game setting... it's gonna have to be a little gonzo'ed up. I can't see myself playing puny 3-hp warriors in a non-magical kingdom that run away at the sight of kobolds. Your Homebrew Setting will probably have to have lots of common magic, powerful heroes, crazy-ass villains/monsters, etc. I can see how Forgotten Realms might get converted, as well as my faves Dark Sun or Planescape, but something like Krynn or Living Arcanis (fantasy Rome) could probably not make the leap.<br/><br/>But now, instead of playing something like Mongoose Conan and losing interest quickly because a Barbarian in armor is un-fucking-defeatable (without presenting a challenge that will kill all the other characters in 2 seconds flat), and having this schizophrenic "we're roleplaying, don't bring out the mat"/"we need a mat to utilize the rules of 3.5 and get the most out of the game" experience, I've come around to be totally cool with solid-ass roleplaying, and when it's time to bust ass, we bust ass proper.<br/><br/>It felt good. This intro scenario is probably not the best "intro to roleplaying" in general, but it does a great job of introducing old D&amp;D hands to the combat system, presenting it in waves (instead of all at once) like going through the scenario book of Memoir 44 or Battlelore.<br/><br/>(continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146140/#Comment_146140" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T07:49:46+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  7:49AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>5.

Almost every damn time I was rolling to attack, I had to look all over my sheet to make sure I was getting the most oomph out of the attack. Then again, I was seriously buzzing on Weissebeir.

It's simpler than 3.5 for the GM by a long shot, and the monsters get to have way better tactics. Kobolds were actually kind of scary: they can dance around and avoid people like no one's business. (They get to take a 1-square step for free each turn, basically, which avoids attacks of opportunity and lets them be crazy annoying.) They also get bonuses for ganging up, which meant Jason's paladin and them both grew more powerful as they mobbed him.</p>\n<p>As for the roleplaying and other non-combat stuff, I bet we're going to see this turn into more of a Tunnels and Trolls-like thing. The skill list is pared down, and attribute rolls are back in as an emphasized thing as far as I can tell. This should let you pull off stunts easily, as the GM can just call for two contested attribute rolls for just about anything. I'm waiting to get the PHB before I am sure this is awesome, but I think it may be. I'm guessing the feel of this part will be more like 2E: that is, the amount of roleplaying is dependent on what you bring to the game and what you want out of it. I think we'll have better rules for it - and I know there's now "skill challenges," which are non-combat encounters - but I think the emphasis will vary from group to group.</p>\n<p>All the things Jason and Andy mentioned as awesome are awesome for the GM, too. Mook rules? Now I get to slam down 10 kobolds on a map and not think twice about it. They will mob the crap out of you - for a round or two, and then they get wiped out. It's incredibly satisfied. I also think character death may happen more than you think: the next encounter in the adventure will get nasty.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146146/#Comment_146146" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T08:21:23+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  8:21AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea that the whistling wind from the dwarf's axe as it slices air an inch from your face is enough to kill you.

You just need to know it or you will suck.<br><br>I think the way you've got one ultra-potent power to be used daily, a couple per-encounter that are pretty gnarly, and a couple of useful things you can do whenever you like is really solid design - there are delicious choices packed into that.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

It's been a lot of fun but also a felt like work at times since (a) we don't get to play as often as we'd like, and (b) we are running a published adventure path. Basically, it felt like we were going through the motions at times.<br><br>So we had a session on Saturday. On Thursday, I said to the group: "Maybe we should just ditch 3.5, and I can run KotS?" I went out and bought it that night. But everyone was a little wishy-washy about the whole thing, so we decided I would just <i>run</i> 3.5, and we would <i>talk</i> about the imminent switchover to 4e. We played for about an hour, and then I had my first TPK ever--in like 20 years of DMing. (It wasn't technically a TPK, since half the party died in the first fight and the other half died in the very next fight, but you get the idea.) I think this was everyone's deep, subconscious way of decided to make the switch.<br/><br/>I'm very excited about everything I've seen of 4e. Mostly I'm stoked about the "help" they've given GMs. Looks like the prep time will be cut down by an order of magnitude.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146160/#Comment_146160" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T09:27:43+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  9:27AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, I played the halfling rogue.<br/><br/>I battled with the concept that I couldn't always affect a roll once it had been made. That's a severely problematic situation for me - I play Fortune in the Middle, and I love positioning systems where I can state - I'll take consequences later to make this happen. So, if I can adjust my mindset, I'll be good to go, I feel.<br/><br/>I loved the game enough to order the books, though, so that should speak to my expected results.<br/><br/>To address the title of this thread, it happened when I tried to loot some kobold brigands in the first encounter. We made up some rules so that Jason's paladin could dissuade me of the idea and have a system to back it up. He rolled Intimidate vs. my Will and I submitted. I got revenge, later, when I Bluffed him into going against the kobolds again instead of heading straight to the Keep.<br/><br/>By the way, guys, we stopped just outside of the big climactic battle, you know? I have one whole healing surge left. I can already feel the trepidation that battle is going to leave me with - I'm itchy to play but concerned about death (in a fun way).<br/><br/>I think that addresses the concern about not dying too easily. I think it's all about not dying too easy on the meaningless encounters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146162/#Comment_146162" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T09:30:09+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  9:30AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SGBoston's planning on Keeping the Shadowfell this week.

My guy has 27, but 11 times per day he can recover 7, either as a combat action or at will if he's just sunning himself on a rock.  So if I manage them carefully I've really got 100 or so, but it's hard to manage them carefully.  Like many things this defies reason but it is fun.  <br/><br/>I found it deeply weird that a player is totally passive when his character is being acted upon - GM rolls to hit, GM rolls damage, you either take it or you don't.

The module really doesn't give the GM any input on that as much as we played...  I think KotSF fails as a "quick-start" module comparatively but is overall fun as a basic module.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly question from your comments...<br/>\nMook/Minion rules??<br/>\nWas this noted somewhere and I missed it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the minion kobolds were only 1hp and went down immediately, but I didn't see anything noting this made something akin to a minion rule as I've seen in other games...  Am I missing something?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway... here's my review of what we played:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2 of my pals and I play-tested through the first opening battle of the first module printed for D&amp;D4 - "Keep on the Shadowfell".<br/>\nI thought I'd post our play, fun, frustrations and outcome.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone wishing to play the module these may be<br/>\n***SPOILERS***<br/>\nwe only played the very first encounter though, but be warned.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBill and Eric took the roles of two of the pre-generated characters each, with a party of:<br/>\n<br/>\n    * Dwarf Fighter  (aka.  Ongolf)<br/>\n    * Human Wizard  (aka.  Al'Kabor)<br/>\n    * Half-Elf Cleric  (aka.  Mandor)<br/>\n    * Dragonborn Paladin  (aka.  Venril)<br/>\n<br/>\n    ...leaving the Halfling Rogue to the wayside...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe took the module out of the folder with no prep and put it down to play... one goal was to try the new rules (with the quick-start version within) and play without trying to bring too many points from our knowledge of the 3.5 rules.  It was hard.  We kept wanting to add and over-play the module with rules that weren't contained in the quick-start.  I'll note some of our questions below.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe opening was quick and clean...  The suggestion was to pick up the pre-gens and play with one of three possible "hooks".  We rolled dice and picked the 2nd option.  Little did we know this would have absolutely NO in-play value for the time we played...  Oh well...<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I quickly read through the minor "box text" to describe where and what the PCs were doing...  which was basically going to "Winterhaven" a small village that had risen up within a mile or two of the fort of "Shadowfell"  which was essentially a "hell-gate" posted on top of one of the openings that led to an evil dimension.  It was reported that an evil cleric of the Demon Prince - Orcus was looking to reopen the Shadowfell...  the PCs were going to find out what happened to Winterhaven as well as investigate (and stop) the invasion.  Or something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt suggested the players figure out why the PCs knew one another, we didn't waste our time with that, we had monster killin' to do!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter quickly drawing the large map of the area to show where they were headed on the road we immediately flopped out one of the 6 maps included.  It was a simple road view with some cover, boulders, etc...  a perfect ambush point!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146190/#Comment_146190" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T10:54:57+00:00" title="May 27, 2008 10:54AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Problem #1...  The module didn't note or suggest anything regarding how, when or if the PCs could have a chance to NOT be surprised by the ambush that was to open the campaign/module.  Although the mini-box-text noted that their were some fresh tracks on the road... with claws...  There was no suggestion on HOW or what to roll for skills or if it was allowed at this point.  So I took it on myself to allow a skill check (Survival).  After playing through the opening I get the impression that the module intended to NOT allow a chance - but rather to begin with the surprise round with the ambushers automatically winning.  I get this impression because of the first foray!  (below).  So in the end I'd answer this problem by assuming that this module is NOT a "how to" or a "sales piece" for D&amp;D4...  its literally a module to begin a campaign.  So unlike "Keep on the Borderland"  which rocked as a "how to" opening module (considering I just read/ran it again recently).  There was no real pointers or notes on anything to run the game or help with the management of GMing that I saw.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the Half-Elf blowing away the Survival skill check he learned what these tracks were from and roughly how many there were.  So it was no surprise when the PCs made their "2 movement rounds" as noted in the module to begin the game, that the ambushers showed themselves...  Unfortunately the PCs blasted the initiative and acted first killing 2 (it should have been 3 after rereading the blast radius)  of the little ambushers on the very first action of the game.<br/>\nBLAM!!  With his "SCORCHING BURST"  incinerating 2 Kobold Minions immediately!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the little Kobold ambush party (who would "fight to the death rather than be tortured for leading anyone back to the lair")  was actually surprisingly tough.  The minions (5) were nothing to kill with only 1hp each, but 2 actually lasted until the last few rounds with some use of the terrain and their commanders. <br/>\nSpeaking of the commanders - the tactics suggested that the Kobold Slinger (1) and the commanding Kobold Dragonshields (2) would wait and watch as a second wave.  This worked well...  Letting the PCs think they were in total charge.  Then came the challenge.  The Dragonshields were TOUGH!!  at second level and with some very cool tactics and abilities that aided those tactics.  The slinger did a fun great job of playing cat and mouse dodging from foilage to foilage.  He barely made it out of the fray when the PCs converged but after he did, he survived pelting the PCs to the last rounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dragonshields had a COOL ability of being able to "shift" (essentially the same as 5' step) anytime an opponent shifted next to them or when a PC moved away...  Which surprisingly surprised and beat several key points of tactical movements of the PCs.  That was very cool for the little guys.  As commanders they also got bonuses for other Kobolds fighting side-by-side with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis lead to one of my favorite improvements that I've seen so far.  Although Eric questioned if its not just a simple name change...<br/>\nI liked what seemed like a simplification of the actions to no full actions, etc... each character can take a:<br/>\n<br/>\n    1 Standard Action <br/>\n    1 Move Action <br/>\n    1 Minor Action<br/>\n    unlimited Free Actions<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also substitute actions:  a Move/Minor for a Standard  or  a Minor for a Move.<br/>\nAoOs aren't gone - but there's a name change to Opportunity Action.<br/>\nThey also added Immediate Actions - either Interrupt or Reaction.  Which seem to work well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe little ambush/combat seemed to roll well, as Bill noted it seemed EPIC even for 1st level characters.<br/>\nWe did have some questions and problems here they are:<br/>\n<br/>\n    * Does Charging provoke and Opportunity Action (Attack)?  The quick-start rules weren't complete here and read as if it does.  Why then would you ever want to charge and trade a free attack against you for a +1?<br/>\n<br/>\n    * Can you move both before and after the attack at will?  The quick-start rules read as if you could.  We had problems because we kept thinking "well you can't in 3.5 so..."  which is a problem not knowing.<br/>\n<br/>\n    * The Kobold Minions damage rating for their Javelins were confusing.  It simply listed  "4"  in the area where damage normally was listed.  I checked the other monster entries in the module and it was consistent.  It didn't seem like a one place typo.  However it was one of the very few listings that DOES have a straight damage listing and no die type to roll.   So our question was did these little 1st level minions get to do straight 4 points of damage if they hit??  It made them more dangerous for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n    * Do skills have a default action type?  For example - Stealth doesn't note anywhere if it's a Standard/Move/Minor Action.  However some other skills DO list if its a Standard action, Minor, Free, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146191/#Comment_146191" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T10:55:09+00:00" title="May 27, 2008 10:55AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Other thoughts...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSaving Throws:  apparently from the notes of the quick-start a saving throw is now simply a 50/50 check, roll a D20 and get a 10 or more.  At least that's all the quick-start said.  There's no bonus listed for the various saves anymore.  They're a straight DC level number.  As some attacks attack to hit one of the saves.  The wizard's spells he cast tried to hit Reflex and Fortitude for different spells.  Which was neat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills:   the skills are greatly condensed,  I didn't read up on them all yet.  but the ones you'd expect to be condensed are and it's great.  Perception and Insight were two of my favs.  The skills were wildly short-changed in the quick-start though, Stealth (for example) only had 3 lines, so I can imagine the depth is alot better in the full rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nDelay &amp; Ready??   We couldn't find anything for these actions.  They seem very necessary to the style of D&amp;D overall but in the quick-start we couldn't find anything.  However, in the module it noted that the Dragonshield Kobolds would wait and go following the Minion Kobolds even if their initiative was higher, which then lowered their initiative to one below the Minions.  (ie.  Delay)  But it never noted either.  So we DID allow for "delay" actions (as per the module)  but  didn't allow Readies for this play-test...  which ended up stinking for a few normal tactical plans...<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter Sheets:   the layout of the PCs and Monsters weren't really intuitive or well laid out or designed.  I really REALLY hope they have some simple STANDARD layout as they eventually developed for D&amp;D3.5 as well as M&amp;M.  It was difficult to find things.<br/>\n<br/>\nNPCs...  I don't know about the rest of the module but the opening combat gave no suggestions for role-playing the Kobolds.  There was no info on Kobold's style or personality, etc...  If I were a new player I'd have no clue.  I had fun and ended up making up names and personalities on the spot though...  (the "Drar"s were the commanders and they rocked)<br/>\n<br/>\nPCs abilities:  Bill and Eric would have to note their thoughts on the PC's special abilities, but it seemed like the players had several neat (and powerful) options even at 1st level..<br/>\n<br/>\n"Marking":   many of the characters  (NPCs and PCs)  could "Mark" a target, giving different abilities per the character like giving the target a negative modifier if they don't attack the character who marked them or other things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that's it!<br/>\nOur "play-test" went about 3-4 hours,  and something like 7-8 rounds.  <br/>\nNot quick, but we were stopping to reference nearly everything just to be sure of the rules, not taking anything for granted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI had fun, I think the players did. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nany thoughts?<br/>\n-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146193/#Comment_146193" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T11:12:55+00:00" title="May 27, 2008 11:12AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>One more note - we got through three combat encounters in four hours, with five players.</blockquote>\nJesus.

Your epic destiny ensures that your name and exploits live on forever.<br/><br/>"Perhaps most important, your epic destiny describes your character\u2019s exit from the world at large (and more specifically, from the game) once you\u2019ve completed your final adventure. It lays out why, after so many adventures, you finally take your leave of the mortal realm\u2014and where you go next."<br/><br/>Ok, officially even more excited. There's plenty of room to roleplay in that. Yeah, this happens at 21st level, but think: 21 levels x 10 encounters per level / 4 or 5 encounters per session = ok, still about 40-50 sessions, but that's real doable.<br/><br/>Edit: scanning the internet, it seems a lot of people hate this and say it's not D&amp;D.

I had six players and I printed out the "bonus" character (<a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/files/TieflingWarlord.zip" rel="nofollow">tiefling warlord</a>) for the extra. <br/><br/>We got through three combat encounters, in about 5 hours, and I spent the first 45 minutes just talking about the rules and stuff. Slow starting for us. We also had time for some role-playing in Winterhaven, the little town. There was a bit of "run around asking NPCs stuff to figure out what to do next," which is an annoying requirement of the adventure as written. My group was itching for some role-play beyond "we ask the old farmer in the bar what we should do next."<br/><br/>The players in my group captured one of the kobolds in the first encounter. He'd been knocked to like -1 hit points, and I forgot that monsters don't go to negative hit points; they just die. I realized it right after that, but decided to give them a prisoner. The paladin and cleric (both of Bahamut) decided to take the kobold to Winterhaven to see if they had a jail there, instead of slaying their prisoner. The town doesn't include a jail, so they ended up paying Valthrun, the weird sage in the tower, 1 gp to take Gorm the kobold off their hands. When they returned a week later, Gorm was working as Valthrun's servant. Sorta. He was a little sniveling and fearful servant and wasn't good at it. We had a great comic scene about them going into the kitchen to find Gorm. Valthrun said, "He's probably in the kitchen, but be very, VERY careful." That had the rogue searching for traps (and finding them! trip wires on the floor that dropped pots and pans on them, bags of flour falling out of cupboards, oil on the floor, and so on!).  They eventually bribed Gorm (with a whole lamb bought from the market) to lead them to the kobold lair. That was the best scene of the game, and it was ad-libbed by me. <br/><br/>The mook rules made my life very easy as a GM; they're dangerous foes who pack a mean punch but they do fixed damage and they fall if hit at all, so you don't need to track their hit points. There were many points where an old D&amp;D player would ask me how something worked -- like movement, spell effect areas, saves -- and I'd give them the answer and they would say, "Oh thank God" in relief. 4E fixes a lot of broken stuff and makes everything easy.<br/><br/>The players loved having stuff to do all the time. The players of the cleric and wizard especially had fun. The cleric felt like she could kick ass, take names, and still be party medic. The wizard loved having 22 hit points and a low chance of dying from even a few good hits, plus not running out of spells. <br/><br/>As promised by the reviews of the game, combat no longer turns into "stand in one place and roll to hit." Everyone is constantly moving around, positioning for advantage, shoving enemies around, shifting here and there, and so on. It feels more like a chaotic fight. At one point, the wizard was all excited that he had like four kobolds within a 3x3 square and he was gonna use an area spell on them when it was his turn. Without even <i>trying</i> to subvert him -- purely through organic movement of the things and the way the combat naturally seemed to flow -- the kobolds had totally repositioned by the wizard's turn. He shifted tactics and did something else useful. <br/><br/>Perhaps because we had six characters, there weren't many times the party was sweating. Only once, the paladin got whacked twice in a row and got low in hit points, but healing surges fixed that quickly. Perhaps the Inside Kobold Lair or the later encounters would be more challenging. I suspect they would.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146237/#Comment_146237" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T13:33:40+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  1:33PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, many of the powers rely on knowing pretty well where you are, relative to each of the opponents and/or allies, as far as I can tell.

Certainly a lot of kobold abilities.<br/><br/>The kobolds, for example, get to "shift" (one 5-foot square step) as a minor action instead of a move action. Some of the kobolds got to shift as a free action when threatened in certain circumstances. Those shifting abilities would be very hard to adjudicate without a map.<br/><br/>Also, area of effect spells seemed to be pretty important. The various blasts and bursts really need a map to understand who is standing next to whom, and if there are PCs in the blast area, as well.<br/><br/>You could play without a battle mat, but you'd be giving someone an advantage most of the time. Probably the players.<br/><br/>I used cardboard counters instead of miniatures, and used the printed battle mats that came with the adventure. For something of my own, I'd use easel-sized graph paper with a one-inch grid on it and just draw out the map as necessary.

The black boxed set.  It basically has an adventure path set for each of the four major classes that allow you to quest for Immortality. I remember that like Thieves IIRC had to "achieve an unattainable goal" like "drive all dragons from the kingdom; build a floating castle". Fighters had to retire their character, and play each as three other character types from levels 1 to 9 (IIRC), I dunno why perhaps to experience different fates? Then they return to their own bodies.<br><br/>The Immortals boxed set was for "what happens AFTER THAT", which I thought was kind of a stretch. But man, those original D&amp;D master/immortality quests were pretty epic, and each represented about a year of real time gaming out the quest.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>EDIT: This one:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://paizo.com/image/product/catalog/TSR/TSR1021_500.jpeg"/><br/><br/>(and as Clinton mentioned, the rules were also imported into the Rules Cyclopedia as well)                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146252/#Comment_146252" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T14:30:00+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  2:30PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Adam &amp;  jenskot,  but I'm still not fully getting why these actions you both give as examples couldn't be easily described without a battlemat...  (again I'll note that I likely WOULD use a map, I'm just playing devil's advocate to see if I can find a reason why it's not a good idea to go mapless...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Example...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRULES:<br/>\n"The kobolds get to "shift" (one 5-foot square step) as a minor action instead of a move action. Some of the kobolds got to shift as a free action when threatened in certain circumstances. Those shifting abilities would be very hard to adjudicate without a map."<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIN-PLAY without a battlemat:  (using an example from my play)<br/>\nPlayer 1:<br/>\n"Wow... my wizard is in trouble!  Al'Kabor steps back [shift - minor action] to be out of range of the Kobold Minion's spear!... then he..."<br/>\n<br/>\nGM:<br/>\n"oh but wait Al'Kabor... the knarly little dragonkin-warrior screaches at you - instinctual fear causes goose bumps to raise as the chill of coming death at the end of a Kobold spear scampers closer!!  This little reptilian is of the Dragonshield - you can see the scars across his back-scales where his commanders have beaten this tactic into him... MOVE FORWARD!!  Pester and prevent the enemy from escape when you press,  and be deceptive and quick when you withdrawl they preached...  As Drar-Kul forces Al'Kabor into a difficult decision...  Unknown to Al'Kabor, these little ambushers are trained to keep under feet during all but the most speedy withdrawls.  The Dragonshield is again forcing melee.  What does Al'Kabor do to continue his actions??<br/>\n<br/>\nTo quickly explain the tactical effect of this.  Essentially the Wizard has "lost" his advantage in using a minor action to move away, because of the Kobold's special ability to shift anytime anyone shifts in or move away.  The Kobold's still within 5' of Al'Kabor, but you have another Move and Standard Action to continue..."<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer 1:<br/>\n"crap!!  Okay... I use another minor (in replace of my move) to shift again,  then use a Healing Surge to get my second wind (ie. Hit Point recovery and hoping the Kobold can't shift twice in a round - which they can't)"<br/>\n<br/>\nGM:<br/>\n"Excellent,  hehehe... I love these neo-Kobolds!!"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo battlemat...

All of them have some sort of descriptor for how/where powers and abilities effect.

If I (as a player) have to rely on the good heart (and memory, and three dimensional imagination) of the GM, then part of my enjoyement is gone.<br/><br/>I'm actually seriously considering DnD again after almost 20 years just because it now seems like a good ruleset for what it wants to do. And for maybe the first time it knows what's that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Let me expand: I remember when playing WHFRP. When there were more than a couple of opponents, and the location/terrain was to matter, we actually used minis (or markers, dice and rubbers, it does not matter). And I remember how that made the difference: If my warrior can charge for 8 "spaces" and thus deliver a stronger attack (often decisive), I need to "see" it as a choice on the table.<br/><br/>Let me expand more <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>I played very few of those "trad" games, actually... but I never considered their combat systems interesting or engaging. And the minutiae like the precise area of effect and so on would be ditched in play, probably. But they did not need to have a sexy combat/challenge system, IMO: they were not about that (or, where not supposed to be). DnD is about that (and almost only that), in my eyes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146264/#Comment_146264" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T16:00:39+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  4:00PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.  You are correct.  I'm assuming (like many RPGs) the GM adjudicates most of the "scene" action, correcting for/with the player as they describe what they want.  All RPGs and interactive story telling involve a little of this negotiation and description to define the scene.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOR you can draw a map.  As simple as a few points on a piece of paper  to  a detailed battlegrid with miniatures and environments.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end I'm still not convinced that 4e "needs" a battlemat more than any other RPG.  It certainly encourages one.  It can be beneficial to the minutia of the rules.  But ultimately it seems to be that anyone can have just a good/fun time telling my story with or without a battlemat when gaming with D&amp;D4e or Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/>\n<br/>\na serious question...<br/>\nSince when did D&amp;D become all about making tactical decisions to overcome challenges?  <br/>\nThat certainly can be a part of the experience but if it were the only options the game wouldn't have social skills or abilities - it'd be Warhammer.<br/>\nFor me playing D&amp;D is more about the epic fantasy of being a hero,  not moving my beans around and counting them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again - I'm inclined to bring a more story approach to anything I game with.  I remember my brother just not getting why I wanted to add a "natural disaster and urban development" phase to Axis &amp; Allies...  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blake%20T.%20Deakin" title="Blake T.

src="http://moviedeaths.blacktachyon.com/grabs/krull-ynyr-1.jpg"/><br/><i>"Lyssa!! It is I, Ynyr!"</i><br/><br/>Anyway, one thing that I forgot to mention, which I was reminded of:<br/><br/>So, I mentioned that the combat and all feels internally consistent, if not a little quirky. However, one thing that I'll need to see is how a "boss battle" works.<br/><br/>We didn't have time to take down a climactic enemy ("Boss"), but to tantalize us and get us familiar with the rules, the DM (Clinton) read out his special rules.  IIRC, every time his HP go down to a certain point (bloodied?) he can do something like this berserker rage, and at the same time heal his own HP back.  So basically, I see us having to quickly clear the room and basically focus all attacks on this enemy.<br/><br/>The special rules and conditions kinda rang to my ears *exactly* what Matthew G tells me that WoW raid boss battles are like. <br/>"First the boss does these things. Then, when the boss takes X HP, he does that. And you all have to stand here, and have the priests buff the warriors, and..." etc.<br/><br/>The kinda transparentness of that is giving me pause. I just have to get in there and see what it's like in person, but that's maybe the only place where I'm really thinking, "Man, dunno how I feel about such transparent MMO-lifting". And I'm sure others had already hit that stage waaaay before hand.<br/><br/>However, the other thing is that I can totally see a HUGE, BADASS PC-vs-Monster fight going down on a tabletop at a con, with like 15-30 players, where everyone is Doing Something, Helping Each Other, Being Useful, Tactically Mapping Out Advantages, and doing so altogether in a way, mechanically supported, which we've never seen on the roleplaying tabletop before. Not like this.<br/><br/>I'd love to see a 4e implementation of Iron Heroes-style Zones as well. Once I get basic combat under my belt, that is.  But zones in 4e I think might make things a little more complicated, and totally badass at the same time.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146272/#Comment_146272" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T16:34:10+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  4:34PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2008 4:39PM by kevperrine.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow....

There were entire trees of movement- and AoO-related feats and not a few spells that turned into trash when we played 3.5 without a mat.  As long as everyone knew not to take those feats/spells (and was allowed to swap them out if they turned out to be entirely irrelevant to our game), we were fine playing it the way we wanted, even if it meant ignoring one or two features of the system and bending a few more out of shape.  And their last Star Wars game (Saga Edition?) worked brilliantly without square-by-square movement, and that was the last WotC product everyone said required miniatures. <br/><br/>But how many is "a great deal" in 4E?  Half of the powers ruined?  Three-quarters?  An entire class rendered useless?  I ask because I think 4E sounds nifty as all get-out, but I guess the only way to answer that is to wait for the core books to arrive and go over them.  (So far, it doesn't sound completely impossible for people who have in the past proven their willingness to agree that "all of these feats will now suck, and we're fine with that.")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146279/#Comment_146279" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T17:14:56+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  5:14PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Count me as another fence-sitter who ordered the game because of this AP.

So that was a roughly 6.5 hour gaming session. We had five players plus a DM, with every character but the Tiefling Warlord represented.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I was very pleased with the polish on the module, level of detail, and overall organization (there are a few snafu's, like talking about bull rush for several pages before explaining what it does; also, the book doesn't tell you what "recharge" does... and before you have to go hunting, recharge  means that an ability recharges when one of those numbers is rolled on a d6).<br/>\n<br/>\n- I wasn't too pleased that the social and exploration encounter rules are not represented in the module. I wasn't pleased with the fact that there were so many combat encounters littering the beginning of the module.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Overall play speed seemed good. I feel like with a little practice the game will run faster than 3.5 core.<br/>\n<br/>\n- There was a lot of good rock-paper-scissors action, like the fighter trumping dragonshields, the rogue dealing the megadamage (eek! but not Palladium megadamage...), the wizard rocking minions pretty savagely, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n- We got through the first encounter ("road"), the second encounter ("ambush on road"), the third encounter ("fight outside the lair"), and the fourth encounter ("fight inside the lair"). The first fight was easy for the party, the second was tougher, the third was easy, the fourth was very nearly a TPK.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I was excessively happy about the fact that none of the characters seemed to be a weak link whatsoever. Everyone had a role to play and interestingly, the players all more or less figured out their roles just from reading their abilities. So I think that was some elegant design work there.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I've written a few additional non-combat encounters for the actual main body of the crawl better explaining the backstory; I felt like the exposition that occurs toward the beginning and then the encounter didn't do it enough justice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146310/#Comment_146310" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T20:34:16+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  8:34PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright...

I felt like I had lots of interesting choices to make each turn, several of which would be worthwhile, but I could only choose one of significance.  This made combat very interesting to me.  As has been mentioned earlier, some of the powers don't have a clear relationship between cause and effect (like how my hammering the bad guy with my mace causes my deity to heal my friend a little), but it was still pretty awesome to be able to fight and save a party member's life at the same time.  <br/><br/>I'm still thinking that 4e is a little strange, but I did order the books and expect to have a lot of fun with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146319/#Comment_146319" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T21:38:14+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  9:38PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2008 9:38PM by Chris Peterson.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D 4E requires a battlemat, but look at Andy's cover shot of the D&amp;D Master Rules: <i>"This game requires no gameboard because the action takes place in your imagination."</i><br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146323/#Comment_146323" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T22:20:37+00:00" title="May 27, 2008 10:20PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Chris Peterson</cite>D&amp;D 4E requires a battlemat, but look at Andy's cover shot of the D&amp;D Master Rules:<i>"This game requires no gameboard because the action takes place in your imagination."</i><br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nAmen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146333/#Comment_146333" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T00:01:05+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 12:01AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2008 12:03AM by renatoram.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Kev">@Kev</a>:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Since when did D&amp;D; become all about making tactical decisions to overcome challenges?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nUhn... from the very first edition, actually.

I tried explaining them "the rationale is that that's a balanced number of time in terms of challenge and story"</blockquote>\nHmmmm. Well, some folks are championing the "removal of Sim" and all that. Personally, I just think that more easier to explain than that, is that this is the new Armor Class, Hit Points, or Spells Memorized Per Day. An abstraction to get used to, get over, and find ways to ret-con explain it.<br/><br/>I mean, Spells Memorized Per Day was a big reason I didn't like mages: I couldn't explain it "in world", given whatever game world I was using (and all that shitty old TSR gaming fiction never had the mage characters memorizing spell lists, they could pretty much cast whatever they wanted anyway). In fact, I developed <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=93125" rel="nofollow">"Dragon Magic"</a> way back int he early 90s to combat that "problem". I used it only a few times (mostly for cleric characters, actually), but otherwise just got over that abstraction.<br/><br/>Seriously, someone who can come all this way, riding hit points, believing in armor class (way back in the days of 1e/2e, where it was simply explained that big fat heavy armor made it harder for people to *hit* you), and following "memorized laundry list of spells", can suddenly find an incommensurable problem with "daily abilities"... baffling.<br/><br/>The only thing is that, as mentioned above, you'll have to rig your homebrew worlds to be epic centers of magical awesomeness. Low-tech gritty doesn't work so well anymore. Krynn would be hard to do, IMO. People just expecting to convert their homebrew world without retooling the setting will probably find problem points in various character powers, rules, paragon paths, etc: Either the 4e rules, or their setting concept, will have to give a little to be commensurable.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146367/#Comment_146367" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T06:52:27+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  6:52AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite>I think it was a preview article at WotC that used an example that I really liked, explaining this phenomenon as similar to that of running a marathon.

I remember thinking "why don't we take a big nap between every encounter?

Ie, like if in monopoly you could just wait around without any consequence and then draw a salary from the bank, it'd be a currency bleed. I use the word bleed because it bleeds all uncertainty/tension from the games currency system.<br/><br/>Although that's a wet dream for a simulationist who can put up with the gamist mechanics, cause they can drag the whole thing on forever if they wish and the mechanics become items of examination and exploration, rather than a trial.<br/><br/>3.X suffered from this as well. Sharp combat mechanics, then - well, you could just sit back and heal/regen spells. Sure, the GM could stick a time limit on or such like, but why put up with all the handling time of all those rules and crap, when following them precisely only matters when the GM adds (a time limit) to it? If the GM's sharp enough to make it fun, he could make his own system with the time he spends attending the failings of the purchased game.<br/><br/>It'll probably be a schizoid design again, where the gamist elements alienate the simulationist inclined players, and the currency bleed alienates the gamist inclined players. Not that it wont get snapped up - the skism takes awhile to detect and is hella hard to articulate in an internet forum (ie, it wont interupt the buzz for awhile).<br/><br/>Of course I win either way - either I'm grimly correct, or wrong but they have produced a game with no currency bleeds so yay, it'll be fun! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Hope this isn't considered a poor post - I've outlined the exact metrics I'd measure it by (currency bleed being one).

From 1e-&gt;3e, while there has been changes in creatures and setting assumptions, for the most part those assumptions have been stable enough that my longstanding campaig setting that I grew around them could be adapted to any changes. I love much of the fluff material associated with D&amp;D and am not eager to abandon or redesign it to adapt to the more radical changes in fluff/creatures/cosmology/etc. that came with the IME overzealous "reimagination" by the stable of designers.<br/>2) Resource management. With healing surges, per encounter power, and the like, the focus of 4e has become the encounter, and there resource management is a much less important element. I find this regrettable because I found putting the pressure on the players by draining their resources to be a major element in brewing excitement in the game.<br/>3) Removal of risk. There's a lot of extended discussion that went into this but I'll boil down my attitude: threat of loss helps build emotional tension in the game. 4e's design philosophy seems to go out of its way to sanitize and normalize threats in the game, which IMO takes much of the sense of wonder and dread out of the game.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Clark Peterson seems to agree with my philosophy on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, and it seems very likely that Necromancer Games' products forthcoming for 4e will address some of these tastes, which will be useful if I find myself in a 4e game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146556/#Comment_146556" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T20:51:51+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  8:51PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>Man, and this thread was going so well, too.</blockquote>\nYikes, man, there's no thread-knifing going on here!  <br/><br/>Admittedly, the thread has twisted and turned from "our 4e experience" to "let's talk about 4e", but no one is being a dick.<br/><br/>Well, <i>yet</i> anyways.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>(just wanted to chime in to give more discussion, opinions, thoughts a fat thumbs up.

But then if someone else thinks the game encourages PCs to play inchworm-style, fighting once and then hunkering down for a nap to get their neat-o keen daily powers back, the game still gets slammed for doing something wrong...although why this is so doesn't seem clear to me, since the whole model of having multiple combats in a single day before resting seems to me to have sprung up out of D&amp;D in the first place (it's certainly not a fantasy-novel meme!).<br><br><br/>(Edit to add:<br/><br/>Hey, I cross-posted with grey_spiral, who has actual information; that does indeed sound like there's some incentive to push as far ahead as you can as fast as you can, which sounds neat.

Just because the characters are taking a siesta doesn't mean that the baddies are as well. Something as simple as a basic time line with little events that happen after a certain amount of time has passed could be enough to keep the players moving forward, trying to stay ahead of the event/encounter curve. You can rest up and refuel, but then you might end up getting hit back to back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146734/#Comment_146734" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T16:00:51+00:00" title="May 29, 2008  4:00PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't that part of what wandering monsters were for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146736/#Comment_146736" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T16:12:40+00:00" title="May 29, 2008  4:12PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something that a friend of mine pointed out: if you rest, you lose all the accumulated Action Points (and regain only one).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I seem to recall that only one can be spent per encounter (which sounds counterproductive to me), but in any case you'll have to think about what's more beneficial: taking a nap now and lose your AP, or go on with a bit less resources and your APs?<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, the healing surges seem pretty powerful to me: your true HP total is much, much higher than what's on your sheet as a cap.

There's a lot of extended discussion that went into this but I'll boil down my attitude: threat of loss helps build emotional tension in the game. 4e's design philosophy seems to go out of its way to sanitize and normalize threats in the game, which IMO takes much of the sense of wonder and dread out of the game.</br></blockquote>I suspect you may be mistaken that 4e takes these two things out.

Let's say you press through six encounters without stopping so you have 4AP stored (assuming you didn't use any in those encounters). But having 4AP in your encounter with the 7th, 'boss' battle is no much use if you can only spend 1 in that fight. You might as well take an extended rest beforehand anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even if that limit were lifted, a full refresh of all powers, hit points and healing surges is worth a loss of 3 extra actions, in my book.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Now, if burning an AP could let you take a bonus action <i>or</i> let you 'recharge' a Encounter (Daily?) power, and you could use them as much as you liked in any encounter, then that would be a more interesting decision. Do we face the boss battle with up to five shots of your "big" powers, but running dangerously low on HP and Healing Surges? Or do we take the safer option, albeit with less effectiveness in the fight, and take an extended rest beforehand?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146904/#Comment_146904" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T12:06:09+00:00" title="May 30, 2008 12:06PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2008 12:07PM by Hituro.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the spirit of Game Chef I have to ask ... is 4th Ed a roleplaying game?<br><br>By which I mean is it a game where roleplaying is actually part of the game?

Everything Else is very loosely defined. That's where the roleplaying happens. And since there are not any real deterministic rules (AFAICT) on how roleplaying affects the game, then that means the roleplaying should be able to take the story in any direction. The game tells you to roleplay. It tells you that that is the point of the game, which means that it's part of the game. But instead of making you roll dice when playing your role, it gives you a virtually rule-free sandbox to do it in. Complete freedom on anything non-combat-oriented.<br><br>Further discussion (if you want) is probably best taken to a new topic, mind.<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146917/#Comment_146917" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T13:29:52+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  1:29PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I must say, the builds on the characters in the Shadofell are pretty tight. I just got my copy of the D&amp;D 4e set (thank you Amazon), and I went ahead and rebuilt my Wizard using the 4E PHB in the way that I wanted, that I thought would be cool and possibly more powerful... turns out that she came out much the same way, maybe just like one spell difference in the end, and one feat (I traded in Improved Initiative for the one that gives me a +1 to all my defenses). I even kept the staff specialization. I used the default character get (16, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10 iirc), and pretty much when I was done I had my Shadowfell character with like 2 minor differences.<br><br>Next, when I was hearing stories about 4e and how it doesn't have a single power that doesn't do anything on the square-map, I was disappointed. I still had a little of that sense before I actually saw the book. "My character's shit is all combat goofiness! Where the hell are those awesome spells like Tensir's Floating Disk and the like, the ones that are non-combat, and that make you use some strategy to overcome obstacles?" Well, turns out all I had to do was turn to the "Rituals" chapter.  All that shit is in there. "Oooooh, nevermind."<br>That rocks, though: They finally split out the boom-boom combat spells that you would use in combat from the laundry list of creative non-combat spells. I'm still a little iffy about the fact that even these rituals seem to have a boardgamey/"can be replicated on a battle mat" component, but with this VERY well-defined split, I don't have to keep roaming through the spell list looking for those few useful combat spells and having to gloss over the creative one: I can easily manage both, and in different ways to boot.<br/><br/>After a skim, and positive experiences with the combat system... Man, it's making just about every other TRPG combat experience (especially that d20 Conan bullshit I went through) look like tasteless, odorless oatmeal (with the exception of The Riddle of Steel).  It's really made me think about what combat in RPGs should be like in according with the design/feel of the game. I think just part of this is that I'm still in that Honeymoon Stage, though: I thought the same thing about 3e (which I played for years) in comparison with 2e when it first came out, but later I lost interest in it for other reasons (namely all the character prep/planning in the days before I knew of the E6 Hack).<br/><br/>Finally... I'm pulling out an old fantasy campaign that I ran in 2e and 3e out of the closet, and converting it to 4E (Sandy Canyon Wasteland, Stargates, Empathic Halflings, Buddhist Half-Giants, and Airships).  I have to ExXxTreme-ify it a little (that campaign was perfect for like 1-6/1-8 level adventurers), and I might still keep it a 1-10 level "Hero" camapiagn only. I'll probably start running it again in the late summer or fall. <br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146919/#Comment_146919" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T13:49:59+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  1:49PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2008 1:52PM by Chris Peterson.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>I just got my copy of the D&amp;D 4e set (thank you Amazon)</blockquote>\nI'm pissed/bummed at Amazon for selling the 4E set with 40% discount <i>and</i> pre-release shipment.

The Ritual list is very limited (although will definitely be expanded with future supplements). But more importantly, the casting times are prohibitive. Before I could use Silence, Arcane Lock, Hallucinatory Creature, Passwall or Tenser\u2019s Floating Disk in very creative ways in combat to create amazing roleplaying moments. Silence used to be a standard action. Now it takes 10 minutes to cast. Most rituals takes 10, 30, or 60 minutes to cast. There are definitely rituals that should take longer to cast. No question. I just wish there was more room for creativity in combat, moment to moment. Although I am glad for all the tactical options!

I always remember a complaint of Ron's that fighters were frontloading the best tactics (like sword choice) before play, and wizards were all about choosing the best tactics during play (like which spell to cast), and fourth seems to have really worked on that with encounter, at will, and per day abilities for everybody, as well as creating a game with more focus on play, and less on prep, for all the players at the table.<br/><br/>My impression so far is that fourth is a big step up from 3.5.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146954/#Comment_146954" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T18:46:03+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  6:46PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>Jonathan, I think that's right on, and I share that feeling about front loading.

It is so focused, finally, on what it is trying to do.  A lot of the crunchy stuff is really inspired and reminds me of the great tactical crunch stuff I loved in Mearls' Iron Heroes.

What I think Mike is referring to when he says his "XP budget" is, for example, what it would take for the characters to advance however far he wants them to advance in the time spent in the dungeon. Want a one-level dungeon? Calculate the amounts of XP needed by the party to advance one level, and there's your budget.   I don't see an explicit Agonesque thing where a DM gets <em>n</em> more XP to spend on baddies when the party refreshes, but it'd be easy to houserule that in if people do start taking naps after every room.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147016/#Comment_147016" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-31T12:53:03+00:00" title="May 31, 2008 12:53PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I could well be wrong, but I think the XP budget is indeed there (in the DMG guide to building encounters).<br/><br/>Sure, it's not tied to the rest scenes like in Agon, but still...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147042/#Comment_147042" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-31T18:43:55+00:00" title="May 31, 2008  6:43PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The budget thing is in the DMG under encounter design.

Here's a bit from the 4e DMG, p. 56:\n<blockquote>Step-by-Step encounters<br/>1. choose an encounter level. Encounter level is relative to the number of characters in the party. An easy encounter is one or two levels lower than the party\u2019s level. A standard encounter is of the party\u2019s level, or one level higher. A hard encounter is two to four levels higher than the party\u2019s level. <br/>2. Determine your Xp budget. multiply the number of characters in the party by the XP value of a monster of the encounter\u2019s level. <br/>3. Spend your Xp budget. You don\u2019t have to spend the exact amount.
