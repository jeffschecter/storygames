Building generational ships to leave cluster<br/><br/><br/>Prologue:  <br/><br/>While on a routine patrol, Prince Sui-Long of Balon found an ancient Oggian spacecraft being looted by his enemy, Leaf Eriksdottir of Glion.  Leading a team of marines, he boarded the vessel and fought against Leaf\u2019s crew.  Their battle was interrupted by the arrival of Mickeyian dreadnaught that promptly claimed the vessel for themselves.  Leaf got away with an Oggian survivor, Muju, who had been in coldsleep within the ship, while Sui-Long\u2019s life had to be saved by Dr. Ara Bellingway, a Mickey doctor who encountered him on the ship and left her people to make sure he survived.<br/><br/>On returning to Balon, Sui-Long\u2019s disgrace led to his family disowning him.  Taking a ship and loyal crew, including Dr. Bellingway, he vowed to hunt Leaf down.  The two finally fought again in orbit over ruined Ogg.  Sui-Long, Dr. Bellingway, and his marines managed to board Leaf\u2019s ship, but another Mickeyian ship arrived, destroyed Sui-Long\u2019s ship, and severely damaged Leaf\u2019s.<br/><br/>Only Sui-Long\u2019s piloting skills save them, as he points Leaf\u2019s engines toward the planet and rides the thrust down to the surface.  They find themselves on the surface of a ruined world in a radioactive crater in a ruined ship.<br/><br/>Chapter One:  Escape From Ogg<br/><br/>Once the ship is down safely, more or less, the trouble begins.  Sui-Long decides that they cannot stay on the ship, as he set them down in a lake bed.  While the ship\u2019s thrust evaporated most of the water, the crater will fill with radioactive water.  He orders his men to collect food and supplies so they can go in search of a better location.<br/><br/>Leaf\u2019s crew, however, see it as Sui-Long trying to take all their supplies.  Muju, whom Leaf enslaved to act as her personal engineer, stirs up a near-riot in the ship\u2019s cafeteria, as he blames Sui-Long for leaving him to Leaf\u2019s tender care and hates Leaf for enslaving him.  Sui-Long defuses the situation and convinces everyone that he will get them all out of this situation alive.<br/><br/>The ship\u2019s interface vessel is, more or less, intact, but its berth will be submerged if they wait for the storms their re-entry caused to subside.  Sui-Long pilots them in a terrible electrical storm.  The interface vessel is badly damaged, but he manages to set it down in a clearing near some ruined arcologies.  He hopes that they can find some Oggian tech to help them.<br/><br/>The next day, after the storm abates, they set out in the interface vehicle\u2019s jeep, looking for supplies.  They find the remains of an archaeological camp of some sort and manage to salvage a generator.  The sun sets as they head back, and they are attacked by two creatures that Dr. Bellingway identifies as mutant descendants of the Oggians.  Whatever they are, they are fast and apparently hungry for human flesh.<br/><br/>After a night huddled in the interface vessel, listening to the mutants banging on their hull, they decide to set out to find the creature\u2019s nest.  Tracking them, they find it is in a ruined arcology.  They try to sneak inside and set some explosives, but a sentry startles Dr. Bellingway, and she shrieks, waking the whole tribe.  Some quick thinking on Sui-Long and Muju\u2019s part lets them use their explosives to kill the mutants.<br/><br/>Returning to their interface vehicle, Muju struggles to repair it with little luck.  They encounter a survivor of the archaeological party, which apparently was from Jasper and had come to raid whatever technology they could find from Ogg.  The survivor is shell-shocked, almost feral, and they have to track her back to the archaeological party\u2019s interface vehicle, now a wreck.  Muju hopes to get some parts from it.<br/><br/>While hunting for food, Leaf and one of her crewmates, Olaf, find signs of recent energy blasts.  They deduce that the Mickeyian ship had sent someone down to look for them.  After some debate, Sui-Long and Leaf agree to send Dr. Bellingway and Olaf to find the Mickeyians and try to get their help to get off the planet.  Since Mickey is the most advanced planet left in the cluster, Muju sneaks away after them, and convinces Dr. Bellingway and Olaf that Sui-Long sent him to join them.<br/><br/>Dr. Bellingway and Olaf find the Mickeyians, led by Captain Emil Menard.  Captain Menard is happy to see Dr. Bellingway and Muju, as he was seeking them specifically.  He has his men disarm and then kill Olaf as a pirate, and Muju is only too happy to give him information in return for preferential treatment.  Leaving one guard behind to watch Dr. Bellingway, who protested Olaf\u2019s killing, Captain Menard sets out to capture Sui-Long and Leaf.<br/><br/>Captain Menard and his men attack the survivors\u2019 interface vehicle, attacking it with superior weapons.  Sui-Long desperately fights back, using his tactical acumen to kill one Mickey soldier and terribly wound Captain Menard.  The Mickeyians win the day, however, and capture Sui-Long and Leaf.  The rest of their crews are summarily executed.<br/><br/>Back at the Mickey base, Dr. Bellingway manages to escape and sedate the remaining guard.  She and Muju struggle to get his gun.  When she grabs it away from him, he tries to convince him that going to Mickey is their best chance in this miserable cluster.  She refuses to listen to him and marches out into the forest.  When she learns of what happened to the rest of her friends, she is forced to return and surrender.<br/><br/>Next Time:  In the Asteroid Prison Mines of Mickey<br/><br/>Notes:  I ran this game for my wife and another couple and made my own character, Muju, as part of the character and cluster creation process.  He became my GMPC for the game, always causing trouble and trying to escape the two other characters he blamed his miserable lot on.  In the end, he became the Dr. Smith (Lost in Space) of the group, trying to take control when he could.  In the end, he betrayed the party and they ended up captured (despite a desperate battle against the Mickeyians).  They had a chance to accept a concession where they would survive but the Mickeyians escape (after Captain Menard was wounded.)  They decided to reject it and fight on, and unfortunately lost.<br/><br/>All in all, the players were glad to have a chance to make their characters grow in an unexpected direction, and we all learned some things about how to (and how not to) fight. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  My wife, for instance, forgot that her character had Close Combat as an Apex skill and just kept shooting rather than closing to fight.  Mistakes were made on both sides.<br/><br/>We've decided to take a little break (while Sui-Long's player runs Time and Temps) but we will return to these characters to see how they've done as prisoners of Mickey, forced to work on hollowing out asteroids to make generational starships.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250373/#Comment_250373" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-11T16:21:01+00:00" title="January 11, 2010  4:21PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is awesome, Jeffrey!
