Note to people who haven't read T&amp;J: starting characters start with 10 pts of Qualities (non-super abilities) and 6 pts of powers.  Roll 2d6 and add the total of Qualities and Powers applicable.<br/><br/>First Character: Thug with Bat: +4 with a baseball bat.  Now, TwB will pasturize almost every example character listed in  the T&amp;J.  Most of the example characters have +2 or +0 in their base combat.  On 2d6, +2 (+4 vs +2) is a huge advantage. Looking at the example characters most of them have most of their points sunk into Qualities and Powers that basically function as color.  For instance, Snow Owl's flight doesn't help the guy at all in resolving conflicts (Flight at +0).  It's just a way for the player to describe SO showing up on the scene.<br/><br/>Why does this matter to me?  When I play a system I want to be able pump the fuel lines with nitro step on the gas and GO! I feel like with T&amp;J to play characters like in the book I've got to play three-speed Schwins.  TwB can give most of the book characters a lot of grief, let alone the high-octane critters I normally come up with.<br/><br/>They way I've seen T&amp;J kind of work is by actually throwing away the system.  The GM I'm playing with looks at our abilities and makes a call; no dice, no rolls.  So "decribe your character and the GM tells you what happens" is a pretty good alternative to T&amp;J as I've seen it work.</blockquote>\nHe comments that the system doesn't seem like it could take a lot of heavy lifting.  PDQ, I think, is all about using your Qualities in a way that applies them to the situation.  You fight on your terms, not the bad guy's.  PDQ does not have a 'the terms' (combat works such-and-such, arguments work this-a-way), it has your terms and your opponent's terms.<br/><br/>In this case, you fight the Thug With Bat on your terms, not by standing in front of him swinging your own bat.  You make his Qualities less important (while at the same time the GM is trying to make them more important).  Truth &amp; Justice has a bit about how a fight between Superman and Batman would go down, it always makes me smile.<br/><br/>The T&amp;J game I played in had the Orange Ogre as a reoccurring villain, he WAS Thug With Bat (or rather, Thug With Supersteroids), and he would always get a good clobber in before we reworked the situation to our advantage.  (Unfortunately, I played the clobberin' type, so I was usually the bait.  Ouch.)  There have been multiple times when playing PDQ where I said, "Well, I guess I could make this situation like *this*, I hope it doesn't break."  I don't think it ever has.<br/><br/>EDIT: Well, geez, I thought I'd see if other people posted before me when I preview my post.

If the character is Fireblasting, +2.<br/><br/>The T&amp;J yahoo group discusses Meta-Powers regularly, and there are a number of perspectives on how to do it.

If Snow Owl was super-stealthing up on normal criminals, I wouldn't even make him roll. If there's a super-villain in the mix, I would make him roll.<br/><br/>Another factor that might be sticking in your craw is that in PDQ-based games, a lot is abstracted (up to and including Qualities and Powers) to reflect story-importance/effectiveness/importance to character rather than flat kill level/effectiveness.<br/><br/>Combining the two things above gives you this: by taking Super-Stealth at Average [0], Snow Owl is saying (in effect) that he wants to usually sneak up on normal thugs, and he's okay with just having a chance to sneak up on super-baddies -- while being stealthy is part of his character and adventures, it's not a gigantic part of it or the adventures he's involved in. If he'd taken it at, say, Expert [+4], he'd be saying that he wants to be really damned stealthy, against everyone all the time, and it's an important aspect both of the character himself and the types of adventures he has.<br/><br/>Does that make any sense?

There are exceptions like Invulnerability that completely pwn normal attacks, and Super-Strength gets a massive damage add.

When I've been writing for T&amp;J I've treated putting "Super-" on the front as indicating that the ability is raised to the super scale (or perhaps something more complex as a Super-Quality, but I've generally avoided labelling those that way). If that is the case the super scale rules apply and affect when/whether you roll the dice. Basically, if something's a power rather than an ordinary Quality there should be significant extras in what you can do with it.<br/><br/>Re the Snow Owl Super-Stealth example (T&amp;J p63-4), I think that's just an error in the write-up. In the player-GM dialogue they're treating it as if it were a "Stealth" Quality. If it were truly a super-scale version of Stealth the villains would only get a chance to roll if they had super-scale perception abilities.<br/><br/><br/>EDIT: It probably looks like Chad and I are giving different answers.

But I know Liminaut, and I play in the same campaign as Liminaut, and I think - THINK, mind you - that I have at least a bit of an understanding of what Liminaut is talking about here.<br/><br/>Here is the problem as I see it - bear in mind that it may be specific to the way our campaign is played, and being far away from my rules set I may get some citations wrong - so don`t yell (insert smiley face of your choice here).<br/><br/>The big difficulty that I see with T&amp;J comes in the stacking of multiple qualities and powers that allow you to hit some pretty impressive numbers - to the point that the difficulty numbers in T&amp;J become fairly meaningless in some cases.  This is particularly a problem in combat because it appears, from some of the material written in the rules, that as long as you have a superpower to base your attack on, you can load all the normal everyday qualities you want on it and they give you the normal benefits.<br/><br/>As a sort of general example, let me modify Liminaut`s TwB character to TwBB - ``Thug with Bat and Battlesuit``  Spend a couple of points to give yourself a Good quality Battlesuit.  This, if I recall, gives you the ability to take a certain number of regular qualities in addition to your Battlesuit ability (I don`t remember offhand how many).  Use those quality points to buy ``baseball bat`` at whatever level.  Now convert all your additional super power points to regular qualities (again I don`t remember what the point discount is for converting superpowers to regular qualities).  Spend all those points, plus your regular quality points, on qualities that make you good at hitting things with a baseball bat ``Professional Ballplayer``, ``Hit things with a large aluminum bat with unerring ferocity`` etc. etc.<br/><br/>What happens now is that you have a character who can lead with a superpower - ``Battlesuit`` for both attack and defense, and can stack a whole mess of quality modifiers onto Battlesuit.  The character has more levels of Qualities than your average character, which means he can take more damage than your average character,  and the character can crank out modifiers way in excess of +6.<br/><br/>This strategy does not have to limit itself to beating people up.  For example take a character with the superskill ``Super investigation`` at ``Good`` and a whole mess of investigative skills that can be stacked with it, and you have a character who will blow the doors off of any mystery scenario in one or two rolls.<br/><br/>It seems that an easy solution to this problem is 1) limit how Qualities can stack with superpowers, 2) make the optional higher difficulty levels non-optional.<br/><br/>Anyway, my two Canadian cents from Rougemont.<br/><br/> - Shosuro-san                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94642/#Comment_94642" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T08:24:11+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  8:24AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Shosuro Kando</cite>The big difficulty that I see with T&amp;J comes in the stacking of multiple qualities and powers that allow you to hit some pretty impressive numbers - to the point that the difficulty numbers in T&amp;J become fairly meaningless in some cases.

His other four sub-specializations on Baseball Bat should be taken as stunts, and he'll be tearing through his Villain Points to get much value out of 'em.<br/><br/>An alternate take:  Stacking should only be allowed when you're adding apples and oranges.  Let the Thug take 5 different ways of saying Baseball Bat.

I want to zero in on one thing in particular.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite>Anecdotally, I have to agree that Snow Owl comes off as kind of a wimp in the sample combat. I don't know how much of that is me.</blockquote>\n<b>On Snow Owl, Super-Wimp</b><br/><br/>He's going up against two opponents at once, so I'd expect him to struggle at least a little bit.  As with most game systems, getting outnumbered sucks, unless there's something that lets you deal with multiple numbers easily.  <br/><br/>In T&amp;J's case, that "multiple numbers" thing is all about the super scale vs. normal scale... most heroes can simply walk through an undifferentiated mob of normal scale folks with a single roll.  When there's a super in the mix, it gets a bit tougher.<br/><br/>Snow Owl's outnumbered for the first part of the fight, with the super foe Bob Brick having a fairly twinked out build for a minor villain: Super-Armor and Super-Strength.  He's going to dish out ludicrous amounts of Damage Ranks and be able to suck up Damage like nobody's biz, so he has to be defeated more via Failure Ranks.  Snow Owl does NOT act optimally for much of the fight, which helps to illustrate the workings of the system.<br/><br/>But once he does gets his act together, it's pretty interesting: he neutralizes the normal-scale dude pretty much for the rest of the fight with a simple use of his Frost Manacles.  Then he gets creative and whacks Bob Brick with failure results rather than damage results.  He takes the day.<br/><br/><b>On Problems For How I'd Run Things</b><br/><br/>That said, I still think it should have been a fair-er fight than it was, and this is due in part to the implementation of Super-Strength, and whether PCs are normal-scale or super-scale when it comes to sucking up punishment.<br/><br/>Super-Strength lets you add the TN of your Power Rank to damage upon successful attacks, period.  This sort of bonus -- adding the TN to your damage ranks -- is something <i>every other attack power in the game</i> only gets to apply to non-living, normal-scale opponents.  I'm comparing this to the (Something) Blast power as a baseline.  That power requires you to spend a Hero Point to apply super-scale damage to living targets.  I'm not clear on why Super-Strength doesn't have the same requirement, and one of my first house rules would be to require a Hero Point expenditure to treat your Super-Strength as super-scale vs. living targets.<br/><br/>You then have the question of what scale PCs are by default.  By watching Bob Brick beat on Snow Owl, it's clear that the default answer is: PCs are normal scale damage receivers unless they have a Power that says otherwise. Invulnerability explicitly states that it sets its possessor on the super-scale, getting rid of the extra Ranks of damage from Super-Strength (the Super-Strength writeup in my copy does not say that the extra damage is only vs. normal-scale, though that may be inferred by the behavior of other powers).  Super-Armor's writeup does not explicitly state that it sets its possessor on the super-scale, though one could make the argument that it does.<br/><br/>Looking at all of this together, I'd say that I'm fine with Super-Strength not costing the extra HP, but that all PCs are considered super-scale by default, or that PCs are considered normal-scale by default but Super-Strength requires the extra HP like all the other attack powers do.<br/><br/>A small tweak either way, but something that I think needs to be foregrounded in the considerations of a GM prepping to run T&amp;J.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94659/#Comment_94659" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T09:08:04+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  9:08AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's two other specific powers behavior issues in T&amp;J that I want to highlight.

For Manticore, he takes 3 Good[+2] powers, trading them in for 6 points of qualities each, a total of 18.  Sounds good until I realize that if he'd taken a different powers package -- 6 Average[+0, treated as +1] Powers, he'd be able to trade in each at 4 points each for 24 points of Qualities.  The simple fix here is to use that as your baseline, and say that every point of Powers you trade in gets you 4 points of Qualities.<br/><br/><b>Super-Speed</b><br/><br/>Nothing else in the game offers multiple actions the way that Super-Speed does.  The closest we get is a "multiple targets" thing, where the character takes a downshift for each additional target.  So my immediate urge is to limit the way in which Super-Speed can take its multiple actions.<br/><br/>For the "multiple targets" analogue, the situation's pretty straight-up: because you can take multiple actions, you can do several no-downshift attacks, each against a different target, no problem, and you can do the multiple targets downshifting thing, per action, to hit even more.  This, I'm fine with -- you're not getting the Super-Speed MOD added to these efforts, you're instead using the special ability of extra actions afforded by it.<br/><br/>But I would add onto this a "no double-dipping" rule -- you don't get to attack the same target twice (or do the same [other thing] twice) in one turn.  Or rather, if you do, then that's done as a <b>stunt</b> on Super-Speed.  Want to use your Super-Speed as a straight-up super-scale damage-power?  Stunt.

I can't see clear to the system-function-conscious reasoning for it, so it gets rejected by my brain when my brain decides to seek consistent implementation choices.<br/><br/>To try to de-opaque my perspective: I think of Super-Strength as having a reasonably fat penumbra already.  When adding in "+TN damage for no HP cost" to its set of specific abilities, it feels like it's going off the deep end in comparison to stuff like a Fire Blast that <i>does</i> need the 1 HP for +TN damage.  I'm not sure Super-Strength's limitations are balanced out by, say, its lack of range (especially when that range is arguable what with Manhole Cover Discus and Lamp Post Jousting options on the table).  Penumbra coverage is a "soft" way of addressing the differences between powers, but you're giving a solid mechanical difference with the HP-free +TN damage ranks effect.  I feel like it makes Super-Strength a vastly preferable attack power compared to pretty much all the rest of them, which is why I get the urge to house-rule it back to the realms of equivalence.<br/><br/>Super-Speed also has a fat penumbra in my brain.  You're getting super-scale movement almost certainly (unless you consider Super-Speed just to be about taking multiple actions) among a number of other possible applications before getting into stunts.  All other things being equal -- let's say Averages across the board -- a dude with Super-Speed of Average is going to double the number of Damage Ranks he's hitting a single target with, or at least take the number of DR's heading his target's way from a 50% chance to 75-100% chance of happening.  If he has the as-designed Super-Strength at Average as well, those DR's range from 7 to 14 in a turn.  It's a little too much single-target abuse for my taste without bringing stunts into the mix.  Making Super-Speed an attack power by way of a stunt, gets things more sort of where I'd want them to be, and adding in the "no double dipping on targets" rule makes me feel like, as a GM, I'm not producing a revoltin' development <i>every single time</i> I fling a Super-Speed opponent at the PCs.<br/><br/>This all said, I do think I "get" the desire to make Super-Speed and Super-Strength feel like they mean something big, and I think that's what you're going for with their default implementation and function.  But with that in mind, I have to come back with the other side, which is ultimately where I'm speaking from: if Super-Speed and Super-Strength get to feel extra-big, doesn't that mean everything else gets to feel extra-small?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94727/#Comment_94727" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T12:06:47+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 12:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>This all said, I do think I "get" the desire to make Super-Speed and Super-Strength feel like they mean something big, and I think that's what you're going for with their default implementation and function.

And in my house-rule thinkery around Super-Strength I'm trying to land in the neighborhood of making sure those toughnesses don't get devalued. I think the 1 HP/everyone is normal-scale unless they've got Invulnerability etc implementation keeps the value of those powers.<br/><br/>Size-shifting's fun to look at in comparison.  I do think you're right that it stacks up reasonably well.  I'm figuring that when I swing a punch with let's say Good[+2] Super-Strength, I'm getting a +2 on my roll to hit, at least (or so I assume -- looking at page 64, second column, the GM talks about Bob getting a +0 for Super-Strength on the to-hit).  If I connect, I'm getting 9 extra damage ranks landed -- essentially the equivalent of having gotten 4 or so upshifts, but conditioned upon landing the blow.  Size-shifting for Growth, my dude's probably getting a +2 from Size-Shifting to his attack to start, then according to the power, another 2 upshifts (essentially +4 in modifiers) to the roll.  So my dude's getting an increased chance to hit (+6 vs the Super-Strength guy's +2) in exchange for doing 5 fewer damage ranks when he connects.  I'm assuming right now that there's no "super-scale" concern here, though if there was it'd certainly cost the HP.  Personally I'd prefer super-scale damage against living to come out of a stunt on the thing, at the least, or asking that the character also have Super-Strength to go along with his size-shift...  All that said, regardless, the comparison looks reasonably good.<br/><br/>Phasing is an odd duck; the writeup's all about advice to the GM as to how to limit the power, though I don't feel like I came out the other side solid on what my "best bet" is for limits.  Probably something to feel out on a case-by-case basis.  But as written, it's an interesting power all the same, essentially asserting Invulnerability to an even broader scope of damage-sources, with some extra bells and whistles.\n<blockquote>And again: house rule away!

Say, for example, you want a character who is an incredibly awesome detective - one who never misses a clue.  If you can manage to stack modifiers up to +18 or so then you have that character who literally cannot fail unless the GM throws a revolting development at the character.

TWB&amp;B is just a simple example character.  The same principle of stacking modifiers could be employed to do far more interesting (and powerful) things than simply hit people with a baseball bat - that`s just the example I used because its the one Liminaut started.  The same stacking ability can be used for just about any `specialty`that a player may want.  As a reasonably creative person I feel confident that I can come up with a minimum of three quality penumbras that are sufficiently different that each can stand alone, yet each intersect in order to be stacked in my specialty area, be that hitting folks with a bat or knowledge of arcane mysteries or whatever I am interested in having my character spend most of its time doing.  I am also reasonably certain that I can crank all three of those qualities up to Master (+6) level, giving me a +18 to my roll when acting within my specialty with enough points left over to have at least one superpower at Good (+2) to put me onto the superscale.<br/><br/>The problem, to me, is one of efficiency.  To me this seems like an extremely efficient build.  If I want a combat character I take three qualities that all intersect at the `hit things`point.  If I want an investigator I take three qualities that all intersect at the `discover clues`point.  For whatever I want my specialty to be I can basicly blow the doors off the static TNs of the system PLUS I have three penumbra qualities at Master level that can be used on their own that give me pretty fair chances at succeeding at most of the static TNs on the PDQ chart.  Based on the characters previously published, I don`t think too many of them can routinely generate a +20 or so modifier when they they do whatever is considered their specialty.<br/><br/>I have no problem with a certain amount of efficiency in builds, but this seems to me to be taking things a little far, to the point where what becomes most important in character creation is making sure the GM will let you stack all your modifiers, rather than whether you have an interesting character.  The difference between someone who has a +6 modifier (the most you can get without stacking Qualities and Powers) and someone who has a +20 modifier is huge in this game - enough that for me it has the potential to be unbalancing and limiting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shosuro%20Kando" title="Shosuro Kando"><img alt="Shosuro Kando" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/Pippet_sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shosuro%20Kando">Shosuro Kando</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94846/#Comment_94846" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T16:05:26+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  4:05PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite><br/><br/>Your Thug with 5 different ways of saying Baseball Bat is quintuple-dipping on the same Quality over and over again, by my book.

The ability to creatively come up with qualities that stand on their own and yet intersect at some point is inherent in the system - otherwise stacking wouldn`t be permitted.  You may not agree that the particular abilities listed are stack-worthy, but that is just arguing over definitions of a given quality.

And the issue is basically 1) since Qualities and Powers stack, it puts Qualities and Powers on basically the same scale and 2) 6 points isn't a lot for super-powers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94962/#Comment_94962" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T03:36:24+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  3:36AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keep it coming Fred.

Invulnerability can be affected by "big" normal attacks, and Super-Armor can be downshifted to wash all damage, so I'd say it's about a draw.<br/><br/>- Versus super-scale attacks, Super-Armor is better because it shrugs off low ranks (MOD or less) and can be downshifted to wash damage, whereas Invulnerability gets no particular bonuses. Big winner = Super-Armor.<br/><br/>Is there some perk to Invulnerability I'm overlooking? I originally thought it was that Invulnerability put the defender on the super-scale and Super-Armor didn't, but per Chad elsewhere that's not the case (at a minimum any super defense counts as super-scale, which makes sense). Normally I would consider comparing "effectiveness" of two powers in a light system basically pointless, but since they are so close conceptually it seems relevant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95256/#Comment_95256" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T15:42:25+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  3:42PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good question, Ben -- I'd like to see what Chad has to say to it before I try to figure it out myself.<br/><br/>As to the gadgetry, I've read it, and it has not hurt me (in fact, I'm on a fresh read everything in the game at this point save for the settings).

Compare it to something like Body of Flame, which can be used for defense plus lots more. Perks like immunity to normal-scale help balance that out (per my interpretation of the design logic anyway).<br/><br/>Super-Armor works the same way, except Super-Armor gets much better perks even though it has a (probably) broader penumbra -- you can easily have things like blasters stunted off of your armor, a la Power-Armor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95770/#Comment_95770" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T22:18:14+00:00" title="September 13, 2007 10:18PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>And they are, at least a bit -- they get a +6 on their defense rolls, no?</blockquote>\nYep, but compared to someone with Master [+6] Super-Armor they are total wimps.<br/><br/>Sure, that's true in most cases.  I do like that when the 14 ranks of normal-scale damage come knocking, the Super-Armor dude has to downgrade his armor or take 14 damage ranks, while the Invulnerability of Average dude laughs in its face... but I hear you, all the same.
