I posted <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/podcast/2011/06/30/episode-30-boarsdraft-playtest-1a/" rel="nofollow">audio</a> from the session on my podcast <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/podcast" rel="nofollow">Designer vs. Reality</a>. We ran into a few rough spots with the rules, which I think someone listening ought to be able to pick up on, and also had some observations in our discussion at the end. We wanted to start a thread where we could have some questions, further comments, and conversation about the playtest and the game.<br/><br/>I GMed that game, and I had a lot of fun creating background setting details for it (maybe <i>too much</i> fun...). I had names and basic descriptions for 13 NPCs before we even did character creation, I created names for textbooks for all the classes (which I didn't even need in the session), came up with the basic mystery and a number of red herrings... I find the somewhat whimsical setting to be really fun to create for, since you can establish good NPCs by coming up with just a simple descriptive shorthand and an interesting character tic. In practice, I think I was so focused on getting some of these details out that I was somewhat out of synch with the players. For example, in the train station, I was trying to just showcase an NPC's personality and was thrown off a little bit when one of the players started interacting with her. Part of that was probably self-inflicted by liking my own ideas too much, but part of it I think is coming from the obligations of getting the details of the Mystery and the Red Herrings out on the table for the players to observe. This is compounded by the fact that it's hard to work those details into the story organically before the students get to the Boarsdraft school. During all the scenes with the characters getting their acceptance letters, I had all of these details floating around in my head but I wasn't able to talk about them yet. Then, when it was appropriate (at the Welcome Feast), I started giving as many of them as I could I felt like I was dominating the conversation and doing an exposition dump, so I still didn't present all of the details that I hoped to.<br/><br/>In the last scene of the session, all of the players did an Investigate action, which resulted in the Mystery Pool being almost entirely wiped out. I was caught pretty flat-footed by this as a GM. I hadn't even laid the groundwork for most of my Red Herrings, which are supposed to be definitely resolved when you get the Mystery Pool to 50%, and I had a hard time organically working details of solving the mystery into the scene since the players have so much influence on what the scenes are about, and weren't moving the scene in a direction which made sense for the Mystery I had planned. I hope JB talks about this a bit. I think this was my biggest disconnect with the game.<br/><br/>In the dice system, it seemed like the players really weren't responding well to the decisions they were supposed to be making. They essentially need to pick a trait and a skill, and possibly some other things, which give them resources. And they also need to pick a reward and a risk, and rate the strength of that risk numerically. And then they roll the dice and count successes, with the success/failure determined by consulting a table based on the types of risk and reward, and they need more successes than the amount they risked. All of those decisions seem pretty tightly interconnected, and it didn't seem like they had a good feel for how to make them. It was kind of like pulling teeth to get them to give me the number for what they were risking. And from a GM's POV, there weren't really a lot of ways for me to interact with that part of the game, mostly I'm just waiting for the players to make a bunch of decisions. Maybe that would change once they started building up negative reputations, etc., which would let me add to the difficulty? Hard to say. From my POV, it felt a lot like the players deciding whether they wanted to get a pass or a failure on the roll, since it seemed pretty easy to engineer either one. Sometimes it seemed like the players were actually more interested in achieving the "risk", such as when Scott wanted his character's mother to be an enemy. I'm not sure if playing that way is against the intent of the game. It felt to me like there wasn't a lot of tension or excitement about the dice rolls. We also had a lot of confusion about when and why we should be rolling the dice, so maybe we were doing it wrong.<br/><br/>That sort of raises the broader issue of it being unclear to us when you are supposed to play out the scene. There are a lot of mechanical decisions you need to make that feed into the dice rolls and the results, and it's not clear whether the scene is supposed to dictate them, or they are supposed to dictate the scene, or what.<br/><br/>I'm sure there's other stuff (and there were comments in the podcast that I haven't repeated here), but hopefully this is a good enough starting point for a conversation.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332829/#Comment_332829" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T19:58:12+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  7:58PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mystery Pool:  The big problem, which led to the session ending in a bit of confusion, was the Mystery Pool. I spent a great deal of time tinkering and balancing the Mystery and Struggle pools. All of that number crunching led me to make an obvious misinterpretation of how the players would go after the pools. I had no idea how agressive they would be going after the pool. I've worked out a patch for the system that I'll playtest with my home group but I'd be willing to share as well. <br/><br/>Order of Opperations:  This is the one that really had me stumped. I've looked through the scenes section in the book time and again and I'm just not seeing what you guys saw (and so obviously its there and I'm just reading it differently) which is that there seems to be a certain order to which you set up a scene. The way I tried to write that section was to give the players a framework to make sure that they have everything they need to resolve the scene by the end.  Players should start off with an idea of what they might want out of the scene and an idea of where they want it to start but everything else can be in flux up until the point that the player rolls their dice. <br/><br/>What does the GM do:  Dan is completely right when he says that GM's don't have much to do during conflicts, particularly early on. I'm working on changing that by adding in hooks that GMs can grab onto during character creation.  One thing that I think the GM should be doing is suggesting risks, rewards and the level of those things. I need to put that bit of advice in there. <br/><br/>Difficulty and difficulty:  One thing that came up early and often was the confusion between the two types of difficulty. While looking at it now it seems obvious I really did not know what I had done there. The simple truth is that they are both elements of the difficulty which in my mind were linked. They are linked but they are not the same. I've already started revising those areas and refering to the part of difficulty where each individual die must beat a certain number as "height" and the number of dice that need to be successful as the "width" of the difficulty. Hopefully that will help clear some of that up. <br/><br/>Presenting the setting:  Hey Dan, you did good being subtle with the clues and expansive with the characters that the players grabbed onto. The rules didn't help you with the investigation going so quickly but you were doing fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332836/#Comment_332836" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T21:04:53+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  9:04PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JBMannon</cite>I've worked out a patch for the system that I'll playtest with my home group but I'd be willing to share as well.</blockquote>\nI'd like to know what you're thinking.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JBMannon</cite>I've looked through the scenes section in the book time and again and I'm just not seeing what you guys saw (and so obviously its there and I'm just reading it differently) which is that there seems to be a certain order to which you set up a scene.</blockquote>\nI think it happened like this: We say, "OK, it's time for a scene." We turn to page 24, and it asks us "Where is the Scene?", so we answer that question. Then it asks us "Who is in the Scene?", and we answer that. Since those two steps are required for framing any scene, and that's the order you start presenting things, we make the reasonable assumption that you're presenting the questions we need to answer in order, so we keep going down the list. And then we start to get nervous when it looks like we're getting to the end but we haven't hit any steps that say "start playing out the scene in-character". Your rules read like they're procedural, so we followed them as if they were outlining the procedure. If we were meant to leave those questions unanswered, play out the scene for a while, and then lock them down... do you actually say that anywhere in the rules? I admit I could have missed it, especially since I was finding it difficult to locate stuff in the rules doc while we were playing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JBMannon</cite>One thing that I think the GM should be doing is suggesting risks, rewards and the level of those things.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure I'd be interested in doing that. I don't envision myself having a vested interest in those things to the extent that I'd want to advocate for them. And if I did, I'm not sure that merely suggesting things would be enough. But that's just a visceral reaction to a vague statement of your intent, so maybe I'm not seeing it the way you are.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JBMannon</cite>The simple truth is that they are both elements of the difficulty which in my mind were linked.

Is it intended to produce a specific sort of feeling? Is it tactical? In play it seemed like they were making these decisions arbitrarily, even aside from the question of confusing terminology, and it's not clear to me what this mechanic is bringing to the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332851/#Comment_332851" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T05:22:19+00:00" title="July  2, 2011  5:22AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mystery Pool patch: The patch I'm experimenting with is that the Mystery Pool only gets depleted by one in each investigation scene. The width of the difficulty is equal to double the number of students in the scene added to their year. Feel free to give it a shot and let me know how it goes. <br/><br/>GM investment: So let me ask you, what would be fun for you to be doing during scenes?  I had at one point a rule that allowed the GM to add or remove difficulty using the Struggle Pool as a kind of bank. Would that make you feel more involved?  What would make you feel more engaged?<br/><br/>Important decisions/Order of Opperations:  The decision to risk a certain ammount over another is a somewhat tacticle decision based on what makes sense in the fiction. Let me explain, the students are sneaking down the hall and the grounds keeper and his dog appear. The first student with an idea decides to runn out and try and distract the dog and grounds keeper. That student figures that this is a Sport and Courage test and that he needs one more failed test to improve his Courage. So he decides he is going to try for failure and sets the width one die higher than he has dice. He still does not know if he succeeds or fails until after his friends who have bought into the scene have rolled. And I just realized that the other players should have a chance at any point before they themselves roll dice to get out of the scene.   I'm seeing that I need to better organize the scene section with a "Before You Play the Scene" and a "Before You Roll Dice" sections and add in advice about why you want to set the width at different levels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332857/#Comment_332857" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T08:13:37+00:00" title="July  2, 2011  8:13AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like you're on the right path to addressing the things we fell down on in play. So I'm going to ask a different question that didn't directly come up in play but I feel could be an issue down the road. You let the players make up their backgrounds including their parents. And as I demonstrated in play, you even have a chance to make enemies, rivals, friends, etc, out of these player created NPCs. I'm sure if we tried a little harder - and certainly during summer breaks - we could've made relationships with the other PCs' families. At the same time you have the Headmaster (GM) making up NPCs for the school and mystery and whatever else he or she needs. <br/><br/>It seems that the players could become more invested in their own NPCs and the NPCs that their fellow players created than in any of the GM's characters. I was already most interested in learning more about Bran's dad and where he's been (but getting to know the Soothsaying teacher was a close second, he was cool). And, of course, I wanted Rod's mom to not just be an enemy but to be enmeshed in the mystery and maybe even a pawn of the big baddie. Now a good GM would make this happen without having to be told, but you can't count on that (and I'm sure Dan would have, given another session - he seemed to know just what to do with her). So is there something in the game to tell the GM he or she ought to be doing that or for the players to impose their NPCs onto the plot at some point? I think my wood nymph mom is cool and it doesn't matter if anyone else agrees because if the GM doesn't include her in something other than summer break I'm going to be cross.<br/><br/>And maybe that's contrary to the fiction - Harry's despicable family was only important in the summer and only for the first few years (of course, his actual parents are important as plot devices later). But if the player created NPCs are intended to be that limited, you need to ensure that that is clearly conveyed. Regardless of the fiction, I think it could only benefit player investment to quickly and deeply involve their NPCs in the ongoing story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332873/#Comment_332873" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T11:10:17+00:00" title="July  2, 2011 11:10AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2011 1:42PM by JBMannon.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scott: I've been thinking of how to add more player investment into the start of play. One change I'm concidering is only allowing the students to answer one of the four questions with the name of another players student. I've been working on a few extra questions to help flesh out the NPCs created that way. I'm also adding in for sure a friend/good reputation and enemy/bad reputation to the parentage section to give players expand on their families in a way that is already happening but in this case I want to give that mechanical weight. That will also give the GM hooks to grab onto earlier.<br/><br/>Someone, during the wrap up, mentioned beliefs or something similar. I like what beliefs do in Burning Wheel but what they do best is to make players choose between two or more beliefs. I think I might be able to do the same sort of thing by letting each player choose from a limited list of goals for each year.

I think spending/removing points to monkey with the difficulty would make things feel more adversarial, which I don't think feels right for this game. At a high level, I think I like the idea of working in details, hints, and clues from the background, Mystery, and Red Herrings into scenes that are mostly focused on player agendas, but I'm worried that right now that's very ephemeral and relies on human discipline rather than any kind of mechanical feedback in the design. I've been mentally toying with the idea of a "bingo" mechanic to do this sort of thing in another game, but my thoughts aren't fully baked.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JBMannon</cite>That student figures that this is a Sport and Courage test and that he needs one more failed test to improve his Courage.

To me, it reads like a semi-arbitrary decision followed by a gambling decision, not something where I'm weighing interesting pros and cons. Do your players dig the interaction between the height and width in setting up this roll? I'm having trouble imagining myself getting excited about this decision -- in my head it feels like I'd just go through a rote process of picking the number to match my risk-tolerance.

Maybe. I'm not sure. It felt to me during play like the players were playing simultaneous solitaire and I was waiting for them. I didn't find that fun. Maybe that would change later on as play developed, but I'm not sure how. Right now, I think it feels too much like (warning: hyperbole ahead) the GM is taking on the role of the event cards in a game like Arkham Horror rather than the role of an interactive human at the table with the other players.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JBMannon</cite>The thing your missing, I think, is that the characters have five classes each year that they need to pass.</blockquote>\nAs I understand it, from a purely mechanical perspective: failing a class reduces your skill. If you have a low skill, you can only pass low difficulty tests. You essentially set your own difficulties (aside from your possible new Investigation mechanic).

Would have to see it in action to know for sure, though. I think making the difficulties external to the player will probably make it easier to make the decisions (and provide an incentive for increasing skills), but I'm on even more tenuous ground predicting that since I haven't actually tried it from a player's POV.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JBMannon</cite>5) As the scene plays out, the GM and students have an oppertunity to bring in resources.<br/>a) Negitive resources the GM brings in add to the width but not the Risk or Reward.</blockquote>\nThis can be tricky, so I'm not sure how I feel about it (since there weren't many failures in the session we played I didn't really get an opportunity to see how this worked in practice). I know that when I GMed Mouse Guard, when I tried to do it with an "improv style", I felt really uncomfortable throwing things at the players: I'd either feel guilty for throwing something hard at them, or else like <i>I</i> was the one responsible for their success if I was giving them a cakewalk. When I switched to prepping everything ("If they fail this roll, they'll get an animal twist and an owl will attack"), I could enjoy GMing the game -- I knew the difficulties were appropriate (because I prepped them to be) and I could appreciate the players' contributions without feeling like I was secretly responsible for them. <i>I</i> wasn't throwing an owl at them when they were weak -- there was always an owl there, and if that roll went that way, they'd have to face that owl, and being weak at that time would be a consequence of previous decisions that they made -- it wasn't <i>me</i> doing it to the <i>players</i>, it was the Mouse Territories doing it to the patrol. So I think it would depend on how it would subjectively feel to do this, and whether it would feel like I was finding excuses to screw around with their difficulty numbers, or if it felt more like a fair-minded interpretation of the fiction or the requirements of the rules (or maybe some other subjective feeling I haven't considered).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333446/#Comment_333446" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T04:58:35+00:00" title="July  7, 2011  4:58AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) Rather than students using time to increse the width of the difficulty they use effort. <br/>2) Time gets removed entirely. <br/>3) Students can also use effort to bring in positive resources. <br/>4) When the GM wants to bring in a negitive resource he has to get the ok from the student who has the negitive resource by offering them a point of effort. <br/><br/>Question: Would this make you feel better about bringing in negitive resources?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333534/#Comment_333534" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T15:54:07+00:00" title="July  7, 2011  3:54PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JBMannon</cite>4) When the GM wants to bring in a negitive resource he has to get the ok from the student who has the negitive resource by offering them a point of effort.<br/><br/>Question: Would this make you feel better about bringing in negitive resources?</blockquote>\nProbably, although the way you're describing it here makes it seem highly focused on a transaction between the player and GM which might make things seem adversarial. I'm also a little bit concerned that the "negatives" are now mostly GM authored and this mechanic incentivizes them to bring their creations in repeatedly, so it might lead to a bit of a disconnect in play. Personally, I'm not I huge fan of "trait economy" style of game design as you see in games like FATE since I feel the point acquisition/spending tend to flatten things out rather than making them engaging, so I'm not excited to see "effort" possibly going in that direction, but that may be an issue of personal preference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333553/#Comment_333553" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T17:35:50+00:00" title="July  7, 2011  5:35PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel it trending into a FATE-ish direction as well.

Can they lose? Are there degrees of success on a given year other than whether or not you pass you classes? I know some (or all) of this may be addressed in the text, but none of the answers have stuck in my mind, and I've read it twice and perused it while playing a session.<br/><br/>The reason I ask is that it makes more sense to me for the GM to spend "his" traits to bring in the adversity per scene. He has this fixed amount of Mystery and Struggle that he can choose to save tell the end (in the case of struggle) or keep at a distance (Mystery) or he can risk losing them in the short term (now, in this scene) to make it more likely that the characters fail at their intended goal. This could have three possible uses:<br/><br/>- A tool to control pacing.<br/>- A way to communicate when something is or isn't a red herring. The GM can make a scene really hard, or bring in a lot of elements, if it begins way off track like it did with our scene.<br/>- A tactical point allocation thing, if it is at all possible for the GM to play to win.<br/><br/>Personally I would the GM to have some clear cut goal that he could use as a guide to determine where in when it would be appropriate to push against the students. In-story logic is a great jumping off point, but not an end point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333846/#Comment_333846" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T08:49:41+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  8:49AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok so to your question, no, there is no way for the players to fail completely at a given year.

In one sense I'm glad that we're doing it wrong, because I think we've been frustrating each other quite a bit, but I'm not really excited about the prospect of injecting more consensus or unwritten "this is the way GM's and players traditionally interact" rules into the mix.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338513/#Comment_338513" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T17:27:15+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  5:27PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Leo, Nolan, and I played another session and I released it as <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/podcast/2011/08/12/episode-32-boarsdraft-playtest-1c/" rel="nofollow">episode 32</a> of the <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/podcast" rel="nofollow">Designer vs. Reality</a> podcast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341571/#Comment_341571" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-04T20:40:55+00:00" title="September  4, 2011  8:40PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted our fourth playtest session as <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/podcast/2011/09/05/episode-33-boarsdraft-playtest-1d/" rel="nofollow">episode 33</a> of the <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/podcast" rel="nofollow">Designer vs. Reality</a> podcast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341843/#Comment_341843" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-07T10:56:14+00:00" title="September  7, 2011 10:56AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And now the fifth and final session is up as <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/podcast/2011/09/07/episode-34-boarsdraft-playtest-1e/" rel="nofollow">episode 34</a>.<br/><br/>Overall I had a really positive experience with Boarsdraft. We has some issues with the game, most notably with the pacing mechanics, dice mechanics, and scene framing, but the good far outweighed the bad. I think the core of the game (especially the way the Mystery and Red Herrings are supposed to work) delivers some great insight into how to get an actual Harry Potter feel out of a game. Plus, I had a ton of fun as a GM creating the almost-but-not-quite Harry Potter background details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
