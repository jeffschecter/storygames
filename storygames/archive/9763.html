Has anyone read the endgame rules?<br/>Before the Master Villain's Immunity lifts, the table needs to Dot The Sun three times and unlock two of the Master Auras.<br/>Dotting the Sun once takes between 5 and 7 sessions.<br/>To Dot the Sun three times AND unlock two Master Auras would take roughly 20 sessions.<br/>And yet Brilliant Aura calls itself a "pick up and play game".<br/>No one would play this shit for 20 sessions. TOTALLY BROKEN.<br/><br/>Also, most of the listed skills are completely irrelevant to both supers and the whole faux-Exalted vibe.<br/>Accounting? Academics?

It came from the "garage band" school of naming, where you take two random words and stick them together.  <br/><br/>If that weren't bad enough, the game itself is unreadable.  It's typeset in one of those oh-so-hip faux typewriter fonts, but it just looks like it was typed on a crappy manual typewriter.  <br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the system.  It's like the stats, skills, and resolution systems were written by different people who weren't even looking at what one another were doing.  For crying out loud, I couldn't even figure out whether I'm supposed to roll low or high.  (It took me three times through the book before I realized "8d4" meant roll <i>four eight-sided dice</i>.)  <br/><br/>The setting?  You play coked-up meth heads whose sole purpose in life is to go around and break things.  The game throws around the words "fuck" and "shit" a lot, trying to be all ironic and post-modern, but given the general tone it comes off sounding.... amateurish.  Like five year olds trying to creatively misspell words they don't know how to spell in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216799/#Comment_216799" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T21:27:43+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  9:27PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2009 9:35PM by PaulCzege.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate <i><b>Savior</b></i> with a mad, burning passion.

I don't know who designed it; it says "Walt Disney" on the cover.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a first skim of the rules, it all seemed nice enough - lots of little things like how to set up the room for perfect play, how to introduce players to each other, ritual phrases of courtesy etc. I gathered some friends in the old tree-house, and gave them the handouts. Everyone was smiling as they read their lines out loud.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a few minutes, I introduced the Joyful rule, as per the instructions. Happiness increased in the room; we could almost feel it physically in the air. It was as if the sun had come up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player on my right, Erika, one of my childhood friends, was the first to understand the Conundrum Option. I'd thought the procedure was pointless, but as she started playing it hard, I started seeing how it worked. And that's when it clicked.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all looked at each other and <i>understood the game</i>. At the same time, we understood we couldn't put it down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know why I was the first to take action. But I knew we were locked in the game. Some emergent property, some strange interreaction of procedures and rules that we hadn't foreseen, was choking us with its clammy hands.I reached out and picked up the fork. I knew - we <i>all</i> knew - that there was only one way to get out. I didn't really feel anything as I pierced Erika's eye, nothing but desperation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there was the sharp pain as someone bit my leg. It wasn't one of the players. It was some neighborhood kid. He'd been hiding in the garden outside the treehouse, listening to the game, and got caught in its spell. My blood was running, warm, I could smell it. Dripping on the floor of the tree house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't want to talk in detail about what happened. The night was long, long. In the morning, I climbed down from the tree house, exhausted. Hanging by the only arm I had left.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to warn you all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Friendship Game</b> is broken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216825/#Comment_216825" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T03:13:30+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  3:13AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That Disney, stealing the name of my game! ;-)<br><br>I love this thread, someone had been reading Borges?<br><br>I hate the most awful game God had ever created, he called it "<b>March of the Ants</b>".

It's based on Hesse's novel, so I was all hyped up about it, but that's where the excitement ended. <br/><br/>First of all, the setting is crazy. Instead of just using Europe, they made up some pseudo-Europe bullshit "Castalia" setting with the serial numbers filed off. But then, instead of giving me cool details about the setting, it just lists other resources I need to read: novels, magazines, albums, movies, textbooks. Great. For my $20, I expected a complete book!<br/><br/>But where it really falls down is the rules. There are mechanics strewn about the "setting" section -- or at least allusions to the mechanics -- but nothing really solid. I can't figure out how actually to play this thing!  The game plays out on a giant relationship map, I think, but it seems you're not supposed to write it down. The rules say that the truth is expressed in music. You connect all kinds of weird cultural and scientific ideas together. The mechanism isn't clear, and I have no idea how the bead currency works. Apparently, to be able to play it well, you need advanced training in mathematics, too. <br/><br/>The book ends kind of abruptly. It's like the designer got bored with it before he finished. I'd say it is incomplete but it was already too hard to understand, so I dunno.  Oh, also, I think calling the GM the "Magister Ludi" was a really dumb idea.<br/><br/>I spent $20 for the damned PDF, and I can't even figure out how to play it, so I totally feel robbed.

The age old theme of an uprising of plush animals against their human oppressors has long been a passion of mine. The cover was evocative as well, showing a partially damaged Teddy Ruxpin (The Gwar cassette tape in his chest was a nice touch) defending a group of Cabbage patch dolls, his little bear arms holding a can of Raid and a lit match.  <br/><br/>The Full Felt edition comes with a sewing kit to add "Battle Damage" to your characters, which is a cost saving measure.  However, problems began to crop up during character creation.  <br/><br/>First of all, I'm not comfortable with the first step, to "liberate a fabricated American (FA from here on in) from the cruel child overseers". My two year old nephew put up quite a fight, and I still have bruises from where he head butted me.  <br/><br/>Once you have your FA liberated, you have to cast off it's slave name and take up a new one.  This is done using a bag of letters from a Scrabble set.  You can only draw five times, so Binoo was reborn as XLGRU .  The value of the letters in your FA's name are the number of traits your FA has.<br/><br/>Now, the idea of adding additional traits to the FA is to literally sew on pieces of felt, glue on googly eyes, as well as glitter and paint. The problem is that the rules don't give you any kind of limit on where you can sew on these traits.  I ended up covering my plush cat with felt, googly eyes, glitter, and bright orange paint, which turned him into some sort of Cthulhu disco dancer. <br/><br/>From here, play begins. And here's where the mechanics get in the way.  Combining the Tarot with an Uno Deck may sound like a good idea on paper, but in practice it creates insanity.  When I drew a "Reverse" and "the Tower" I was able to shatter an M1A1 Abrahms Tank with XLGRU's felt screwdriver.  What kind of balancing is that?<br/><br/>Now, battle damage is completely broken. Considering the material composition of most stuffed animals, burning off the pieces with a butane torch just didn't fit our playstyle.  There are alternate rules involving a bandsaw that we ended up using, and it did make the staplegun healing mechanic a lot easier.<br/><br/>The endgame mechanic involves filling the insides of our FA with fireworks and setting it off, signifying their final act of defiance against the human oppressors.  We hadn't read far enough ahead to realize that we could gather pieces of our FA afterward to sew onto our new FAs for the next game, but really, there wasn't going to be a next game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216907/#Comment_216907" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T09:23:27+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  9:23AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2009 9:16PM by Johnstone.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, we used to play this game <b>Grosvenor Meat Market.</b> Holy fuck.<br/><br/>I dropped out mostly because of the endless rules arguments. The book was translated into English from... some language with umlauts... in about a week, and it's a 200+ page book, so lots of phrases make no sense at all. Even the mathematical formulas for stat+skill etc etc are bonkers.<br/><br/>The rules are pretty bog-standard trad gaming, except for a few things. One stat is called "Pretense" and we never could figure out what it was supposed to do. You have to keep track of your income and your meat stock, which is referred to both as physical inventory and y'know, stock in a company. You can trade these around to influence your rolls or to influence customers of the meat market, but how this worked in actual practice was that it usually provoked a shouting match between players claiming to know what the crazy Ingrish text <i>really</i> means.<br/><br/>As if leaving the scope of task or conflict resolution undefined wasn't bad enough, there's also the setting. Now, I'm no expert on New England, but I've been there once and I know which side of the US it's on - unlike the authors of GMM, apparently, who describe 19th century Boston as some tasteless combination of the bad parts of San Francisco and Chicago.<br/><br/>Yeah, well.

We were playing Grosvenor Meat Market and we had this hour-long discussion about Rule Zero. Most of us players liked it, because we wanted the GM to tell us a story and entertain us so we could really steep ourselves in the atmosphere of the fictional Boston the game is set in.

You can cross-index the stat+skill with the Butcher Number and find the precalculated target. Just roll d120 against that and if you roll under the number but not over your Pretense*4, you succeed! So easy. I put sticky tabs on the first page of each chart so I can find the right chart according to Meat Type (pork, beef, poultry, game, etc.) at a moment's notice.</blockquote>\nOh, <i>the chart.</i> Yeah. So first off, it doesn't match the formulas, and second, it's a bell-curve! wtf? My stats get better so things get harder again? And does that meat chart really need separate entries for pork, ham, hog, sausage, pig, bacon, and boar?

How I was mistaken.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing that I noticed is that the first fifteen or so pages of the text rigorously detailed the interests and backgrounds of five grad students at the University of Nanterre. At first, I thought maybe it was like fluff fiction or like an example of a party but no, it seemed to be the actual lives of the authors of the game. Weird, I know. Then the second chapter titled \u201cPraxio-Phenomenal Embodiment: An Introduction and Notes Toward a Holistic and Critical Understanding of Immigrant Disabled Lebanese Lesbian Transvestites in the Great Toronto Area; a Memoir\u201d started stating characters with both Greek and German terms. I mean, sure, Ousia or Techne may not be as intuitive as dexterity but I figure most people can see what they\u2019re getting at. But Dasien was somewhat ambiguous. However, the footnote explaining and justifying that these concepts will be co-constituted/embodied during practice and furthermore that quantitative mechanics where indicative of hegemonic, patriarchal and positivist epistemologies started taking up more than two-thirds of the pages I started to wonder if this was the game for me. At around page 214, the main body text seems to split into columns wherein the text starts to argue with itself. After ninety or so pages of this the whole section on what I presume to be character creation abruptly stops.<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider myself a man who both enjoys, nay, loves skill-lists, spell-lists, feat-lists, lists of any kind in a game. They calm my taxed nerves after having to come up with things like name. But this was too much. I think \u201cskill-list\u201d here would be a too generous term; perhaps \u201cactivity-list.\u201d Every conceivable skill was broken into component parts. For example, Scrap-Booking was not just one entry but several: glue-gunnery, photo-scavengery, &amp;c.; These seem to all interact with other entries, like Collage and Scissor proficiency, in arcane ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe core mechanic seems to boil down to talking over the other players in using ritual phrases and referring to your splats\u2019 (here called \u2018paradigm\u2019) power. There were not clear rules on how the various power interacted. I mean, could a Marxist take a Feminist? Did it depend on tenure or species? The rules were mum. There was a splat that was "after" splats and they seemed to have some sort of mysterious edge.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat follows appear to be some meteorological or geological charts of Southern France. Maybe. The printing wasn\u2019t very good so I can\u2019t really read the font. These are covered with all sorts of symbols which I assume to be trade routes. Maybe highways. What I can tell you is that this is followed by meticulous descriptions of thirty-five French sounding towns\u2019 economic activity. What relevance this section has I don\u2019t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis section is dove-tailed with what seems to be a list of supplements published by either the authors or the same publisher; maybe recommended reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not recommend this product to a friend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217127/#Comment_217127" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-08T01:07:11+00:00" title="July  8, 2009  1:07AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2009 1:07AM by GB_Steve.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We LARPed Grosvenor Meat Market. Man, I still can't get the bloodstains out of my jeans and in the end we just had to throw the cows away. But what do you do with a ton of beef that's been sitting round a warm scout hut for 6 hours? You don't want to know. Maybe Jeepform is a better approach.<br><br>The game we had problems with was <b>\u0447\u0445\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\u043a!</b>. It's difficult to know where to begin. We had a Russian/English dictionary but given that it was a pdf, Google was easier to use. I'm afraid we didn't get much beyond the title which means "Chhalny Powder!". Yeah, I know, we didn't have a clue either. And there was no cover as such, nor much internal art. On page 6, there was a picture of a small metal box with some powder in it, probably chhalny powder. On page 20, there's this watermark that's difficult to make out behind the text. We eventually realised it was "\u0412\u043e\u0434\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a" which translates as watermark, although this phrase also occured fifteen times in the rules so I suspect there's some subtext we're not getting. In the middle pages there's a pull out section, it's a great long list of things with number next to them. This might be an index, or it could be a price list. There's an illustration of some kind of medical equipment on page 4 but it doesn't look like you'd want to use it on a person. Finally, the character sheet is rather sparse, there's a space for name and photograph and several circles, a bit like those on the Mortal Coil character sheet. They're labelled, in Russian, Snus, Toast and Moist. We have no idea what these are for.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217130/#Comment_217130" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-08T01:39:37+00:00" title="July  8, 2009  1:39AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Side note: This thread reminds me of an old series of SF short stories.

The reviews I had read hinted at some satirical alt-history game about XVIIIth century English political factions. The premise was "What if Charles James Fox had an affair that turned sour with William Pitt the Younger? I thought : what if history and cheap jokes about British sexual orientations ? What's not to love? I was deeply disappointed when I actually read the core book (after a 4 months delay for delivery!) The game is really about couples who struggles with Rosetta Stone install DVDs and how their whimsy computer turn their world upside down by deciding to wear a wig because it's ashamed of its baldness. I mean, ok I can enjoy deep exploration of Luddite society transposed into a contemporary setting but I didn't pay for that. Anyway, even if I could overcome the bait and switch (I realized later I had mistyped the game name when searching on rpgnet *sigh*) there's no way I could play a game where the number of players has to be exactly 6 and even worse it has to be 3 women and 3 men. I have no time in my agenda for this shit! Rituals based on non sequiturs and poems could be compelling but the implementation is terrible. The final straw that bent the camel's back backward was when I realized they included some kind of metaplot where two of the PC couples are interchangeable. It's supposed to be a reveal at the end of the last game session (could take up to 10 sessions I believe). Considering there's no GM to provide the reveal they suggest that you order a VHS for $70 that allegedly brings the best possible conclusion (Leibnitz\xa9) to the campaign. Fuck that noise!

Sure, I'm all for the reclamation of the food industry from the factory farm regime, sustainable alternatives, love the hearth, blah blah blah. . .but this game just does not give you the tools to GM it. I mean seriously, there are no stats for pesticides, no material strength indexes for common farm fortifications. . .not even so much as a difficulty factor for chicken coop padlocks! And don't get me started on the superpowers. Each power is a single-line description. That's IT. No guidelines on movement speeds, damage dealt, or relative potency vs. different Agricultural Agent types.WHAT THE FUCK? I know, I know, this whole game is supposed to be an exercise in the inevitability of agricultural collapse, but at least give me the tools to challenge my players a LITTLE bit.

I tried it with some friends last weekend. Let me say in my understated way that it SUCKED ASS.<br/><br/>It's a generic, super-light rules system. Everything resolves around a single roll. There is one stat, Goodness, rated 1-3. In conflicts, you roll d20 and add your Goodness and compare it to the opposition's d20 + Goodness roll. High roll wins. <br/><br/>That last paragraph? That's the rules. I don't mean I paraphrased them. I mean it's a direct quote. I understand some people like systems that get out of the way, but this is ridonkulous. I couldn't figure out what to do with this. I mean, the character's Goodness hardly influences the roll at all. I might as well just be flipping a coin at this point. <br/><br/>I'm never playing SIMple SIMon again.

Sweet sweet wuxia action I thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nI pictured it as maybe being something like PCs are doing Iron Chef like competitions, only they have to duel other chefs to get ingredients, deal with their mixed loyalties to each other, the desire to win versus maintaining their honor, describing beautiful colors of the food as it cooks and the area that they're cooking in, serving the dish to the randomly chosen customer and convincing them to try it and of course... hardcore wushu smackdown against not just the other rival cooks, but delivery food driver mooks, Applebees management types secretly sponsoring cooks and trying to rig the win, maybe even some sort of drug-company hit squads that have been dispatched because the cooking competition has stumbled onto various cures for some ailment or another over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, what do I get?<br/>\n<br/>\nChartmaster 17000. You roll to start your "career". Just about every single one of them sucks, being some variation of "fry cook" or "supermarket sushi chef". Not that anything is wrong with that in and of itself; I've had more than a few inglorious jobs myself. It's just... wow... international wushu/kungfu chef that started out working the DriveThru of Burger King? Really?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was willing to let it slide. Until I discovered the usual "fun" of a lifepath system... getting your character rendered non-viable while still making the little bastard. It's amusing if it happens once or maybe even twice... but it shouldn't take me 9 <a href="/forums/profile/%23%24%25%23">@#$%#</a><a href="/forums/profile/%24%25%23%24">@$%#$</a> tries just to get to "wushu initiate cook". I mean, ok...slipped in the walk-in freezer while having sex and had hands crushed by frozen chicken... amusing. Eyes lost due to towel snapping fight...I haven't seen a single eye lost, let alone both, but..still a giggle. Accidentally locked in the freezer? Fingers lost in tomato cutter accident? Groin shot by 80 year old vegan protester that's making a stand for animal rights? Bit by a presumed rat (actually a prairie dog) and dying of Bubonic Plague? WTF?!?!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's _5_, count them _5_ levels of this crap. "The Call", "Initiate", "Proving", "No matter what", "Graduation". "No matter what" is just.. c'mon guys, it might be a standard trope in some 80's action movie, but... at least make an effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Lifepath (called "Career") wraps all the skills, recipes, special ingredients, cooking moves, wushu techniques, and environments, into the usual smorgasbord of nonsensical combinations. For example, did you realize you get "knife" technique points _only_ from the 6 soup paths? Yup. Apparently, a chef _only_ uses a knife when making soup. Tea ceremony is where you pick up the Frozen Fist throwing technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could deal with all of this, except when it comes to conflict. It's an unholy nightmare. They do this scripting thing, which is done every so often in rpgs. It can work, but Cook God slips and falls down hard. First, you roll a contest to see if you get the Environment that you want. Then, you have to script out a mix of Ingredients, Cooking Moves, Wushu Techniques and Recipes. Depending on the order you set it up, you might wind up actually cooking something, getting into a fight, stealing one of the 4 scripted moves from an opponent and adding it to your current Cook-Off contest (not a permanent addition though, just for this particular Cook-Off) or simply Botching. How do you Botch? No clue; apparently, they managed to forget to actually explain that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, take all that and multiply it x5. Or however many people you've got in your group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose 36 (!) different cooking skills? Completely worthless. Charmaster 17000 renders it into a deeply stacked Rock, Paper, Scissors thing. The equipment list? A whole _other_ nightmare. It's like gun-porn, only for chefs. While it might matter desperately to someone, I for one don't give a crap whether my timer is a sand, dial, or electronic. I really freaking don't. Likewise, I don't see the need for 15 different paring knives. Especially if you're only going to offer 3 bread knifes. I mean... who the hell thinks this stuff up? Would the game have broken if it'd only had... oh, say 7 paring knives and maybe 5 bread knives? What about the sharpeners?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get laundry list after laundry list of crap like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GMing advice is worthless. "Encourage your players to be creative in their descriptions." I almost started slamming the book on the table I was so pissed. How much more generic can you get? What's even the point of being "creative" when they're spending all their !$%<a href="/forums/profile/%23%24%25">@#$%</a><a href="/forums/profile/%23%24">@#$</a> time rolling on the stupid @!#$%<a href="/forums/profile/%23%24%25">@#$%</a> chart after they've spent 2 hours staring at the equipment lists? It's not like being "creative" actually matters one whit, and considering how long it takes to script the Cook-Off, I'm not sure I really want the player to say anything more than "I chop" anyway. I'm not even going to discuss the advice given to GMs for "entertaining" mishaps when a character Botches.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lack of an index is just salt in the wound of your lost eye from the chip that flew into it from your cutting board (one of the "entertaining" Botch results).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I've sufficiently described my hatred of the game and why the broken rules suck. I'm pretty sure I hate this game forever. I mean, "Heavenly Razor Carrot Fan Technique"? I can accept the whole flinging wasabi powder into someone's eyes to blind them and all, but some things are just...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217710/#Comment_217710" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-10T14:37:53+00:00" title="July 10, 2009  2:37PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher Fletcher,<br><br>I can see why you'd hate that game forever!
