At the moment, all the characters have Neuroses (e.g. "Must wash his hands after touching strangers"), which are lovely character pointers, but don't affect the game much.<br/><br/>Now, I've just been reading Emily's playtest draft of Sign In Stranger, and it's giving me ideas of how to fix this. In particular, it has things <i>like</i> Neuroses, but which actually affect the game.<br/><br/>I particularly like the way that, in SiS, a character sometimes gets overwhelmed by the alienness of their environment. And they basically run round, waving their arms, going "Aaaargh! Aaaargh!". (I paraphrase).<br/><br/>Similarly, I'm thinking that Gay Recruitment Squad Members should sometimes, if they lose a challenge and get scared, spend a turn going "Oh my God! Oh my God!" and flapping their hands until another Squad Member rescues them. That should be an attribute of the character:\n<blockquote>Panic Attack: Flaps hands and goes "Oh my God! Oh my God!"</blockquote>\nAnd maybe they should have a similar reaction to their seduction attempts being rejected.\n<blockquote>Rejection Reaction: Gets blind drunk and pours heart out to strangers.</blockquote>\nAnd then you should have relationships between Squad Members. They're in Sign In Stranger too. That strikes me as a way to have something <i>like</i> Neuroses, but which point towards the other Squad Members in some way.<br/><br/>I don't know. How does this sound? Help me kick ideas around.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66992/#Comment_66992" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-05T18:56:14+00:00" title="May  5, 2007  6:56PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't the Graham Axiom, steal from ECB?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>"Oh my God!

What about a random target gets the attention from the neurotic character? And gains an advantage if he can calm the neurotic character down?<br/><br/>Like: "There, there, little one. It's going to be okay."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
