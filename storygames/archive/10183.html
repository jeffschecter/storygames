I have like many of you been working on a game and am now looking for people interested in Playing it. <br/><br/>The Catch is I need feedback, and Want Cold Start (ie you receive the text as is, with no additional notes or hints on how to make it happen) experiences .<br/><br/>If you interested, you can post here (I am also cross posting this at various other sites if you think your cred will be damaged for showing interest in a lowly playtest and want to post you acclaim somewhere else feel free.) or you may email me at mackay.joshua@gmail.com. The Game document wont be ready for a few weeks (trust me its time well spent) and while the aim is to make it readable and playable obviously, I'm not sweating the layout at this point in time. <br/><br/>The Game itself is a modular attempt at a space opera/firefly type game. It uses d6's and pools of dice and successes and what not. Play testers/groups interested in multiple sessions/etc are especially welcome. This is of course Pro- Bono or Pro Funno as I like to call it. <br/><br/>To recap. <br/><br/>Need Playtests for a Cold Read<br/>Sign up here or at Mackay.joshua@gmail.com<br/>Game is a firefly type game. <br/><br/>Thanks again                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
