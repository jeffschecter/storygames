                    James Mullen and I got to Conception on Wednesday afternoon, and bumped into Rich Stokes shortly after the first block of games had started.  We were all at something of a loose end, so I suggested a quick game of Dogs in the Vineyard until the evening games.  Rich had never played Dogs before, and James had only played once, so character generation was a must.  The only town I had on me that was light enough to allow us to create characters and finish the game in the time we had was Bountiful, the first I'd ever written and one I'd never been that happy with.  Given the players, I shouldn't have worried!<br/><br/>James created Brother Jackson, a very hard-nosed and literal Dog with a thirst for justice.  Rich played Brother Virgil, a more compassionate sort and the perfect foil for Jackson.<br/><br/>I'll summarise the bulk of the game, as it's the ending I really want to focus on.  On their way into town, the Dogs met a young man, Brother Atticus, who asked them if they were here to remove the branch steward.  Atticus claimed that the steward had killed his sister, Sister Naomi, and that no one would stand up to him.  He said that he could even hear Naomi's death screams coming from the house at night.<br/><br/>The Dogs promised to investigate and went on to the steward's house, where they met Brother Cornelius, the steward, and his wife, Sister Hester.  Cornelius had taken Naomi as his second wife a year ago, but told the Dogs that she had died of a snake bite a few years ago.  <br/><br/>A lot of other stuff happened as they travelled around town, including getting a philandering blacksmith to see the error of his ways and finding evidence of demonic activity driving a wedge between the young and old.  They met Atticus again, who accused them of a whitewash and threatened to kill Cornelius by the end of the day if they didn't find justice for his sister.  Interestingly, they let him get away with this, taking his threat as a deadline by which the situation had to be resolved.  I assume this was because they were afraid of having to kill him to stop him, which was cool.<br/><br/>Eventually they headed back to the branch steward, hurrying once they heard screams coming from his house.  Finding no natural causes, they decided to call up the spirit of Sister Naomi and hear her side of things.  This is where things got really interesting.<br/><br/>After watching a replay of Naomi's last moments, where she staggered out of the woodshed after drinking a bottle of turpentine, vomiting blood and screaming before falling to the floor, they started to interrogate her.  It quickly transpired that Naomi had killed herself out of guilt after conducting a sexual relationship with Sister Hester (who had told her that Naomi had married her as well as Cornelius).<br/><br/>Brother Virgil decided to help Naomi pass over peaceful, but Jackson was having none of this.  James and Rich then kicked off the most interesting conflict I've seen in DitV.  The two of them started arguing over whether Naomi's sins could be forgiven, or whether she should spend eternity paying for them.  This quickly escalated to a battle of spiritual wills and Virgil tried to absolve her while Jackson was busy damning her.  As Virgil started losing, he resorted to violence, raising his hand against a fellow Dog rather than let a girl he saw as innocent be damned.  They wrestled, threw punched, fought with religious symbols and even drew guns on each other.  Finally, though, Jackson prevailed and Naomi was cast into eternal torment.<br/><br/>Maddened by this, Virgil turned around and shot Hester in the head.<br/><br/>The Dogs both ended up taking fallout, which took the form of relationships with each other, reflecting fear and lack of trust.<br/><br/>The final resolution was that they removed Cornelius as branch steward (he was a broken man by this stage anyway) and replaced him with the blacksmith, whose genuine repentance had touched them both.  They also told Atticus that they had brought justice to his sister, and then told him what that meant, almost destroying him.  They took him back to Bridal Falls, wondering whether he was too old to start training as a Dog.<br/><br/>This session just blew me away.  I've seen Dogs (and their players!) argue about moral choices before, but never this intensely.  It was entirely good-natured on the part of the players, but neither they nor their characters wanted to give an inch, seeing the fate of this girl's soul as the most important thing in the world.  For what was at heart a religious debate, it left me feeling drained, moved and thoroughly impressed with the players and the power of this game.                </div>

                            Great AP. <br/><br/>Funny enough, one of the most intense Dog vs Dogs conflicts I've seen (that wasn't Bitches) involved another dog named Brother Jackson, and the struggle over who got to shoot his mother in the face. <br/><br/>Always fun, that one.                        </div>

                            Nice. It does make me wonder (as this often does when it appears in Dogs AP) if 'taking NPC X Off To Become A Dog' isn't one of the most interesting tropes of DitV. On the one hand it seems like some kind of Get Out Of Community Compromise Card, and on the other hand you look at the people that groups decide would make good Dogs and wonder what that said about how they see the role.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I think they saw more than a little of Brother Jackson in Atticus.  His single-minded determination to see what he thought was the right thing done, even if it meant killing the man tasked with holding the community together, must have struck a chord.<br/><br/>The other thing that's struck me about this town is that all three times I've run it Sister Hester has been killed by the Dogs.  I've explained that the players are responsible for deciding what's right and wrong in a given situation, even if it means contradicting the word of the law.  I've also made it clear that any relationship between Naomi and Hester was consensual, but that Naomi killed herself because of her inability to reconcile the relationship with her faith.  Every time, though, the Dogs have decided that Hester was responsible for Naomi's death and needed to pay with her life.  Considering the flexibility I've seen from the players in other towns, the consistency of this surprises me.                        </div>

                            This was a totally awesome game.<br/><br/>The thing with Sister Naomi worked something like this in my view:<br/><br/>Virgil's whole character is based on one simple concept: The Word is not the be-all-and-end-all.  It's not that The Word is ever wrong, it's just that people need to do their own thing while obeying The Word, and that's what life's all about.  Crops will not grow if all you do is pray all day, you need to tend the fields too.  The more wisely you tend to the fields, the better your crops grow.  Therefore, God likes it when you apply your own wisdom to life and still obey the Word.<br/><br/>So, compared to Brother Jackson (who's attitude is very black and white, "You are a sinner, go to hell!!!!"), Brother Virgil is all about compassion and shades of grey.<br/><br/>The logic of what went down was pretty simple to Brother Virgil.  Sister Naomi was clearly coerced into sex with Sister Hester.  If she wasn't coerced, she wouldn't have felt guilty enough about it to kill herself.  Therefore, as the victim of coercion, she wasn't the sinner.  So everything rested on Sister Hester's shoulders, including Sister Naomi's suicide.<br/><br/>Flawed logic aside (and lets face it, flawed logic leads to much more interesting conflicts than sound logic), it was pretty obvious that Virgil and Johnson were going to disagree on this.<br/><br/>Also, it was James who escalated both times.  That why I took fallout of losing my Book Of Life after he batted it our of my hand and into the abyss of hell...                        </div>

                            Yes, it was indeed my PC who escalated, not Brother Virgil, and the cool thing there was when Brother Jackson knocked the Book of Life out of Brother Virgil's hands with his gun! Part of my fallout was expressed as a need to for absolution, in that, in the course of doing what he truly believed the King of Life would have wanted, he had to disrespect the physical embodiment of the King's Will on Earth, i.e. the Book. It really was edge of seat stuff as Rich &amp; I reached for every last Trait and item we had in order to hold our ground; if we'd had banjo's, we would probably have duelled against each other with gospel music!<br/>
My own personal motivation for going for the "Damn her to Hell!" attitude was just, at that moment, it suddenly struck me how cool that would be. In my previous game, everyone was very forgiving of the Goodies and very ready to condemn the Baddies, so I just decided to try something contrary to my own nature. Glad I did; it was a wicked conflict!                        </div>
