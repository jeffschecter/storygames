You get the first track free. If you share that with 20 friends (or, rather, if the track propagates 20 times through the website), you get the second. And so on.<br/><br/>We don't make much use of things like this. I've seen John Wick selling very cheap PDFs, to stimulate play, and presumably people buying the full book. There's also ransom models.But, given the range of techniques available, we're using very few of them.<br/><br/>What techniques, like this, could we use to sell games? What techniques have you seen used elsewhere, to sell things which aren't games, that we could steal?<br/><br/>No essays, please, but short, thoughtful posts very welcome.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Yokomizo" title="Daniel Yokomizo"><img alt="Daniel Yokomizo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Yokomizo">Daniel Yokomizo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189320/#Comment_189320" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T08:24:00+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  8:24AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2009 8:24AM by Daniel Yokomizo.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.
