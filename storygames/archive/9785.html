Eric dropped out after the initial conflict. I think the amount of fake science we were throwing around was too much for his tired state. And Richard, who loves the gonzo like no one else, was mentally overwhelmed right before the final conflict, but managed to pull through somehow.  Honestly, I think this says a lot of things (mostly good) about the game.<br/><br/>While we started out trying for that 1950s vibe, by the end it was clear that we were doing the cartoon remake made around the same time as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Centurions_(TV_series)" rel="nofollow">Centurions</a> (POWER EXTREME!) or some of the mid-1980s Johnny Quest.<br/><br/>The characters were:<br/><br/>Dr. Franklin Rocketsled (inventor of the rocketsled, the predecessor to rocket cars), a Two-Fisted Professor<br/>Bruce Target, an Atomic Commando<br/>Kladug A (sp?), an Alien Warrior<br/>Spam Slade, a Robot Detective<br/>Mel Bloodbane, a Mystic Flyboy<br/>Malius Mindbender, a Psychic Agent<br/><br/>We started with the Crimson Ape fight which went fine.  I added a couple more apes due to the number of characters (6) and it lasted almost 2 rounds.  Has anyone ever had the traffic overload actually be a problem?  Seems like you could put a 2 counter on it instead of 3 and it would be fine.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the players ignored their special role-based equipment for the entire game.  Not sure how they did that.  I guess we just never talked about it, so they just used their rocketpacks and wrist communicators for bonus dice.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can describe the plot in a way that makes any sense at all, which may be a problem for anyone trying to write AP about Danger Patrol.  <br/><br/>The Patrol interrogated the zookeeper boy responsible for the apes and found that he had been mind-controlled with mystic / atomic powers.  Dr. Rocketsled suspected that this might be the doing of a criminal mastermind they had encountered before, so for the second encounter I had them confront Baron Von Bombastic in his hypercube prison orbiting around Titan. The Patrol flew to Titan in their rocketship shaped like a giant snake (which April cut out from paper).  Of course, Von Bombastic had used his powers of "atomic magnetism" to mesmerize his space police guards and conduct a massive secret infiltration across the entire solar system, from the merchant-industrialists of Millenium Tower (featured in a Last Time On...) to the lowliest zookeepers.<br/><br/>Then there was a fight. The snake ship got gradually pulled into the hypercube, but Dr. Rocketsled hacked into the hypercube control mechanism, turning it into an "atomic icosohedron" and threatening to tear both the ship and the prison apart. Mel grabbed the top half of Von Bombastic, but the morphing of space ripped his legs off, leaving him half a man but otherwise unharmed, sustained as he was by his atomic magnetism. The hyper-icosahedron now seemed posed to explode, but eventually the patrol mastered the situation and escape with half of the supervillain, having been informed of his plans.  At the same time, Dr. Rocketsled recognized some of his own work in the coding of the hypercube prison and was determined to find out how his research had been stolen.<br/><br/>Spam Slade contacted Mr. Hoover of the Space Bureau of Investigation and informed him that the Space Police had been deeply corrupted by the atomic mesmerism of Von Bombastic and that there was a greater plot afoot.  In fact, Dr. Rocketsled discovered that the hypercube prisons were being made cheaply by Chinese knock-off factories and were perhaps even intentionally manufactured with flaws, so that -- at the right moment -- they would all fail, releasing a slew of criminal masterminds from their orbital prisons.  Following these leads led the patrol to a final confrontation beneath the seas of Neptune, where they discovered an undersea Nth-dimentional hyperstorm while traveling in their squid-shaped ship (another of April's inventions).<br/><br/>A Nth-dimentional entitly poked it's tentacles out of the storm and began wrestling with the ship, but Bruce Target blew up a nearby patch of sea anemones to reveal the true architect of all these masterminds' release -- the hyper-mastermind if you will -- was none other than Malius Mindbender himself, a member of the Danger Patrol, who was lurking nearby in his bubble-shaped ship (Eric had dropped out after the opening, so I just grabbed his character and kept going).  While attempting to fight the tentacles, the dimentional storm, and Malius all at the same time, Spam Slade rolled 5 Danger, so I announced that Malius' plot to release the masterminds was about to become true unless Spam took a hit and tried to prevent it from occuring.  He took the hit and then used his action to help Bruce (the Atomic Commando) shoot through the Nth dimensional storm <i>into the past</i> and kill all the agents of Malius who were preparing to release the super-villains.  Malius ultimately had his life energy drained from him by the alien patrolman, but the episode ended with Spam and Bruce stuck in the past, Mel and Dr. Rocketsled being pulled back to the 5th dimension by the tentacled entity, and the alien left alone in the seas of Neptune as the dimension storm swelled to engulf the entire planet.<br/><br/>All in all, way too much awesome for us to handle, since this writeup doesn't even contain a lot of the crazy stuff from interludes.  For example, the alien had fallen in love with a human coed who played rugby for Mars University of Rocketry and Telemetry (MURT) and who convinced the Plutonian patrolman to organize a Plutonian rugby team so they could have interplanetary competitions.<br/><br/>We had a few mechanical suggestions from the players, but I'll wait and talk about those tomorrow, since my computer's about to die.  All in all, though, a blast!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217370/#Comment_217370" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-08T22:40:43+00:00" title="July  8, 2009 10:40PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>help Bruce (the Atomic Commando) shoot through the Nth dimensional storm <b><i>into the past</i></b> and kill all the agents of Malius who were preparing to release the super-villains</blockquote>\nOkay but seriously, that is the best thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217433/#Comment_217433" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T07:08:47+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  7:08AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shooting into the past was definitely one of my favorite parts.  Also, the orbital hypercube prisons and the fact that you could attach "atomic-", "rocket-" or "space-" to any word to make it genre appropriate ("Sound travels a lot further in space-air because there's no normal air to get in the way.")<br/><br/>Mechanical issues:<br/><br/>The players specifically remarked afterwards that they always needed more power tokens but always seemed to have too many action tokens.  This was due to a number of things.  First, most cool powers require power tokens, not action tokens.  Second, using an action token to take an additional action in a 5-6 player game quickly became something that was looked down on in our impromptu social contract, just because it made it even longer before another player could take their turn. Maybe if you could spend them to roll-alongside another player, as a helping action, that would have worked better.  As it was, I think we had 1 action token spent the entire game.  April really wanted to spend another, but she decided not to, in order to let other players take their turns.  I'm not sure what to do about the lack of power tokens.  It wasn't as if the players weren't taking any danger; they just spent the power tokens as soon as they got them.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm not really convinced that action tokens and power tokens need to be separate things.  The amount of challenge the characters face is pretty much entirely generated by themselves and the danger dice, so it's not as if the game needs a complex resource-management system to make things interesting (not that having two types of points is really that complex, but anyway...)<br/><br/>The other thing that happened is that April decided she was going to try to either max out her danger or get vaporized, so she started rolling max dice every time.  What this meant is that she was regularly rolling 5 danger, causing a catastrophe, but not necessarily taking any hits (because she could choose not to engage the disaster, but just keep rolling and create another one next time).  While rolling max danger is awesome and exciting for the game, I worry slightly that there's no cap to this and that April would have eventually been rewarded for not engaging with the catastrophes by being given a new special power when she reaches max danger.  Because you only take a hit when your danger result is 2-4 (and then only sometimes on a 3).<br/><br/>The other thing the players said is that it was lame that they could only have one of the powers on their style and roll cards, that being a one-trick poney wasn't as cool as being able to do multiple cool things that were all in-genre.  I can see sorta what John's trying to do; he doesn't want the super powers to overwhelm straight-up uses of traits and two-fisted pulp action / investigation, but the use of powers is already governed by the availability of resource points, especially power points, and if you're maxing out danger dice at 4-5 on most rolls, it's not as if super power uses are that much crazier.  So I think next time we play I might say something like "choose 4 powers from among both your sheets" so then players don't have to use the same two super powers over and over.<br/><br/>Finally, I made the helping rules a bit stronger, which is something I remarked on in an earlier draft.  Converting only half of a helper's successes into d8s makes helping much, much worse than taking a turn on your own, so I made it so that ALL helping successes become d8s, which is still only a 50% conversion rate into hits  if you're stunned or injured and have to roll 5s, but it's a lot better than 25%-35% conversion rate with the current rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217435/#Comment_217435" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T07:16:48+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  7:16AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Honestly, I'm not really convinced that action tokens and power tokens need to be separate things.</blockquote>\nThis rings true to me.

It's not so much "like Buck Rodgers" as "Johnny Quest : Venture Brothers :: Buck Rodgers : Danger Patrol."  And I think that may be part of what threw Eric off.  He came in expecting something with reasonable amounts of gonzo and it just got too silly too fast.  And I'm not sure if that's totally aligned with John's intentions or not.  Clearly, you could play a more restrained version of Danger Patrol and I imagine that, the more I play it, the more I'm going to be looking for something slightly more sophisticated rather than pure cheap thrills, but for a one-shot or just pick-up game, the cheap thrills are pretty damn awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217461/#Comment_217461" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T08:34:57+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  8:34AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This, interestingly enough parallels a lot of people's experiences with Donjon.

And I've been trying to figure out why exactly this is.  I think it has something to do with danger dice not being totally necessary for you to be useful.  If you just take one or two (which can be given by other players), you can still roll just fine.  But I think having to come up with 5 details for every action would be mind-numbing and stupid.

They are now just Action tokens: spend one to activate a power or take an extra action.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Because you only take a hit when your danger result is 2-4 (and then only sometimes on a 3).</blockquote>\nThat's not exactly true. The text says the GM makes a threat move at the level of danger rolled, or "choose a few things with lower danger values if you want." So when someone rolls Danger 5, instead of picking disaster every time, you can do a Danger 4 and Danger 2 move instead, if you want (attack two different heroes, even). Or some other combination, based on what's going on.<br/><br/>Customizing the number of starting powers is fine. I made it 1 and 1 for simplicity's sake, really, but if you want to start with more that's fine. "X out the two powers you don't have," would work, even.<br/><br/>And yes, helping is lame. For now, convert hits 1-to-1 into helping d8s. I'm still mulling over Jason's idea for taking someone else's danger when you help. It's cool. There used to be a rule for "drawing fire" and maybe I need to go back and look at that again.<br/><br/>Thanks for playtesting!

Having more flexibility in the GM's spending of danger definitely avoids that "roll 5 danger every time" thing.<br/><br/>Honestly, having more players isn't necessarily more of a problem than it is in any other large game; you just have to get players to be patient and attentive, though it may be that the gonzo craziness of one-shot-style DP isn't really conducive to patience.  Maybe you should just assign Danger Levels to different numbers of players.  So like 3-4 players = HAZARDOUS! Adequate Danger, 5 WARNING! Extreme Danger, 6+ NOOOO! Apocalyptic Danger.  That way, different groups will know what they're getting into and decide whether they're prepared for their social contract to explode from too much danger.<br/><br/>Also, there's one problem with unifying Action and Power points and that's this: taking another turn is going to be at least twice as useful as activating a power 95% of the time (unless a villain has Resistance). What I've learned from Eric, actually, is that causing an opponent to lose a turn or taking an additional turn (which are effectively the same thing) is about the most powerful thing you can do in any game.  As such, that kind of thing is really, really hard to balance appropriately.  Additionally, Danger Patrol isn't like Agon, where taking another turn is relatively fast.  In DP, it involves declaring your actions, picking your trait dice, activating any abilities, gaining bonus dice, declaring danger dice, having other players declare danger dice, and then rolling.  That's a lot of steps to do twice.  Honestly, I think it would make more sense to be able to spend an action point to either 1) make the action you're already doing more potent (which is what powers do already, so there's no need for that), or 2) add your dice to the roll of another player (basically, replacing the current helping rules, but not causing you to lose a turn in the process).  <br/><br/>So that's what I'm planning on trying the next time I run it: unified Action tokens which either activate powers or allow you to add dice to another player's roll.  I'll let you know how it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217517/#Comment_217517" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T11:43:42+00:00" title="July  9, 2009 11:43AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds good, Jonathan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217520/#Comment_217520" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T11:48:54+00:00" title="July  9, 2009 11:48AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think with some experience you could get players to prep their action to a point - if Steve knows he's going to do a crazy Flyboy thing and use a piece of gear, he can assemble those dice ahead of his turn.

What this meant is that she was regularly rolling 5 danger, causing a catastrophe, but not necessarily taking any hits (because she could choose not to engage the disaster, but just keep rolling and create another one next time).  While rolling max danger is awesome and exciting for the game, I worry slightly that there's no cap to this and that April would have eventually been rewarded for not engaging with the catastrophes by being given a new special power when she reaches max danger.  Because you only take a hit when your danger result is 2-4 (and then only sometimes on a 3).<br/></blockquote>\nThis is a concern I have too. There are some players (me among them) when told that, "the entire community you've been spending the entire session/campaign falling in love with, including your romantic love interest and danger Boy sidekick, are about to be destroyed" will think, "okay, if this happens, I get a subplot in which I can angst over my failure Which Will Be Redeemed/Avenged and I get a new Power - Cool!"<br/>Or they will easily disengage with the fictional part to get the points because, after all, no pc is going to die.<br/><br/>This isn't necessarily a problem for Danger Patrol, it's the way some players are. However, if a 'fix' or remedy is needed, maybe something like:<br/>If a player gets 5+ danger, and they decline the opportunity to stop the catastrophe, any other player who has an action token can leap in and stop the catastrophe; and they also steal the original player's danger in the process.<br/><br/>Alternatively, "stop the catastrophe" is presented as an option. Maybe it's in keeping for Danger Patrol to remove that option and have Danger 5 be: "You narrowly avert a catastrophe, spawning a new threat in the prcess. Tell me how you do it, and you also take a hit."<br/>Helping could be useful method here to stop high danger heroes being vaporised when this happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217661/#Comment_217661" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-10T07:30:35+00:00" title="July 10, 2009  7:30AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2009 7:31AM by nemomeme.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite><br/>About power tokens and action chips: Man, I am smacking my forehead.
