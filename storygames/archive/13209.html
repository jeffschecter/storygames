If your character is being doused in marinade while turning on a spit, with only their wits to protect them, they are winning. I recommend you use the strict Dismal Failure rule. Applying boons and levies according to the persuasiveness of arguments is a bit harsh on the less verbally adept players (though there is always Forthright and Obfuscatory for that. You could put a Limit on the number of rolls, but the rules themselves should quickly burn through points and correct long exchanges.<br/><br/>The amount of rolling, and when you roll depends on the scene. Summarise arguments if they are dragging out, let them continue otherwise. Often, you'll find two players arguing in character - and it's then you call for a roll. For quick scenes, just a phrase between each set of rolls will suffice. You don't need something after every pay to re roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297559/#Comment_297559" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T03:20:10+00:00" title="October 20, 2010  3:20AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm really quite keen to actually hear them in play too though - I want to see how much stuttering and thinking goes on.</blockquote>\nNot much! It has to be quickfire.<br/><br/>The Dying Earth RPG does tend to favour quick-thinking, linguistic players. Get players who <i>aren't</i> wordy to play characters who aren't wordy: the ones who rebuff arguments with "Bah!" and "Don't confuse me with your legal nonsense!". (There's a term in the rules for this. I forget what it is.)\n<blockquote>We've played quite a bit and in my games the dice rolls has tended to slow down or, worse, contradict strong and persuasive arguments.</blockquote>\nNo, but that's good. If you read the Dying Earth books, that's what happens: someone comes up with a <i>brilliant</i>, <i>unanswerable</i> argument and...actually...it's not brilliant after all. Someone just tells them to be quiet.

To quote the rules:<br/><br/><i>Persuasion and Rebuff are not the central focus of Turjan level games, so we recommend that players keep them to a minimum, in the interests of pacing. We\u2019ve also skewed the random tables in favor of the more appropriate styles, by removing Obfuscatory, Contrary and Obtuse, all of which tend to slow the game down. However, even Turjanic characters are persuaded to do things that they might regret \u2013 if you don\u2019t like this, build up your Rebuff.</i><br/><br/>There is also an optional rule:<br/><br/><i>Optional Rule \u2013 Conventional Argument<br/>The Persuasion and Rebuff rules allow your character to be persuaded to do something that you yourself may think is a bad idea. We hope that you will embrace this as a roleplaying challenge. However, if you feel that this rule distances you from your heroic PC, and your GM agrees, then consider the following optional rule. PCs do not have Rebuff ratings, they are completely immune from Persuasion. Persuasion includes the use of any other ability such as Seduction and Etiquette that allows an opponent to affect your behavior.<br/>If your GM allows magic or tweaks that let PCs enhance their persuasive skills, or reduce your GMC opponent\u2019s resistance to such persuasion will give PCs an advantage. Your GM will let you know whether they are permissible.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The%20Bunyip" title="The Bunyip"><img alt="The Bunyip" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/758/nIGUP7BK8UEFU.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The%20Bunyip">The Bunyip</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297565/#Comment_297565" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T04:26:21+00:00" title="October 20, 2010  4:26AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Simon.  Yeah, I'd read those rules.  I suppose I wasn't so enamoured of the idea that players were just supposed to "keep them to a minimum".  I prefer something a little harder.  I can see that players will have no problem ignoring persuasion when it is making their heroic character do something they'd rather not do, but I can see that this self-policing going out the window when it comes to persuading NPCs.  I suppose I'm not so keen on the 'fairness' of that... but maybe I should just get past that.  After all, since when was anything fair in a dying world!? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  There, I've talked myself round.<br/><br/>All this DERPG talk has made me think of another difficulty I have with the rules.  Allow me to elaborate here if I may...<br/><br/>How do you make sure that players persuade and rebuff in their character's appropriate style?  If the GM (or other players) attempt to police it during a conflict it slows gameplay too much, but it feels that if your argument isn't Glib, for example, you should be able to call on that pool when your character's last point was clearly <i>not</i> Glib.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297587/#Comment_297587" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T07:25:30+00:00" title="October 20, 2010  7:25AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, don't bother policing it.
