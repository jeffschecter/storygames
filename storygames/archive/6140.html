After this long, I've come to realize I already lived there.<br/><br/>Simply put, 'The players control their characters and the gamemaster controls the story' is impossible.  If you could find a way to make that happen, you have 'discovered El Dorado'.<br/><br/>Here's the theory of how I do that.<br/><br/>What separates a compelling story from a simple recounting of events is the significance of the parts of the story in relationship with each other.  For example, a detective IRL examines a crime scene; deduces a few suspects; collects clues A, B, C and D; and arrests the guilty party.  (I watch a lot of forensic TV.)  That is a recounting of events; as is, it isn't a very compelling story.  However if, as a gamemaster, you assign some significance to each of the suspects and to the value of a speedier solution, you can create <i>tension</i>.  If you build a sense of intensity of succeeding levels, per clue and match the arrest at or higher than the last level of intensity, you will create a compelling, provocative story.  But do you need to specify the clues, suspects, scenes or actions?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>This is what I mean by living in El Dorado.  I can accept elements and actions created entirely by my players as well as making a few things up on the fly and then <i>add significance to them</i> as I go.  I can mold virtually any kind of input into a compelling story without ever directing or specifying anything.  This is how my players do whatever they want, in total control of their characters, yet I can completely control the story.<br/><br/>My three favorite pieces of GM advice to give are 'give them enough rope to hang themselves', 'pacing, pacing, pacing' and 'when all else fails, run an action scene'.  By giving the players 'enough rope', I put them in total control of their characters; by letting them 'hang themselves', I leave room for me to add significance to the 'rope' they have chosen.  Pacing is perhaps the most important aspect of turning a series of arbitrary events into compelling story parts; as Lajos Egri suggests, all changes in tension must be escalation (or they become anticlimax).  Lastly, I save the possibility of turning any scene into an action scene so that, 'when all else fails' I can sustain or increase the tension level.<br/><br/>This is where I'm innovating with <a href="http://universe6.scattershotgames.com" rel="nofollow">Scattershot</a>.  Along with all the fluff and crunch, I put a few tricks in.  First of all, the whole thing looks like a completely normal, simple, introductory sort of game.  What people don't initially catch is that, playing only the crunch alone is a recipe for disaster.  I've tipped the probabilities against the players.  Now the part of the character and milieu set-up that originally seems of little importance takes complete control of the game.  By playing up these 'mostly fluff' aspects of the game, players gain a resource base that tips the odds back in their favor.  That's the carrot and the stick\xb9 (they need more of the resource that they keep consuming).<br/><br/>I've also added the problem that the GM must play along the same rules (with his own kind of fluff to resource).  Putting the GM on equal level with the players forms two functions; the players realize they have as much control over the game as the gamemaster and it causes the gamemaster to fulfill the resource cycle as well.<br/><br/>What I've done with the fluff to resource is make them into recognizable story components.  What this does is indirectly steers the players (GM included) towards using story elements they know the significance of.  It also makes it easier for the gamemaster to add the appropriate kinds of significance in order to make story elements into story.  That way the game helps first-time players hammer out their own experience with El Dorado.<br/><br/>Oh, and in case anyone is wondering; yes, this is the same Scattershot which was touted as the first ever 'transitional' role-playing game.  By merely categorizing the fluff to resource elements and detailing how to work them not into conflict, the game allows clean and clear transition as different categories are switched in or out.  The basic idea of each part of the game is to lean heavily on only on category per genre (with advanced rules about mixing genres).<br/><br/>Thanks for the time and attention.  Just one question:<br/><br/>Do you think it'll work?<br/><br/>Fang Langford<br/><br/>p.s. Or...what I'm saying is that the 'actions of the characters' controlled by the players is clearly not the same thing as 'the parts of the story' controlled by the gamemaster.<br/><br/>\xb9 Every politician I hear, messes this up.  You use the carrot WITH the stick.  The stick keeps the carrot just out of reach continuously and temptingly.  It was perfected by prospectors to deal with their reticent mules (who were too stupid to realize they weren't making any progress - the stick - towards their goal - the carrot - no matter how far they walked).  Politicians have this idea that they will offer two choices to people; either you can eat the carrot or be beaten by the stick.

Everybody, really, know how to get out of that problem: The GM controls the story, OR the player's controls what the characters do. It's like saying that going right or left when you drive is problematic. It's for this reason that the essays don't call it a "problem". It's not a problem, it's a paradox: everybody can see what REALLY happen during a game, but everybody was invested in ignoring it when writing game manuals that insisted with saying that you should drive turning both right and left at the same time...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136913/#Comment_136913" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-29T14:16:49+00:00" title="March 29, 2008  2:16PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A) That's not what the game manuals said, or not all they said.<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> If it wasn't an actual problem, whatever the game manuals said must have gotten the idea across.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136919/#Comment_136919" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-29T18:04:35+00:00" title="March 29, 2008  6:04PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2008 6:06PM by cydmab.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, first I think what you are talking about is the impossible thing before breakfast<br/>\n<br/>\nEl Dorado referred to something else, ability to be GNS Sim and Nar at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136924/#Comment_136924" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-29T19:35:13+00:00" title="March 29, 2008  7:35PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cydmab</cite>Hmm, first I think what you are talking about is the impossible thing before breakfast</blockquote>\nYes, I was answering Jason' post, not the OP\n<blockquote>El Dorado referred to something else, ability to be GNS Sim and Nar at the same time.</blockquote>\nNot exactly.

You're talking about "GM controls the story; players control their characters." I get that. <br/><br/>Let me read back to you what I think you're saying, so we're on the same page.\n<blockquote><br/>Scattershot gives players control over the story by giving them explicit power to create setting and situation during play. The GM is required to weave that creative input into the fiction as it moves forward. <br/></blockquote>\nNow, if the GM isn't required to use the players' creative input, I don't see your solution really giving the players absolute control over their characters. The GM has the control over their characters, because he decides what character-influencing setting and situation elements come into play at all times. The players get to talk in character and make decisions that, ultimately, are in synch with the GM's story. The GM can discard all player input that doesn't synch with his story. <br/><br/>And if the GM is required to use the player input, then I don't see how the GM controls the story. The players can push the story in ways the GM did not anticipate.<br/><br/>In essence, "the story" is a thing that is created by whoever has authority over the content of play. Characters are part of that same content of play. Separating control of characters from "the story" is a logical fallacy. You don't have a story without characters. The characters <i>are</i> the story. The setting, characters, situation, color... they're all tangled in ways that can't be cut apart neatly. To give players control over the story, you have to give them control over their characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford" title="Fang Langford"><img alt="Fang Langford" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/042/nYHKMUMQV2HC4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford">Fang Langford</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137072/#Comment_137072" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T21:40:45+00:00" title="March 30, 2008  9:40PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey thanks for the responses!<br/><br/>All of you are absolutely correct; this is 'the impossible thing to believe before breakfast'.  I am such a scatterbrain these days.  (And they've changed the idea of El Dorado <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=4281.0" rel="nofollow">since I discovered the place</a>.)  And I quite agree; it is impossible if you are lead to believe that controlling the characters equals controlling the story.<br/><br/>It isn't.<br/><br/>That's why it's no paradox or problem.  What the players do as they control their characters is an ambiguous series of events.  There is no story to it (in the classic sense; crisis-climax-resolution).  Now ask yourself; do you make it a story by reordering, changing or adding more events?<br/><br/>Nope.<br/><br/>You can provide more significance to some of the events.  Any conflict can be a crisis with enough significance.  Any conflict can be a climax, given even more significance.  Any resolution can be the final resolution if it closes the significance brought up by the crisis and the climax.<br/><br/>To 'control the story', a gamemaster merely needs to embellish certain conflicts resulting from whatever actions the players choose.  Notice too, the players are in complete control of their characters.  The gamemaster forces nothing on them, does nothing to control the things done by the players.  If anything, she amplifies them; some of them she makes very amplified or important or significant.<br/><br/>Without controlling them.<br/><br/>But Jason is right.  Whatever the games had written in them, it worked.  Never forget that.<br/><br/>I hope I'm making a point about the nonequivalence of control of characters and control of story.  I'm sorry if I'm not coming through.

So there isn't any actual play to describe.  And I'm not sure I could give an objective recount of any if I had some.<br/><br/>Can I give a designer's example of how it theoretically would work?\n<blockquote>The game is running along fine; the tension level is about at 'page 8' or so.  The story has hit the next 'beat' and one of the players chooses to start the next scene <i>in media res</i>.  Rather than inventing a whole scene herself, she chooses the milieu disadvantage on the gamemaster's sheet called <a href="http://universe6.scattershotgames.com/superpower/index.php?module=wiki&amp;page=MilieuDeathtrap" rel="nofollow">Deathtrap</a>.<br/><br/>She does this because she's running low on experience dice and playing on this disadvantage will get her some more.  She decides that her superhero has been captured by the supervillain and strapped her to the bomb which forms the centerpiece of the story so far.  She gets 1 die for a contrived deathtrap, a bonus die for it being it being a part of the villain's plot, and finally a bonus die for the monologue the villain will no doubt belabor the hero with.  Now she has 3 dice of gimmes that she can use for anything coming up.<br/><br/>Now, in Scattershot, the gamemaster could have said 'no', but she'd have to put up at least one of his own experience dice (to go into a Solomon's auction).</blockquote>\nYou can see how the gamemaster, with a limited resource with which to affect what the players have happen to their characters, cannot control them.<br/><br/>Now I think we have a fundamental disagreement here:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by: Adam Dray</cite>Separating control of characters from "the story" is a logical fallacy.</blockquote>\nI agree that you cannot separate the characters for the 'story' insofar as a recounting of events, but I'm saying that what makes a recounting into a story is the significance placed on the those events.  Further, I think it's clear that it is actually very hard to affect the significance of events with only control of the characters.<br/><br/>In the above example, yes there is a deathtrap scene, but how significant is it to the story?  Does it raise the tension level (say, from 'page 8' to 'page 9 or 10')?  The gamemaster is the only one who can clearly and formally create the circumstances that decide that either this is just another run of the mill deathtraps (somewhat significant) or a climactic encounter (leading directly into the final conflict).<br/><br/>To continue the example, let's the gamemaster chooses to not raise the tension level and (during the monologue) indicates that this is only one of many bombs throughout the city setting off a chase.  The deathtrap becomes only another beat in the storyline, not climactic.<br/><br/>Let's try that again.  This time the gamemaster chooses to make this the pre-climactic scene.  The monologue explains where the villain will observe, from a safe distance, where he will go next.  As expected, the player has her hero escape from the deathtrap.  She has two choices: 1) go after the villain or 2) go somewhere else.<br/><br/>In choice <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, the gamemaster runs the climactic confrontation between the hero and villain, using her own experience dice (there will be a 'final confrontation' disadvantage also) to cause everything to wind up with a simple, comfortable d\xe9nouement.  The player made all the calls on her character's actions (including <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being caught in the deathtrap</span>) and the gamemaster took that input and by adding significance to it, rounded out a nice, familiar story.<br/><br/>If she chose something like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, it might seem complicated, but actually it isn't.  The gamemaster only has to make a simple decision: can she raise the tension any higher (than 'page 10') or does it have to climax now.  Either way, wherever the character goes and whatever they do, it has to be highly significant.  If the gamemaster doesn't feel she can raise the tension any higher, then wherever the character goes, so does the villain (and any other significant loose ends); that's all the gamemaster has to do.<br/><br/>Remember the end of The Incredibles?  It seemed over; everyone was decompressing and talking it out in the limousine on the way home.  But there were loose ends left over...the villain!  So the 'gamemaster' puts the villain at their house.  Heck, this phantom gamemaster even ties up the loose end of Jack-Jack by making the sitter freak out on the phone (keeping the tension up).  Then there is the final confrontation (and it even clears up the whole 'no capes' thread).<br/><br/>Back on the original topic you brought up, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.  Story is not simply the 'content of play'.  The additive, ongoing significance of the content of play as it plays out, turns the content into the story.<br/><br/>The contrast of this idea is that content <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span></b> story; it also means that either a game is railroading (gamemaster control) or likely a poor story (players organizing themselves into a nice story is about as hard as herding lolcats).  All other choices are just a bad mix of these alternatives.<br/><br/>The way of gamemastering I'm trying to explain is the only way I know how.  You see, I'm a lousy writer.  I would never inflict that upon my players.  I also value and am interested in them.  I want to see what they do and I want it to make a difference in the story.  But I want it to do 'story' stories.  I can't tell you how much better my games became after I read Lajos Egri's The Art of Dramatic Storytelling.  I learned how to build tension and have a satisfying climax.  So I put these together and found ways to make the important actions of the players fit together into a 'story' story.<br/><br/>I'm more than familiar of the controversy of this concept, but I'm happy to disagree amicably with anyone who disagrees.<br/><br/>Fang<br/><br/>\xb9 That's kinda why I'm here today.<br/><br/>p.s.

Fake tension is definitely a good practice.  However, it doesn't seem to a universally known one.  Seriously, spread the word; I think it might help a lot of newish gamers.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I am well aware of a group of gamers (I have no idea how big) who want the tension raised <i>for</i> them.  That has always been hard to teach and harder to write.  (Thanks for the complement Tommi!)  Working on the GM milieu sheet and the 'tension meter' (haven't got a name for it yet) has been my work towards making this clear and explicit.  This does not mean that the gamemaster has to share the 'tension meter' or even the milieu sheet with the players; it depend on how much OoC gamestuff the players are good for.  You could just as easily play these mechanics 'behind the curtain'.  I know a few gamers who prefer that and I want to make this work for them too.<br/><br/>Fang<br/><br/>p.s. BTW Mike's right.  'Impossible Things' shouldn't be what this thread is about.  (It should be about getting word out to playtesters, sigh.)  And I am definitely guilty of spamming sore points into this forum.  I knew going in, this was a controversial topic; I'm sorry that I didn't have the courage to believe I could catch anyone's attention without poking a few beehives.  Despite what a lot of people think about me, I'm actually kinda shy and I learned a lot of bad habits on The Forge.  (It is true however, that I'm taking medication for that now.)  I promise I'll throttle back any use of controversies on this forum.  I guess I was just afraid I would be passed over.

That is, we could rewrite it as, "GM controls the story pacing and tension, but not the content; players control their characters (and the story content)." <br/><br/>I can sorta see it, if I squint and turn my head sideways. I am not convinced that story content doesn't <i>necessarily</i> include pacing and tension, but all my points about it would require reduction to the absurd (GM paces the story so slow that the player never gets to introduce her content; the GM manipulates the player's input of story content by using tension to reward content he likes; etc.). I don't think those are terribly useful directions to go with the debate.<br/><br/>Really, though, I don't think you've said anything <i>that controversial</i>, because you've redefined what "story" means in The Impossible Thing. You don't mean it how it was originally intended, as far as I can tell.<br/><br/>The most important thing is, it sounds like you've come up with some pretty cool techniques for distribution of authority for Scattershot. Color me intrigued. I'll go read the basic rules engine and see if I can better understand what you're doing with authority there.
