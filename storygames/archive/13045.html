On October 15th-17th he's running what will probably be his last weekend-long game. It's the third in a series of games based on Broadway musicals, although the games have no plot or character ties between them; each is stand-alone.<br/><br/>Recently he's had a number of player drops, so there are four empty roles out of 70 characters. Usually roles in games of this sort are taken months ahead of time. It's fairly unusual to have this many openings so close to runtime. As the game functions much better with a full slate of characters, I'm throwing a nudge up here to see if anyone might be interested in signing up. <br/><br/>I've had nothing but positive experiences in games run by Mike in the past, and can wholeheartedly recommend them. This game is being run in Hagerstown, MD, which is about an hour and a half outside of Washington DC. The other players are generally very welcoming of newcomers, and no larp experience is required.<br/><br/>I'm happy to answer questions about the game, though contacting Mike directly might be more fruitful. His email, and more information about the game, can be found on this rpg.net posting:<br/><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=535853" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=535853</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
