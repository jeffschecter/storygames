At present, I'm working on hammering it out into an ashcan.  It's reached a level of consistently successful playtesting, by me and also by a guy named Wilmer from Sweden, and it's thoroughly playable and fun, but I want to get some more perspectives on it, so I thought I'd bring it out here to Story Games and wave it around and shout and jump up and down like a manic street preacher in the metro station to try to get some more playtesters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a grim, gritty game, set in the not-to-distant future in a mostly-abandoned land where the Rust is king, where the Rust eats not only the abandoned machines and ghost-towns but civilization and the laws of nature as well.  It's about people who live in a place where life is nasty, brutish, and short, and about them trying to find some sort of meaning in that brief existence.  It's about goals and sacrifices, choices and consequences, tough questions, tenacity, depravity, violence, and hideous opportunities.  It's about doing the math, the cold equations, the Algebra of Need.  It's about how people cope with the horrible.  It's about hope, faith, and determination in the face of doom.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a little bit Mad Max, a little bit Raymond Chandler, a little bit Firefly, a little bit Clint Eastwood, a little bit Tom Waits, a little bit Joseph Conrad, and a little bit William S. Burroughs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSystem-wise, it sports a nifty resolution mechanic where your character's abilities <i>influence</i> success rate, but success is ultimately dependent on how much you're willing to sacrifice--you can accomplish anything, if you're willing to pay for it.  The combat system makes for down-to-earth, in-your-face, blow-by-blow, bone-crunching, avert-your-eyes, knock-down drag-out fights with all the violence and nasty consequences of crunchy Sim-style combat, but without all the charts and tactical maps and endless modifiers.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I'd be happy for <i>anyone</i> to playtest it, but I'm particularly looking for two sorts of people.  The first is people who are already heavy on the scary/intense thematic games, because that's the sort of thing I'm shooting for, and it's not quite hitting that intensity yet.  The other is people who have little to no experience with the scary/intense thematic games but have been wanting to give 'em a try, because I want to see how well this delivers for 'em.  But if you're don't match either of these, you can still playtest it if you want to, and I'll be glad.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe latest draft of the game (actually the rough text-only draft of the ashcan) can be found <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.angelfire.com/indie/btw/rustbelt4.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> (it's fairly longish and all one file, so you're probably better saving it to disc than trying to view it in your browser)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here's some playtest threads on the Forge:<br/>\n<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25814.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25814.0</a><br/>\n<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25948.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25948.0</a>  (Those first two show some problems, most of which have been dealt with since)<br/>\n<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26123.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26123.0</a><br/>\n<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26158.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26158.0</a><br/>\n<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26246.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26246.0</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, of course, you can go ahead and lay out any questions or comments you have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n-Marshall                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146597/#Comment_146597" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T02:01:02+00:00" title="May 29, 2008  2:01AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks very cool.

It's gonna be a sort of analog industrial (that is, rather than sampling or synthesizing the sound of hitting a freon tank with a hammer, I will actually be hitting a freon tank with a hammer and recording it) with blues and Western mixed in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
