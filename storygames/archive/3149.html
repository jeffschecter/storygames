Particularly given the PCs freedom of action (and the games where you didn't have that didn't feel right, somehow). 11000 worlds, etc.</blockquote>\nI think my problem with the old-school games (defined here as those based more on miniatures rules than narrative structure) is that the sheer number of rules and the fact that all movement and combat was square/hex/inches-based made me spend so much time trying to understand and follow all of it that is became a rules-focused game rather than a story-focused game.  I felt like I had to be able to map something and add encounters to it to even play a game of Traveller (or D&amp;D or Gamma World).  I feel like Traveller in particular was all about deck plans and encounter tables and not enough about story arcs and even *adventure*.  <br/><br/>One of the things I like about relatively rules-lite games is that they abstract a lot and trust you as the gamer to fill in the blanks.  Even a game like BW throws away encounter tables and GP-counting and abstracts things in a great way with Circles and Resources Tests.  I find that incredibly freeing as a player and a GM.<br/><br/>Is this just an issue of "Chris as a scaredy-cat 13 year-old" vs. "Chris as a creatively-burgeoning 38 year-old"?  Or is there a truth here that more abstraction equals more creativity?  <br/><br/>I have to admit I'm not totally up on a lot of the hardcore RPG theory, so this may already be a heavily-treaded path.  But indulge me if you will.  I'm asking this because, like many of you, I look back to those games and want to play them and want them to *work*.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71892/#Comment_71892" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T14:27:12+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  2:27PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe a different <i>kind </i>of creativity?

Which means I am, yes, just repeating Jason and Shreyas.  There is a certain satisfaction to be gained in mastering a game and using it as a sort of baroquely complex conceptual paint brush.  There is a very different, but by no means superior or inferior, satisfaction in freely creating within a loose game structure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71916/#Comment_71916" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T15:47:05+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  3:47PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2007 3:49PM by John_Harper.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I'm with Shreyas.<br/><br/>However, once the group has created their own massive world through the process of play, I am very much into exploring all of that stuff.

And to a degree, I love that. Like, especially with martial arts games: GURPS Martial Arts breaks my heart with its "Skill in Knee Attacks; Skill in Elbow Attacks. Skill in Flying Side Kick", it's the epitome of what I don't like about taking away the abstraction.<br/><br/>...however, too much abstraction and you are forced to creatively come up with the rest. This is very fun (for some)... and <b>VERY TIRING</b>. In my Polaris games, I felt like I needed a nap afterwards sometimes.  In games with a lot of abstraction and quick-fly creativity, I find that I need to take breaks, wrap up the game early, or put time in between game sessions, because it's too much mental work to just keep grinding. It's like doing crosswords or speaking in another language for hours.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71950/#Comment_71950" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T22:49:52+00:00" title="May 25, 2007 10:49PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>...however, too much abstraction and you are forced to creatively come up with the rest.

Playing or GMing off-the-cuff can take it out of you, even though I enjoy it a lot.<br/><br/>When I was taking improv earlier this year, the instructor always did several things.  <br/>1. The start of class was all about warmups.  Get used to the space around you.  Get into the improv groove.<br/>2. The games were all intense but short.  Improv folks weren't expected to do any long form work until they had been practicing for awhile (like months or years).<br/>3. A minority of the class was usually performing for a majority.  That gave everyone plenty of rest time to enjoy others' contributions and recharge the batteries before the next insanity.<br/><br/>An interesting parallel, perhaps.  Maybe abstracted story games really do need things like solid buy-in, shorter sessions and defined mental breaks for players *and* GM.  And you are especially right about GM-less games.  Everyone at the table needs to step up for those or they fall flat.<br/><br/>I think we assume these things sometimes, but I for one certainly run into players or groups who come to the table and expect to be entertained.  They aren't used to putting out a lot creatively and aren't always ready for it when it comes.  Even with experienced folks, you give them the spirit stick and you maybe get a sentence or two before they're saying "roll the dice!!"<br/><br/><i>Am I allowed to hijack my own thread?</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71959/#Comment_71959" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-26T01:44:01+00:00" title="May 26, 2007  1:44AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>The games were all intense but short.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>This is a real strength of the "all creation all the time" mode, in my opinion.

And sometimes I would look at my other friends playing a crunchier system and think, "man, those guys are at it from 11am til past dinnertime.  They must really be gaming!"<br/><br/>But I always feel like I got something out of my shorter sessions and really gamed hard.  Thanks for bringing this up.
