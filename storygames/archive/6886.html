The basic idea is to swap out Discipline, Madness and Exhaustion dice for Skill, Essence and Limit dice. Pain dice stick around, and some of the effects of dominance get twisted about. I remade the rules summary on page 34 of the book. Here's an excerpt:<br/><br/>Every time you roll, you roll your Skill dice and Limit dice (if you have any).<br/>The GM selects a number of Pain dice to roll based on the difficulty of the roll.<br/>Once per roll, you can channel your Virtue, increasing your Limit by one.<br/>Any time you roll, you can add one to six Essence dice to your roll.<br/>...<br/>If Skill dominates, everything stays under control. You have the option of removing and Essence check mark or decreasing your Limit by one.<br/>If Limit dominates, your Virtue dominates your personality causing you to behave erratically. Increase your Limit by one.<br/>If Essence dominates, your resources are taxed. Check off one Essence box, and your Anima flares wildly.<br/>If Pain dominates, you pay a greater price. Pay one token to the GM's Shadow bowl.<br/>If your Limit is increased above 6, you Limit Break.<br/>If you must check off an Essence box but can't, you Crash.<br/>If you Limit Break, the Great Curse has a major effect on you. Your Limit clears out completely, you lose one Skill die, and gain one Curse die (which acts like a Limit die, but is permanent).<br/>If you Crash, you have exhausted your magical reserves. You lose access to Essence dice and Limit dice (but not Curse dice) until you rest for a day or two, meditating to regain what was lost.<br/><br/>Characters also have an Excellency (something you do well) and an Essence talent (something you do that is impossible), which function like minor and major exhaustion talents.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's mostly the same. <br/>Here's a short actual play that I emailed a friend of mine to get him interested:<br/><br/>Susie's (that's my wife) outgoing acrobat made an error on the trapeze and was plummeting to his doom when he Exalted as a Night-caste Solar... at the World's Greatest Circus, right in the middle of the Blessed Isle. In attendance was a circle of Terrestrial exalts (of course), so her solar flare not only bleached the room, but also make her an easy target for them. Or, so they thought. Their Air aspect pulled out his bow and shot a charm-enhanced arrow at Pip (the acrobat), which he caught and used the momentum to spin and toss the arrow back. His new skills and magic proved to work well; the attack decapitated it's original shooter.* Pip jumped onto his trusty elephant side-kick Mohinder (now stained white from her anima) and rode off.<br/><br/>Not far behind him, the Earth aspect had summoned a huge, six-legged war horse with his sorcery and gave chase. He eventually cut Pip off and swung hard with his tetsubo. Pip, as quick and dextrous as a monkey, scrambled around and after a few exchanges of blows and near-misses, he slid feet-first under the wide stance of the Earth aspect and crushed his groin with a vicious punch. The Dragon-blood went down like a sack of rocks, and Pip quickly mounted Mohinder, riding off to safety.<br/><br/>And that was in about 20 minutes of play, with short breaks for explaining the rules as we went.<br/><br/><br/>* Crying children were sprayed with gouts of blood. It was... awesome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153205/#Comment_153205" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T14:03:40+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  2:03PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds pretty nifty!

I think there were a lot of hacks when the game first hit RPGnet for the different World of Darkness settings. As someone who loves the Exalted setting (at least, in theory), I immediately saw how it could be used for a that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153263/#Comment_153263" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T17:42:11+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  5:42PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh it's definitely flexible!  I meant what I said literally.  I never <i>imagined</i> doing that with it, but as you've proven, it's doable.  Really, I think the key to DRYH is that everything you do has a risk, and the powers you wield a real price.  As long as you're hitting those notes, you can probably do just about anything with DRYH.<br/><br/>Also, I know what you mean about Exalted.  I think it's kind of my RPG "porn" so to speak.  I love reading the books.  I love the setting and the powers and all that.  But I haven't had much luck running it.  I read a review of the First Age boxed set that had me drooling mentally.  I will probably buy that at some point, and I'll probably never use it.  *sigh*  Oh well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153319/#Comment_153319" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T02:43:53+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  2:43AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2008 2:48AM by Anarchangel.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't rest your Daiklave?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
