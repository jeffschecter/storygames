(That's evening Norwegian time - 20.00 - which I think is 1.00 PM US central time.)<br/><br/>If you'd like to join, well, join! Cool if you let me know in this thread, or on Google+. <br/><br/>If you're not in my circles, just whisper to me in this thread (or post or shout, whatever).<br/><br/>Google Hangouts is a simple video chat thingy. Mike/headset can be used, but if your computer already has a mike and speakers, that usually works fine.<br/><br/>WARNING: Expect some clunkiness as we get used to the technology and the lag and everything. Let's just see how it works out.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TartaRosso" title="TartaRosso"><img alt="TartaRosso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TartaRosso">TartaRosso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339625/#Comment_339625" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T07:21:01+00:00" title="August 19, 2011  7:21AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2011 7:23AM by TartaRosso.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello and.. I apologize for digression (not completely but it's still a digression).<br/>\n<br/>\nI only want to say tha google hangouts is a great tool for playing. In fact I' m having great time playing on google hangouts. We are playing two Archipelago II campaings and we ended a PTA series of 5 episodes. And we made one session of On Mighty Thews.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously is not like playing at the table. It has some "controindications" but it' s the first time I find something that can be compared to the table gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never liked Play By Chat. Too much to write.<br/>\nAnd before g+ the only service really decent for playing was skype but you hav to pay above two callers.<br/>\nMoreover g+ has google document which is very good for keeping trace of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever we did a little presentation of Play By Video (how we call it by extension).<br/>\nIt' s in Italian, and I don' t know why the boy that did the presentation inserted even many maps d&amp;D-style; (probably because many people plays D&amp;D;). However you can watch the tools that you can use with g+ .<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.dragonisland.it/web/listaarticoli/12-gdr/756-play-by-video" rel="nofollow">Play By Video</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.dragonisland.it/web/distribution/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=3084&amp;p=37025#p36994" rel="nofollow">The Second Video</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUnlucky my english is poorly fluent and so I can' t partecipate to the hangover.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
