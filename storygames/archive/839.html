                    So I recently got to play Primetime Adventures and Nine Worlds.  I'm also playtesting Agora online a lot.  In PTA, players throw around Fan Mail and accumulate litle piles in front of them.  In Nine Worlds, you play half of every scene with a first full of cards.  In both cases, the tactile experience of having this stuff in your hand, stuff that often represents your options and resources in the game, is pretty cool.  By contrast, when I take the very dice-fiddly system of Agora into an online setting, it's been difficult to keep the dice in front of the players, which is essential information as they proceed through each scene.  I think I solved this adequately, but the amount of effort involved in getting this accomplished underscored how much the dice on the table convey to the players.<br/><br/>So the thesis is: games with stuff that you hold in your hand or move around the table or whatever are pretty cool.<br/><br/>Can somebody who's played Exalted on tabletop talk about essence motes tracked with glass beads?  I understand Iron Heroes uses tokens; how's that work out around the table?  What about Deadlands' use of cards and poker chips?  Do these fiddly bits make the game a little more tactile, hands on, and fun?  Or am I barking up a ficus?                </div>

                            All I can say is that you're dead right. Here are things that I've seen noted before about why "stuff" works well:<br/>
 - Psychologists tell us that when we touch an object it creates a feeling of ownership of that object. This is why music stores will insist you play the instruments.<br/>
 - Given that people get that little ownership high, handing out such tokens makes reward systems a bit more potent as players will (irrationally), want the objects more than if they were handled abstractly. On the other end...<br/>
 - Objects can serve as cues or triggers. This is something that people often miss, but if you have a rule that has nothing to indicate that it can be used ever, it will tend to get forgotten. Tokens remind people that they have them to use much better than pushing around numbers on a sheet. <br/>
 - Tokens movement can shortcut the need to communicate something. The movement can act as the communication itself, and say very complex things, too. <br/>
<br/>
In Universalis, for instance, people tend to pitch Coins into the pot as they narrate, obviating the need to state which things it is that they're paying for (though often they have to recap afterwards). In the game Crux - still not done, IIRC - the question of where a token is, in the bag, or elsewhere has significance about what it means (it's part of the character if it's in the bag). <br/>
<br/>
So, yeah. The only problem I personally have is that I like fine granularity, and that means lots of token handling potentially. I'd love it if somebody could come up with a solution to that problem. <br/>

                            No, you're right.  TSOY is fun, in part, because of people hurling bonus dice around.  In The Roach you invoke some ass-hat NPC and slam down a die to represent them.  In MLWM you've got those three special dice, and when they get touched everybody knows <i>it's on</i>.  It's very satisfying.                        </div>

                            The tactile appeal to RPGs with cards has led me to the concept that I love that fun so much I will try to put something like that in every game I make (if I ever make any). Deadlands had cards and poker chips and I loved it.<br/><br/>Dungeoneer is a big influence on me, too.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I'm realizing that I turned old Verge -- a game that could be played very easily online -- into new Verge -- a game that absolutely needs a big freakin' piece of paper with the network diagram on it in front of the players. It can't be played online feasibly unless I find a decent internet-whiteboard program that satisfies a few requirements that most internet-whiteboards don't consider.                        </div>

<p>Essence motes are notoriously fiddly, and it's often tactically important to know <em>exactly how many</em> you have, so it's not very pleasant to use glass beads for them.</p>
<p>However, slower currencies work pretty well; I have tried using coins for Willpower points and that's pretty satisfying. Also, any Exalted player will be able to describe the visceral impact of counting out and rolling pools of like thirty dice. It is, in fact, pretty cool.</p>
<p>The "battleclock" thing that rpg.net cooked up for tracking Ealted 2nd edition combat time is also a really cool, informative thing. I love it.</p>
<p>Similarly I don't ever play D&amp;D without miniatures, and I usually set aside designated dice for my various attacks and abilities: "This is my sword and these are my sneak attack and this is my ninja pepper bomb..." Besides being fun it's much easier than having to look up what to roll.</p>
<p>I'm curious to see the way Torch trading works out in face-to-face play; on IRC it's clumsy and confusing. (One of my perennial woes is my habit of designing games that are hard to test online.)</p>

                            One of the most underrated games of our time, the Marvel Universe RPG, was played entirely with stones being moved around on character sheets and compared to each other. This made the learning curve absolutely blow the pencil-and-paper-and-addition-and-subtraction games out of the fucking water.<br/>

Capes' counters are another good example.                        </div>

                            Yeah, Adam, I'm of two minds about designing games and online testing.  On the one hand, damn would it be more convenient.  On the other, though, I'm not sure if I <em>want</em> to design a game that's optimized for online play.  There's something very visceral and immediate about tabletop play and throwing counters around and whatnot, and dismissing the import of that leads in bad directions, I think.  On the other hand, I think designing an RPG specifically for online/MUSH/IRC play would be an interesting and potentially worthwhile endeavor.<br/><br/>Shreyas, thanks for the essences motes comment.  I know there's got to be some parameters of usability that applies to using physical tokens; I may need to play some Exalted tabletop to experience that uncomfortable edge.<br/><br/>JD -- yeah, I'm all about that.  There's a boardgame called Prophecy that has you track everything with colored beads on either side of your character tile (right side is spent, left side is available).  That's some good stuff.                        </div>

We never played enough of the game to internalize the physical process and concentrate more fully on the imagined events in part because of the Fiddly Bits Criticism.  (In fact, it's now a joke at the table that all indie games are fancified board games.  Drives me apeshit.)                        </div>

It took me turning into a total <i>Dogs</i> fanatic to even get them to consider playing the game.  I think it's because we use a lot of physical items in our game - but it's generally props, notes, and other items with some excuse for existing in the fiction.  We touch the dice <i>maybe</i> three or four times a session unless there's combat.  So group norms about what tactile objects are "playful" and which are obstacles to play could also be involved here.  I think that was the case for my group at least!<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            I used to play quite a lot of Deadlands and I found all the bits quite fiddly. <br/>Then again Deadlands did use: multiples of evey kind of dice, loads of poker chips, multiple decks of cards and coloured paperclips for wounds.

<p>I'm really for pushing complexity out to board-game-like structures, rather than squirreled into books and character sheets. So I like that tactile stuff.</p>
<p>However, remember that many gamers have a more limited take on which game elements are more "playful", as Jess says. A game that's tactile will be a superquick turn off to lots of people, at least insofar as it's a roleplaying game.</p>
<p>In my case, the three games I've done so far have been classified more as card or board games than roleplaying games by players/reviewers, and I'm basically okay with that hybrid status.</p>

                            Yes, the tactile thing, I completely agree. I played a LARP recently where you had to exchange glass beads when you used an ability. Oddly, it was much more satisfying than laminated cards.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that...<br/>
<br/>
It's bad when it gets gratuitous. I hate games that say "You need three stones for each player: red, white and blue". And I read the rules and think: well, I can't be arsed to buy coloured stones, but I've got loads of different coloured dice, and they'll do fine.<br/>

Dice and cards you can assume people have.  Poker chips and paperclips are on the periphery.  If you're going for anything else, you should provide it.                        </div>

                            Using a bowlful of random dice as the "gems" in 1001 Nights is fantastic, espcially if you've got gorgeous jewel-tone dice to caress.  It puts you in mind of the sultan's court as you lay them down.   They give that tangible positive feedback that fan mail does by giving you input on what parts of a story you'd like to see come in to play,   as well as setting the mood.                        </div>

                            Polaris should use a big, preferably blue but definitely a cool color d6.  I like to put it in the center of the table, and big enough so that no one fiddles with it ever.<br/>

When the die comes out, shit is going down.<br/>

I also find the idea that all indie games are fiddly bit focused ... odd.  Some are (BtI, Dogs, Under the Bed) and some aren't (PTA, Polaris, Sorcerer.)  It's secondary.<br/>

                            The tactile thing can be great, but kind of picking up on what others have said, I find it's best when the kinesthesis matches what feels important in the game at the time.  I like the dice in DitV, because the rolling of all those dice at the start of the conflict feels like the drum roll building tension, the looking at the dice (and if you're me, putting them in number order)  feels like sizing up your opponent, smacking them down on the table in raises and sees feels like 'Well, take that then!' and 'Ha, missed me, is that the best you can do?'  All that tactile stuff feels like an extension of and a part of the drama in the game I find most enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
When the tactile sensation is in conflict with what feels important to me, then it stops being fun and can distract. I'm not sure exactly why, but Trollbabe comes to mind here.  Something about the ticking off the reroll items, but I can't identify what doesn't sit right with me, and it's probably different for everyone.<br/>

                            So, I played <i>Descent</i> for this first time this weekend.  It's this huge, beautiful boardgame from FFG, and it's basically the next generation of the old dungeon-crawl pseudo-RPG boardgames like Talisman and various things ending in -quest.<br/><br/>Opening the box, it is a cascade of beauty.  Full plastic figs, tons and tons of colorful counters, and unique and interesting dice, Every piece ties into the mechanics of play, which are clever and well-crafted, and it's fun to just put together a dungeon.<br/><br/>It's also a complete freaking nightmare to play.  It was periods of fun interrupted by period of "Where's the money? Where are the conquest tokens? Crap, could someone grab those health tokens off the floor?  Is this the right Rune token?"<br/><br/>Now, while this is not technically an RPG, the game is very clearly going for much of the tactile appeal we're talking about here, and I think they ended up overshooting the mark.<br/><br/>Now, I think it's fixable, and next time we play, were' so using dice and paper to keep track of a few things to try to minimize the clutter, but it definately is a useful cautionary example of what happens when you go too far.<br/><br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Rob: While lengthy in play, Runebound does some of the same things but tones it down a notch. The board (game world) is an overhead view. Creatures are cards pulled from a deck. I've had to get a fishing tackle box to keep all of the tokens (although the variety of tokens is much smaller, I'm sure).                        </div>

                            I have a system for my new Greek heroes game, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2006/06/agon-beta-test-version.html" rel="nofollow">Agon</a>, in which the player holds dice in her hands to represent the character's weapons. Like, 2d6 in your right hand to represent your sword and 1d8 in your left hand to represent your shield. Two-handed weapons have dice that you split between your hands. And there are some fiddly bits that let you shift dice back and forth between hands to represent changes in weapon use (like fighting defensively with a spear).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm enjoying the tactile feedback of tossing my sword dice from my right hand to attack and then the shield dice from my left to defend. The little bit of kinesthesis helps give the feeling of being in a battle.                        </div>

                            John that's a super cool idea.  I could see applications of the same principle, like having two players plunge their hands into a bag containing a set array of dice and pull out whatever dice they could, affording a relative advantage or disadvantage based on their wrestling around and eventual draw.                        </div>

                            Thanks, fellas. The game has changed a bit after playtesting, but the "weapon dice in hands" thing has stayed. I'm in the last stages of production on the game now and will have it at GenCon. So get ready to get your Greek on.                        </div>

                            Oh dear God.<br/><br/>Anyway...<br/><br/>I'm trying to use glass beads for Artha in Burning Wheel, but I only have 2 colors, and my players keep writing on their sheets anyway. I may make it more of a "rule" next time, see how it goes. One advantage - <i>I</i> always know how much Artha they have if they use a pool of tokens.<br/><br/>I use tokens for Time and Strain in Timestream totally for kinesthetic reasons. Watching one color go down while the other rises creates good tension, I think. Seems to work fine.<br/><br/>Also, I think that the passing of paper for Burden creation in Carry has a cool unintended side effect, in that it creates a physical relationship between you and the people on either side of you, as you pass and receive paper and read what the last person wrote. It's very satisfying to <i>watch</i> at least....I haven't had the opportunity to report from the other side of the screen, as of yet.                        </div>

                            I have in mind a system for magic where environments have "ambient magic" that behaves a bit like weather (or temperature) - not always the same, but predictable within a broad range for a given locality. And certain characters can tell, but only approximately, how much is available.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of using bags or jars of small coins, poker chips, dried beans and the like to represent the available "pool" of magic. If your character has a certain level of ability, you get to weigh the (opaque) bag in your hands to get an idea of how much magic is available. If they have a higher level of ability, it's in a clear jar so they can see as well as feel - but it's still an estimate.                        </div>

Oh, that's wonderful.<br/><br/>You see, I love this sort of thing. There's a tendency to think of things like dice, cards, coins, beads in a bag and so on purely as randomisers. But once you start using their other physical properties - you can spin coins, you can use dice as counters, you can guess the weight of beads - it gets really interesting.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            The beans-in-a-jar thing is really hot.  Riffing on that, imagine a system where quantity was somehow important, and a magician player would, say, spread out a mess of lentils in front of her (or LARPing, in a magic circle around them) and you'd just have to eyeball it and out-lentil her.                        </div>

                            I like that one, and it triggered another idea. The mage player must extract from the jar/bag a number of beans sufficient, but not excessive, for the spell he/she intends. The real-world time it takes to describe the spell, extract the beans, and place them in a bowl is the amount of in-game time the mage takes to cast the spell. So you can go for carefully, but more slowly, taking the right number of beans (and possibly getting beaten to the punch), or you can just grab approximately the number of beans and risk the consequences. <br/><br/>Which are: If you take too few beans, the spell falls short in some way (distance, area of effect, power, whatever) and doesn't achieve all you hoped. If you fall short by more than a defined number, say 5, it doesn't go off at all and you have wasted your turn and your beans/mana resource.<br/><br/>If you take too many beans, the spell is overpowered, and Bad Things happen. Worst case, you may face the <a href="http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/cast/death.html" rel="nofollow">Death of Insanely Overpowered Fireballs</a>. Or you may just get some splashback, affecting your companions, yourself, and/or innocent bystanders, or causing the intended effect but not in the intended manner. (The target troll shrinks, but retains all his strength; he's now harder to hit but he can do serious ankle damage.)<br/><br/>You grab the beans first, count them and work out the match/mismatch to the declared spell's required number of points afterwards. So you need to know your spells, and how many beans make five.                        </div>

                            I don't see the underpowered/overpowered distinction as being that fruitful.  In my experience, overpowered is almost always more fun!  Crazy magic gone awry is awesomeness, and the automatic spell fizzle is just boring.  We need real pressures to keep people from drawing big scooping handfuls and bringing down the house, and we need to get rid of the forced fizzle.<br/><br/>How about these totally ripped off ideas...<br/><br/>A) There's just the one mana pool for everyone.  It's all the mana in the world.<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> If you draw too much, the excess goes to the GM!<br/>C) If you can't supply all the mana needed for the spell using what you've drawn from the pool, the character has to Pay a Price, or let the spell fizzle.  (And must the Price be causally linked with the act of casting the spell?)<br/><br/>So, the process:<br/><br/>1. Choose your awesome magical affect.  We identify a casting cost in a number of beans.<br/>2. Scoop your mana!<br/>3a. If you select exactly enough, you're golden.<br/>3b. If you scoop too much, the GM gets the excess.<br/>3c. If you scoop too little, we figure out a Price.  Then you choose to Pay it, or Fizzle.<br/>4. Effects are narrated.<br/><br/>-Jason                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I understand Iron Heroes uses tokens; how's that work out around the table?</blockquote>
Technically, IH doesn't use <i>literal</i> tokens, it just uses the term. I think Mearls used "tokens" as an artifact from the video-game power-ups that inspired the mechanic, as well as to differentiate them from other "points" in the game, e.g., hit points. At least, the book never outright says, "Use a physical representation for these at the table."<br/><br/>What's interesting is that the mere use of the term makes an impression; I knew, intellectually, that Mearls didn't mean "glass beads," but I used them for tokens in my IH games anyway.<br/><br/>What's even more interesting is that the players in the IH games I've played eventually stopped using the beads. Tokens are generated by player choices, not handed out by the GM, and they come and go a <i>lot</i>. Ergo, it became a lot simpler to just track your own tokens as tick marks on paper; constantly reaching into a communal bowl for beads was a PITA.<br/><br/>Of course, it's important to remember that IH is a D&amp;D variant, and thus already has a big tactile aspect: minis on a battlemat.<br/><br/>And this, gentle readers, is a reason why I think that it's cool when indie, non-mini-using RPGs find ways to "add back in" tactile bits (and why many "lite" RPGs that remand the battlemap to the GM's crainium kinda don't interest me).<br/><br/>E.g., for the few BW games I've run, I printed out and laminated the Fight! and DoW scripting sheets for use with erasable markers. They not only serve a mnemonic purpose (having all the maneuver data), but also are like a scorecard the player gets to fiddle with during the game. There's a positioning comparison diagram on the BW wiki that is also very cool, and which I'd like to find more ways to use at the table. And the diagraming aspect of Firefight in BE looks really freakin' cool.<br/><br/>I wonder if there's also a social contract issue at the core of a lot of fiddly stuff. Mearls has written about the importance of minis in tactical RPGs; they negate "Mother may I" in combat. I would think that fiddly bits in other types of RPGs serve a similar purpose. The proof of your fan mail, bennies, token abilities, whatever is sitting there right in front of you.                        </div>

                            (waves hands; returns mouldering corpse to life)<br/><br/>Hey!  How important is the timing of tactile interaction?  Is it way better to have dice/cards/adzuki beans flying all the time, or can the same effect be had with a flurry of mad bean-tossing followed by stretches that just address how that toss turned out?<br/><br/>I ask because right now in Grey Ranks everybody tosses their mission dice in a big pot at the beginning of each scene, and then slowly pluck them out over the course of the scene.  So there's a flurry of tactile fun followed by long intervals of relative calm on the die-handling front.  The plucking them out is fun, but it is decision-fun rather than handful-of-sparkly fun.                        </div>

Dude, that is brilliant.  On top of that, I think you have helped me come up with the resolution mechanic that I'm going to implement into the tactics game I'm working on (was called Tactica, now called... well, Tactica, still, but I'm looking for something that doesn't suck butt cheez).<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.kitkowski.com/lj/stoled.JPG"/> </div>

                            No, Andy, don't stealz0rz!  I have c0pyrights!<br/><br/>Josh, it's like this:<br/><br/>There's a mission you've arrived at collectively (via a fun method, not relevant).  Everybody throws two dice in a common pot (these mean something and offer interesting choices but, not relevant).  Anyway, you toss in your two dice, so does every other player.  So you have a pile of dice that show successes, failures, and edge cases plainly - that's what you have to work with, the story of your mission.  Then each player can, if they want, tell a little tale about something cool they want to do to further the mission.  The guy to their left then chooses any die to represent this, maybe a success or maybe a bad painful character-shredding failure, and you are off to the races.  When all the dice are gone, the mission is over and you move on to the next scene.  Oh, and this whole process is actively interrupted by personal vignettes, one per player per scene (not relevant but that's where the teen s3x0rz comes in).                        </div>

                            Man, I'm clearly on a totally different wavelength to everyone else..!<br/><br/>RPGs more like boardgames = teh goodness...?  Are you nuts?  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  Most boardgames rapidly bore the shit out of me.  It's one of the reasons I like roleplaying games.  You know, for the whole "collaborative storytelling, portrayal of a different persona, emotional involvement in a set of characters" kind of deal that you don't get in boardgames (at least not the ones I've played)<br/><br/>I'm not that bothered either way about whether I use tokens, stones, dice or cards.  It mostly doesn't seem to affect my game particularly deeply.  Character sheets are convenient: I like having everything I need to know on one piece of paper, not scattered around a load of dice and tokens.<br/><br/>Miniatures in RPGs do actively annoy me though.  I can't be bothered with the fiddliness, and actually it is a counter-immersive experience for me.  I don't like the fact that it makes me feel like my character is just a token in a boardgame.  Its annoying enough that it would prevent me playing in a game which heavily used minis.  When we hit tactical combat time, if necessary we just use a sheet of graph paper and pencil on it, updating every round. One small sheet of paper, much easier than a load of minis and a big tactical play sheet.  Mostly it's not an issue, combat is just described.<br/><br/>Having said that I have occassionally experienced the stuff others mention:  Exalted's huuuuge dice p00lxx0rz are very satisfying depite the fiddly factor, and I like the action of whacking down your 2 dice raise as you make your action in DitV.  But tokens, paper clips, stones, coins etc.  I don't mind them but they're not really a turn on either.  I tend not to use them much simply cos it's more fiddly than just having sheet.<br/><br/>Actually something occurs to me:  do you guys generally play all sat round a table?  Cos we generally play sprawled around the living room on sofas and comfy chairs and the floor.  Having a pool of counters, or tokens to keep track of gets annoying because they fall down the back of the sofa or get batted away by kittens.  A character sheet and one or two dice is ideal.  You can have a sheet just sat on your lap or on the floor next to you: easy, no reaching to the coffee table to trade a token or whatever.<br/><br/>Sorry to be the voice of dissent.  Hope I'm not ruining the zen.  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>  Just thought I'd add the viewpoint of one who isn't so enamoured of tactile appeal.  Not everyone is so keen on the whole "rpgs need to be more like boardgames thing."  To me it just kind of distracts from the "immersion", to use the controversial and ill-defined old cliche.  (But actually it's true...)<br/><br/>Drew                        </div>

                            What are the 5 games you think of when you think of boardgames?<br/><br/><br/>I ask because when I, personally, say RPGs need to be more liek boardgames, I don't mean "RPGs need more pieces and color" I mean "RPGs need to have the kind of tight integration between their rules and their intended mode of play that new boardgames have really started to show, especially the ones who use powerful, simple mechanics."  <br/><br/>So if you hear the comparison and are thinking people are saying RPGs need to be more like Axis and Allies (init's minis, tactics and physicality) , then yeah, to hell with that. But if someone says it and means RPGs should be more like, say, Shadows over Camelot (In it's handlingof trust, player contribution and ratcheting tension) then I can't raise anythign liek that kind of objection.<br/><br/>Now, obviously there's a slant in a thread about tactile elements, but if you hear the screaming as people talk about playing Descent, there's definately no "more == better" sentiment. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I'm there with Rob. My interest in "RPGs more like (insert: "...those new Crazy German...") Boardgames" is mainly in the following:<br/><br/>1) Boardgames are easy to whip out and play. Traditional RPGs require hours of setup, usually on the head of one person.<br/>2) You can play one completely in 2-4 hours.<br/>3) Adding up 1 + 2, the result is "...and thus it's much easier to get new people into the hobby".<br/><br/>But even beyond that, I'm busy as fuck at work. When I get home, I am often very tired (part of that is because I'm out of shape and just naturall tire easy these days, I'm working on that though). I want to meet my friends for the Weekly Gaming, but if I'm always the GM, I'm gonna be tired or burned out or whatever, and the games aren't gonna be sharp unless I start slamming coffee and Red Bulls.<br/><br/>So while I want to recruit Normals more, I also want more games where we can whip out and play something grand and interesting and fun in 2-4 hours with no prep.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard is close to that once you know the rules. The upcoming "Whatever the new title for AG&amp;G is" is TOTALLY like that. But I want MOAR.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Drew said:<br/>
<br/>
"Miniatures in RPGs do actively annoy me though. I can't be bothered with the fiddliness, and actually it is a counter-immersive experience for me. I don't like the fact that it makes me feel like my character is just a token in a boardgame. Its annoying enough that it would prevent me playing in a game which heavily used minis. When we hit tactical combat time, if necessary we just use a sheet of graph paper and pencil on it, updating every round. One small sheet of paper, much easier than a load of minis and a big tactical play sheet. Mostly it's not an issue, combat is just described."<br/>
<br/>
(I'm having problems using the quote thingie, sorry all)<br/>
Hmm. Okay, I like minis-A.Lot. But I've also regularly heard similar comments from multiple posters across multiple boards.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to point out that often ( not necessarily refering to Drew specifically), these opinions seem based on very limited types of miniatures usage. Generally, that usage is only in the context of tactical combat, usually in math heavy systems, and not infrequently with systems that have lots of stop and start reaction effects.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, fiddly.<br/>
<br/>
However, I don't think that as much emphasis has been placed on exploring other ways that minis could be used. Or for that matter, I don't think all that deep a look has been taken at both the potential and limitations of a minis heavy medium.<br/>
<br/>
Just off hand, I've gotten a lot of use out of the idea of using minis in a fashion similar to the use of the vision cads in Everway. The mini becomes a source of inspiration, questions, and background building. Beyond that, other models ( terrain, etc) further that concept. That's just off the top of my head.<br/>
<br/>
Things I don't see as much are fundamental questions. What does scene-framing mean in the context of minis usage? What part could the hobby aspects (painting and modelling) play in mechanics? How could real world concerns like dollar cost and building time be integrated into a game system heavy on minis. At what times are detailed movement and range systems valuable in relation to using minis, and when can the dispensed with in favor of something simpler?<br/>
<br/>
I think there are other questions that relate as well: With newer game designs experimenting with shared narration and shared adventure/world-building, can some of those concepts be translated for minis use? Is there room for mechanics that interact with both a metagame/club level of player interaction and the tabletop play itself ( not unlike the optional Universalis metagame duties awards)?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know the answers to those, but I am awfully curious.                        </div>

                            What JBR said - That's what minis traditionally do; it's a very specific usage that's worthwhile for particular things.<br/>
<br/>
It's not the only thing you _can_ use minis for, and being aware of what they're good at (compacting information is one - see Mechaton, the WizKids' "constructible strategy games") and what _other_ tokenish things do that you're not doing with minis helps to expand your palette of effects.                        </div>

                            I actually like the emotional distance using miniature (etc) can put between players and the characters.  It makes for a different type of game.<br/>
<br/>
"I swing my sword at the Orc!" vs. "The Elf swings her sword at the Orc!"<br/>
You ARE the Elf.  vs.  You control the Elf character.<br/>
<br/>
For my game I want people to feel they are controlling characters rather than BEING those characters.  The characters are working together... but the gameplay is competitive. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>
<br/>
If you're working on a game that's more on the RP side than the G side, I agree that things like miniatures can detract from the immersive experience.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>What are the 5 games you think of when you think of boardgames?</blockquote>
Let's see.  The first five boardgames into my mind are: Monopoly, Cluedo, Chess, Kill Doctor Lucky, Escape from Colditz.  So I guess when I automatically think "boardgame", and given various comments about the German new wave, I'm probably not immediately thinking exactly the same kind of boardgame as everyone else.<br><br>But before you suggest Shadows over Cameleot, Settlers of Catan or various other German games, can I say that I have played a fair few of them too?  A friend is a total geek for these kind of games, to the extent that he has his Settlers box signed by Klaus Tuber (insert rolly eyes here),  so he's often getting me to play them.<br><br>Mostly I find them fun to an extent, moreso than the traditional boardgames, but overall leaving me slightly cold.  I'd usually be willing to play again, but wouldn't be likely to suggest it.<br><br>The only 2 boardgame/cardgames I would repeatedly play and actually suggest would be Settlers of Catan and Pit, and actually I can see why people would like elements of those to influence RPGs.  But in both what I like is a feature that often occurs in RPGs anyway: the rapid realtime unmediated back and forth chat between the players.  Specifically in Pit I love the impending sense that IT WILL END SOON, and the frantic rush as everyone tries to complete their set.  It's possibley the most addictive game ever.  I always kind of thought that why I'd enjoyed them was because of their "rpg-like" elements, rather than them being "boardgame elements which could be brought into rpgs"  But like I say, other than those two I'm not really a board game kind of guy.<br><br/>Hmm.  Now that I think about it, someone should try and write an rpg based on Pit.  That would rock.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>1) Boardgames are easy to whip out and play. Traditional RPGs require hours of setup, usually on the head of one person.<br/>2) You can play one completely in 2-4 hours.<br/>3) Adding up 1 + 2, the result is "...and thus it's much easier to get new people into the hobby".</blockquote>
OK, I totally get this.  I guess as someone left slightly puzzled by teh boardgame love, I was a bit mystified as to what exactly people wanted to take as inspiriation.  those elements I can see as being totally beneficial, and had obviously identified them in games such as DitV (my go-to for quick and easy setup).  I just hadn't really thought of those elements coming from boardgames.<br/><br/>Thanks for clarifying folks.  I think I see more clearly what people are getting at.<br/><br/>Drew                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            coming in late into the discussion, I like the idea with the bean grabbing magic power scaling thing. Only it also has a danger that it produces too many magic-using suicide bombers ("I'll grab all I can - I'll at least take the heathens with me!"). Granted - it's not as easy as with the unlimited mana rules S. John Ross wrote for GURPS (although I liked them as well), but the danger's still there. So, between a real danger of being under- or over-powered and easily abusing the ability to overpower ones magic, a compromise might be found. Ideas, anyone?                        </div>
