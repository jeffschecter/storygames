I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m interest in knowing about your most memorable character.   Specifically, I would like to why it so memorable.  Was it because of what occur in the game you played in, or was it all work you put into developing it?    For my purposes I would like to know what game the character was created for. <br/>\n<br/>\n I would also like some details about either of your choices.  For example, if you choose the work you put into your character, tell me what you did.    Did you find a really cool mini; write a big old back-story, and so on.   If you choose what happen in game, tell me about the events that occur                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
