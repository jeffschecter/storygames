I've come across a few examples of this, some in practice and some hypothetical, so let me clarify what I mean.\n<ul><li>Multiple games in parallel for one story. <a href="http://seannittner.livejournal.com/101739.html" rel="nofollow">Sean Nittner and Travis Lindquist </a> did this, with half the players playing <strong>Agon</strong> and half playing <strong>In a Wicked Age</strong>.</li><li>Multiple games in sequence for one story. Someone, and I can't remember who, played a game that had a prologue using <strong>In a Wicked Age</strong> and then the majority of the game in <strong>Mage: the Ascension</strong> (or was it <strong>Mage: the Awakening</strong>?)</li><li>Multiple games interleaved for one story. Lula (James) has suggested that a <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12889&amp;page=1#Item_47" rel="nofollow">Scott Pilgrim game</a> might usefully be played using <strong>Misspent Youth</strong> for most of the game, shifting into <strong>Fight!</strong> when there is conflict between the YOs.</li></ul>\nEach class demands certain accommodations from the group. The first class demands some form of translating mechanics (not, per se, fiction, though) between the games. The second might, depending on the specific situation, require some character-representation translation between the games (though it could skip that, if there's a break in the fiction such that characters will not overlap). The third will require maintaining character representations for two or more games simultaneously, and translating lasting effects between systems.<br/><br/>So, are there other classes of mixed-game stories you can think of? Experiences or ideas about this that you've had? I'm particularly interested in what to do about these translation layers I mentioned in the previous paragraph.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293995/#Comment_293995" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-20T04:38:20+00:00" title="September 20, 2010  4:38AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In-fiction justification for shifting to a different system and setting.<br/><br/>My long-running Feng Shui campaign had Christmas Specials, where a critical shift would plunge the characters into a strange world.

One table had minions of a Master who was siphoning power from an artifact, and the other table had enlightened monks trying to find the artifact (the source of imbalance) and fix it.<br/><br/>It worked out well because there are literally no overlaps in mechanics.  MLwM doesn't even address most of the things you would expect to roll dice for in Unending River.  The Minions in MLwM could try to make Connection scenes with the monks, which was awesome.  Roleplay the scene out, and then resolve the roll in MLwM, with no need to roll anything from Unending River.<br/><br/>The Monks could do whatever they wanted to the setting itself, and it wouldn't mess up dice for the Minions.  I mean, it certainly affected them story-wise when the gates to the Master's palace exploded inward and the castle was invaded, but the only mechanical opposition that the Minions can face has to be the Master.<br/><br/>I feel like I'm not communicating this well, but basically, I mean to say that MLwM can handle the simultaneous case really well because of it's focus.<br/><br/>~also~<br/><br/>We've run multiple games in one story before, all of the parts taking place within the same three day period.  We got some great feedback, as players in part 5, for instance, witnessing an explosion in the distance, got to have that "hey, that's me doing that!  I mean, the other me... cool."<br/><br/>We've done this in a few variations at conventions over the years, but we always force major events to feed forward, especially when they are unexpected.  A great tool for this is to have a formalized interview sheet to spell out the key events, key characters, and set-pieces or props that should come back into the fiction.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this is the kind of thing you're looking for, but maybe?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294095/#Comment_294095" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-20T15:38:16+00:00" title="September 20, 2010  3:38PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Well, I'm not looking for anything besides people's experiences with this.

I was running Ars Magica, while the other GM/group were playing Vampire Dark Ages. <br/><br/>We GMs had an overall plan as to the Big Bad and what was happening, and the two groups were both involved in these events from their own perspective. As GMs, we coordinated events in the different games by having a discussion between sessions about what had happened and how it influenced things in the game world.<br/><br/>There were a couple of sessions where the PCs met each other (maybe more, but I only remember two significant ones), one where the magi sent a diplomatic mission to make some kind of alliance with the vampires (this didn't go terribly well) and in the big final mission we got a bunch of guest players to be everyone from the King and his generals to time travelling magi from the future. That last session was epic and crazy.<br/><br/>We didn't really have to deal very much with rules conflicts (as I recall, we GMs just ad hoc decided how it would work when it came up, which wasn't too often). We may have made some guidelines for converting between the different magical resistance rules and how damage converted, but most other stuff could be done on the fly.

The AD&amp;D part mostly only nostalgically though.<br/>\nWe did a brief campaign with Anti-pool as the main OOC/story mechanic and DnD4E fights, which was a good mix.

I'm more thinking an economic or area control game than a wargame ala M44.  Jyhad/VtES as the "outer game" for a Vampire game is another nice fit, although I feel like there the players shouldn't see the large game, just because it will make it easier to keep track of everything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294124/#Comment_294124" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-20T21:26:50+00:00" title="September 20, 2010  9:26PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2010 9:30PM by Hans_c-o.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite><cite>Posted By: Brenton</cite><br/>We're playing a Burning Wheel game.

Seriously though, how do you do it, Brenton? Did you all convert stats/skills between the two games? Powers? Etc.? I'm genuinely curious for the deets on how this works at your table. Please indulge us! Thanks.<br/><br/>Sorry to hijack this thread for this comment.<br/><br/>It came about when 3 of the 5 players just could not grasp, after repeated tries, all of the intricacies of the Fight! system.  They got parts of it, but always grew frustrated when we tried to put everything together.  At one point, we tried using miniatures to help figure out positioning, and that was when one of the players asked why we weren't just using 4e to resolve the conflicts.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that none of the BW characters used any magic, so there isn't too much verisimilitude jarring happening.  To convert between the two systems, the players each made a 4e-legal version of their character.  There isn't really any hard conversions of stats, but the players paid a lot of attention to making the skills and other aspects of the 4e versions reflect the characteristics of the original BW characters.  We gauged the level based on the kinds of challenges the BW characters could overcome and the bell curves Luke describes for stats in BW.  While in 4e mode, players still have access to their artha pools (which have roughly statistically-equivalent effects), beliefs, and instincts.  Traits are modeled using either feats or additional features.  At the end of a combat, we'll note artha expenditures and estimate which skills should receive tests for the purposes of BW advancement.  As characters advance in BW, we note at what point it seems as though they have advanced the equivalent of a level in ability and then level-up the 4e characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294331/#Comment_294331" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T15:56:17+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  3:56PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Brenton, that's just the kind of system-translation I was curious about.

Because that's the second time I've heard that.<br/><br/>For my part, I'm just intrigued by the idea of a game with the Resistance before they got an ANIMa, hence Apoc World in the middle.<br/><br/>Here's my thoughts for the general story coming from going DRYH -&gt; Bliss Stage -&gt; Apocalypse World:<br/><br/>Your characters Awaken when the Bliss strikes - the story is about finding a way to fight back, with crashing being a definitive 'game over' as opposed to an almost-definitive one - you sleep, you Bliss, you're gone. Your pre-ANIMa resistance is going to show up here. If everybody goes down, than Game Over, man.<br/><br/>If one or more people survive long enough to get an ANIMa device working, then you transition to Bliss Stage. Multiple survivors from DRYH become multiple Resistance cells, leading you to choose more positive Hopes for the game. Again, full-on failure is on the table - if you establish that, in fact, there is no place for humanity in the future, then why bother?<br/><br/>If you do carve out a place for humanity with a chance for survival, then and only then do you break out the Apocalypse World. Because let's be honest, even if you do make a better civilization, defeat the aliens, and find a way to wake up the sleepers, the world is still going to be torn all to hell, and if you're all bought in for this delightful insane uber-campaign, you'll probably have resolved Hopes in a way that leads to the sort of Apocalypse World your group digs. And from that point, well, the MC follows the principles, you make your moves, and whatever happens, happens.<br/><br/>The level of commitment and buy-in for something like this is epic, but pull it off, and DAMN that'll be some fine gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294400/#Comment_294400" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-23T08:23:12+00:00" title="September 23, 2010  8:23AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gah, now I'm trying to figure out the dynamics of a Nobilis Anchors game using a hacked Burning Empires, with Deeds points turning into Miracle points for your Power.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294603/#Comment_294603" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-25T18:07:10+00:00" title="September 25, 2010  6:07PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read somewhere that a group played Lacuna and then a bunch of other games, culminating in a long-term Burning Wheel game.
