Nobody suspects a roe deer, they're sneaky like that...<br/><br/>A game of high adventure, where with sword, shield and spell you confront the monsters of the Netherdark, Limbo and the Inferno.<br/><br/>A lighthearted game. Not a dull or deadly serious game.<br/><br/>A game where you, the player, get to decide, as the mood takes you, whether you want Character or "Story". Is it a Roleplaying Game? Is it a Storygame? Nobody knows! And neither will you, until you play it!<br/><br/>Roll up your hero in minutes, and playtest the Implosion! RPG - you might be the first in the world!<br/><br/>Seriously, dude. I came up with the idea for this game on the 16th of January 2016, and in barely 3 weeks I have finished the 179-page PDF, including rudimentary formatting and proof-reading. I would like to say that I playtested it, but that would be a fib. By the way, when I say 179 pages, that's 12-point Arial font, US Trade size, so it's not a huge word count.<br/><br/>As yet there is no artwork. As yet there is no index. In fact, there are about 37 pages "missing" where artwork ought to be. (Otherwise it would be, um, 216 pages long...)<br/><br/>Come in at the beginning and make the game's history!<br/><br/>I want your no-punches-pulled feedback! I want it online and public! I want your Actual Play reports littering the forums of the online roleplaying world like turkey sandwiches after Christmas! Give me your premature reviews! Ejaculate your comments all over the Interwebz! I want the hype! I want the hate! I want the love! <br/><br/>Give it all to Implosion!<br/><br/>If you let me know you're interested, I can send you the 3MB PDF by e-mail or give you the private link to download it from Lulu. All I want is your commitment to play it and post your feedback in some form, somewhere!<br/><br/>I'm not really sure how PMs work on the Story-Games site but I'm sure we can figure something out if you're interested.<br/><br/>You can also get the character sheets in US Letter format. <br/><br/>Cheers                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451246/#Comment_451246" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-10T23:34:52+00:00" title="February 10, 2016 11:34PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be more distinctive, this is now called <b>Implodarc</b>; may the "story arc" implode! :-)<br/><br/>Could do with more playtesters if anyone else vaguely interested who hasn't been in touch yet.
