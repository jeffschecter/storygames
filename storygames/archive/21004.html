It is a great approach that has served us well for a decade or more. We've had people join that were not initially keen on facilitating, but by the time their turn came around (many weeks later) they were always comfortable with pitching something they liked. So I guess I'd say make this an expectation and then enthusiastically support everyone as they take the reins, whether they think of themselves as a "GM" or not.

I'm concerned about getting folks in that situation to commit to a long-running game, however.<br/><br/>**Of course** one of the goals here is to establish a group where we can take turns GMing. I'm not saying I <i>always</i> want to be the one running; I'm saying that when I *am* running, I'm sick of people flaking at the last second or doing similar things that simply make campaign play impossible.

You may be on to something!<br/><br/>However, my experience thus far has been, rather - and quite often - the opposite:<br/><br/>Newbies and "player-only" folks are often fun and engaged and open-minded. The newbies are keen and they will follow my lead without hewing to tradition. The "player-only" people I've met (not all of them, but some) are hardcore "inhabit my character" types, who get *really* engaged with the game and their characters. I like that, because in a Narrativist mode of play, they're just so <i>emotionally present</i>. That makes the game really fun for me to run.<br/><br/>In contrast, some of the people I've played with who are regularly GMs seem to approach gaming at a level of remove sometimes. I don't know why this is; one simple theory could be because they use a lot of "tricks" in their games, and so they might be more likely to look out for such "tricks" in other people's games?<br/><br/>I almost get the impression with some of them that they are playing <i>ironically</i>, quite in contrast to the newbies and hardcore players who are 100% engaged.<br/><br/>I suspect there are no hard rules about this, though - particularly if people have had opposite experiences!<br/><br/>I think your notes about commitment (flaking on sessions), whining, and so forth, are right on, however. I can easily imagine how someone who runs their own games could be more likely to respect what you do and, for instance, try harder not to miss sessions. Ultimately, though, it's the individual that matters. I use to play with a fellow who ran lots of games (and was a great GM). He would always show up so late to our games, that we actually started designing games and scenarios where one player could join in halfway through! It was the only way...<br/><br/>Interesting topic, in any case. Hmmm!<br/><br/>Edit: Thinking about this further, I *have* seen more traditional circles of gamers where there exists a somewhat "passive" player culture. In such an environment, there is a much more strict "segregation" of "people who only play" and "GMs" than there would be in a more "story game"-style culture. <br/><br/>I was involved with a Meetup group like this once, and, were I to go back to play with any of them, I think I would enjoy myself *much* more if I played with the people who identify as "GMs" (which I still find a bit funny, but there it is)... generally speaking.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm not sure where that leaves me. Like I said, it's food for thought for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460988/#Comment_460988" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-07T19:55:35+00:00" title="March  7, 2017  7:55PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2017 7:56PM by WarriorMonk.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, I noticed the opposite trend with my group: the more often one of us GMs, the worse players we become.<br/><br/>For one thing, we all have different ways to GM and after seeing how things work behind the screen we all develop an opinion about how it should be done and feel somewhat unease in each other's games.

I would also totally want a group heavy on commitment and proactive interest in delving into a serious campaign. I don't know if pre-selecting for GMing experience gives him that, though.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I have never been able to run a long (as in, 5+ sessions) campaign without either the group being quite small (like, 4 people) or the game accommodating casual participation from the non-GM players. Finding just three other people who were interested in some real hardcore play with e.g. Glorantha or Ars Magica or Pendragon or anything else requiring constant participation and proactive interest is not a trivial task even if you know many roleplayers with different tastes. In practice I find it likely that for most of us this fact shapes our gaming life quite a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461017/#Comment_461017" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-08T19:52:58+00:00" title="March  8, 2017  7:52PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very true!

I've found both of those very effective at reducing flake outs, and GM+3 is definitely my ideal for long-term play.<br/><br/>But what you're suggesting makes a lot of sense to me too. One of my eternal frustrations is when players don't learn the rules up to a certain level of fluency (I don't expect mastery, although it's nice, but I do want folks to be conversant in the aspects of a trad rule system that they're regularly interacting with). I've universally noticed that folks who regularly GM are more likely to make that effort. With a lot of the games I'm into (e.g., Ars Magica), it's basically a non-negotiable minimum for a campaign to work long-term. If I had a pool of potential players that contained a large enough percentage of regular GMs, I might very well take the same approach.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461030/#Comment_461030" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-09T00:51:42+00:00" title="March  9, 2017 12:51AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2017 12:51AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GMs in my group in non-GM roles:<br/><br/><b>Cons: </b>They may try to GM anyway.<br/><b>Pros: </b>They're more likely than most players to be sensitive to other concerns of the game and group beyond just playing their character.<br/><br/>The more the GM in question is equally experienced as player <i>and</i> GM, the greater the pros and the lesser the cons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461031/#Comment_461031" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-09T04:48:49+00:00" title="March  9, 2017  4:48AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting way to look at it.<br/><br/>It's entirely possible that all the people I'm thinking of who are "GMs" but I wouldn't particularly want in *my* game are people who pretty much ONLY ever GM. <br/><br/>(And of course it's possible to only be GMing games and yet to be a great player... but some of those "I only GM" people have gotten there by choice, and for good reasons - for instance, maybe no one liked playing with them, and so they stopped doing it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461042/#Comment_461042" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-09T14:43:25+00:00" title="March  9, 2017  2:43PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2017 2:45PM by WarriorMonk.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>WarriorMonk,<br/><br/>What do you mean by "losing what [you] felt was best from [your] style of GMing"? </blockquote>\nI was quite good at everything unrelated to math and rules, that's why I went most of the time to an almost freeform interpretation of the rules or used minimalistic rules. A few of my players are more into the math and rules side, so I went and studied the rules and keep checking them in-game to be sure we're using them right. It's not like it takes me more than 10-30 seconds of page flipping or checking my notes, but for me that's enough to find my usual momentum somewhat weakened.<br/><br/>I've been checking magician acts lately on youtube, most of them from the Penn &amp; Teller's Fool Us" show and it's interesting how the illusion breaks quite a bit when you know a bit of how the magic is done. You see the gestures used for misdirection, notice how and where things are prepared, when the magician is making some additional moves or buying time to fix the trick preparation. At some point you even get part of what Penn says to the magician on the stage when he's found out how he did his trick. (he usually makes a few gestures or drops a word or two that only the performer will get, to not ruin their act by revealing everything bout it)<br/><br/>I feel a bit it's the same for GMs as players. And the more time I'm taking fixing my act, the more obvious are the mirrors and the smoke use. Sure, the same as Penn and Teller, they are more considerate to every aspect of the magician's act. They value not only the trick but how it's presented on the stage, the charisma and personality projected by the performer, how skilled he/she is on misdirection, forcing people to take choices, sleigh of hand, etc. <br/><br/>So of course a GM will be a better audience in that aspect, but as proven in the Penn &amp; Teller show, that makes them harder to impress. For me that means that I have to study the rules again and again until I drill them in my mind enough that I don't need to keep so much notes about it. Also, focus on making a quite resumed prep and memorizing it so I can improvise better around it and not need to look back on my notes or take too long rolling random tables while playing.<br/><br/>My goal is going back again to the point that, whenever players ask me a question, I don't need to break eye contact to answer them, nor take longer than 10 seconds when checking my notes, making up random stuff nor taking notes about whatever me or the players have just made up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461048/#Comment_461048" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-09T19:40:33+00:00" title="March  9, 2017  7:40PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not just put someone else in charge of the rules?

(Particularly if you use a variation where the GM doesn't hand out 1-3 dice, as many do.) I think it frees up a GM to do what she does best.<br/><br/>Alternately, why put so much pressure on yourself? Give yourself room to breathe and look things up - quite likely the players do this sometimes, too. It's hardly a game-breaker unless you're maintaining a frenzied pace.<br/><br/>Of course, though, it's nice when you don't have to slow down to look things up. Pick a game which lets you do that, and/or delegate the bits you can't remember.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461055/#Comment_461055" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-09T22:56:37+00:00" title="March  9, 2017 10:56PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still adjusting my GMing anyway. Right now I like to let players handle their side of the rules. They have all their character and levelling up options, I'm not even reading those anymore. We got a couple rules lawyers taking charge of that part and helping newcomers so I'm free from that part of the game. Some players do make me go search for the player rules from time to time either because it seems obvious they are misinterpretating the rules in their favour or just don't know them very well. That's okay, it happens from time to time.<br/><br/>But there are things like the combat rules that are supposed to be handled by both the players and I as a common language, and I can't afford to leave things to other players there.

You need someone who's not trying to take over the GM role -- note that "trying" doesn't mean actively trying. Some of us just have habits that are challenging to break. You also need someone good at getting to the heart of it, e.g., quickly saying, "This is what the rules say."<br/><br/>When I ran Eternal Lies, Aviatrix was the person I turned to for rules questions. I still do this with Dracula Dossier, but I'm also likely to be telling folks, "Okay, remember to reread these pages of the rulebook, because you can do some really cool things with this, and I'm not going to remember in play."<br/><br/>When I ran a playtest of one of the Deadlands scenarios, back before it was done with Savage Worlds, I had Josh be in charge of the rules. It didn't help -- I still wound up hating the complexity. I can play any version of Deadlands, but I'm highly dubious about my ability to run the thing, even with a rules person.<br/><br/>When we playtested Feng Shui 2, Josh and another player both had my back on the rules. Josh said, "Okay, get out your tiny post-it arrows and make the following chart for initiative. Trust me -- you will have a much easier time running combat this way." And, he was correct. The playtest was a bit bumpy, but that was due to a combination of, hey, playtest rules, not fully polished, and the fact that, while I love the setting, I'm never the ideal GM of a game that combat heavy in that way. This was, of course, part of the reason I was the GM for the playtest, as we could confirm it was at least possible for me to do this.<br/><br/>At a convention, I think that having a rules person works best when this isn't a volunteer player, but someone who's done this for you before and who is there specifically for that purpose. The other can work well, but if you can eliminate the variables, so much the better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461068/#Comment_461068" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-10T05:47:55+00:00" title="March 10, 2017  5:47AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/StoneTharp">@StoneTharp</a> and I will be starting up a game of <i>Beyond the Wall</i> soon with another friend of ours as the GM; both he and I know the game better (StoneTharp knows it better than me, but I have run it).

I want to write some things down while they're all still fresh in my mind.<br/><br/>The truth is, it's really just one player who's making me feel this way, at the current moment\u2014though all three of the other players have at least a little GMing experience. (The problem player does as well, but only a little, only one-shots, and it's never gone great for her, AFAICT.)<br/><br/>Here is what is happening with this player:<br/><br/>-Cannot tolerate failure. I warned my players before tonight's session started that something very dangerous and bad was coming for them, there was a high likelihood of failure / defeat and possibly even party death. (There were in the end no fatalities, but the bad guys beat them up quite hard, and the main villain got away.) I also offered to incorporate a deus ex machina into the scheme if things got bad. All three of the other players said they didn't want it; this player said she would call for it at the time if she felt it was needed. She did not do so during the big fight, but was clearly deeply unhappy about the outcome of the session.<br/><br/>-Runs her character off an iPad, but it's a constant source of frustration, such that it increases her overall anxiety and frustration during the session. Plus, she very often has her head buried in it, and is constantly being asked to be caught up on what's going on in the game.<br/><br/>-Cannot tolerate my strict, consistent enforcement of the rules. The biggest moment of frustration with that sort of thing tonight was when I informed her she couldn't use <i>Hold Person</i> on a fey creature, but similar instances have come up repeatedly.<br/><br/>-Part of the issue is that she doesn't really have the rules mastery or tactical acumen necessary to run a spellcaster in 5E.<br/><br/>She did say after tonight's session that she wanted to make a new character, which is a great idea, though I suspect the real issue is that she just hates the way I run games, or at least this game*. She's the (IME rare) player type who genuinely does not enjoy feeling any sense of danger or challenge in RPGs. And, as I said, she seems personally affronted by having to follow the rules.<br/><br/>It's probably the one thing that, as a GM, I don't know how to deal with. For the immediate moment, I think the best thing to do is to have her make her new character, and see how things go for a session or two, but stay prepared to possibly have the difficult conversation of "you probably just shouldn't play in games I run."<br/><br/>*But even if we were playing, say, Spirit of the Century, I think she'd chafe\u2014a lot\u2014during the rare moments of failure, or when I, say, reminded her that she has to have Fate points available to activate certain stunts, etc..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461248/#Comment_461248" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-22T04:40:22+00:00" title="March 22, 2017  4:40AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds tough, Matt!

I would be very curious to hear how she sees this problem/situation - you never know, sometimes there are surprises lurking behind the surface!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461253/#Comment_461253" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-22T07:31:25+00:00" title="March 22, 2017  7:31AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, it's more what happens in the normal games that can be a bit hard to take, and I don't want to lose my understanding or patience with it. There's a sort of take-for-granted attitude that can pop up with veteran players who haven't DM:ed in a while or haven't DM:ed in the way that I do. Playing with non-gamers or playing with all-GM:s, this happens way less. I want to keep my patience with the take-for-granted attitude that some players might have. Because I do understand where they're coming from, too. They're working from their own experience and what they believe will make the games better for them, and I want to keep listening to them and learning from them. (Albeit not always giving them what they think they want.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

The game will stay as it is, <i>Hold Person</i> won't start working on Fey for example (hey, I didn't even know that it didn't \u2014 how can't it, it uses cold iron as a material component? [That's a rhetorical question directed towards the MM writers, not you \u2014 I know they don't have the "humanoid" tag]). Just love&amp;accept her, let her be there, ask the other players (when she's out of ear shot) to help her. If she learns to like the game, she will stay, if she doesn't, she will leave.<br/><br/>One of my best players when it comes to instigating interesting stuff in the game took a really long time learning good tactics or mastering the rules. And that was fine.<br/><br/>The one thing I would try to put the kibosh on, is her using other apps on her tablet that distract her.

This sort of distractions can really impact how we interact with each other in a way that we don't realize ourselves.<br/><br/>On the other hand, some people just want to hang out, contribute a little bit or nothing, and multitask with some comics or some apps. I would be careful about having more than one person of that category at the table and of course, they can be very disruptive. I usually have a "no phones" policy \u2014 my rule is: you can take calls but don't sit and text and do FB and stuff. Having character info on the gadgets makes it not as clear cut, and we sometimes look up rulings on the phone as well.\n<blockquote>Also, ask her directly what it is she expects from the game, what she wants. Be honest and kind.<br/>She may think she's signalling it, but you can't read her mind.</blockquote>\nTo be clear, I'm giving the opposite advice in some ways, to not overreact to her expectations. Play the game honestly and consistently. "Build it and they will come." And give her permission to have her emotional reaction to it, especially when things are going bad in the game or spells she had thought would work don't. Don't give in, but let her <i>feel</i> what she feels about it. There's no need to invalidate that. It's perfectly understandable to get miffed when (I know I'm returning to this example a lot, but it's synecdochical, to be generalized from) a <i>Hold Person</i> isn't as applicable as you thought. Doesn't mean that you really benefit in the long run from having the spell changed. It's just a reaction, not an appeal to universal law. It's OK to have emotions and some of us, myself included, are a bit more emotional.<br/><br/>Of course, allow her to quit the game if and when she so wishes. But, no need to run her out of the game prematurely either. Again, "build it and they will come" philosophy.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461258/#Comment_461258" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-22T08:39:25+00:00" title="March 22, 2017  8:39AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd ask <i>all</i> the players what they expected from the game, do a debrief about what works, doesn't work.

I just want to be clear that I <i>am</i> giving partially opposite advice, so that these two opposite ideas (Tores and mine) don't get muddled together. Then Matt (and any other GM:s who are reading, now or later) can decide on their own which of the two ways to go, or try both in different groups, or find some sort of synthesis or dialectical balance between the two approaches. But, I want my approach to be completely clear, so people can consider any pros and cons of both ideas.<br/><br/>My reasoning is partially based in when you ask people what they want from the game you set up the expectation that they are going to get that from the game, and partially based in the hard-earned experience that it's easy to over-react to emotional reactions. That emotions can have their space and that it's fine, it doesn't necessarily mean things will have to change. I play the video game Cave Noire a lot and sometimes it's very frustrating when I press the wrong button and fall in a pit and die and I get sad, angry, whatever. Doesn't mean I won't keep playing (maybe after a little break). I just let the emotions have their room.<br/><br/>If someone is coming with feedback, of course listen to it and take it into consideration. If you're doing A and they're asking for B, maybe the right thing to do is C. (It might also be to do B, or to keep doing A.)<br/><br/>Also, my advice only applies to how the game is working in and of itself. In this case, rule enforcement, and challenge level. Basic "DM merit badges" parameters. If someone is uncomfortable with things around the game, such as the environment, jargon, harassment etc, that's an immediate cause of concern.\n<blockquote>And ban electronics. They're useful for looking things up, but distract otherwise.</blockquote>\nCan't argue with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461260/#Comment_461260" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-22T09:12:01+00:00" title="March 22, 2017  9:12AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2017 9:34AM by 2097.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I have a bias here; if the question was about some super illusionistic linear event-to-event RPG I would be "Oh, of course change it, go sandbox, go sandbox!".

I think the "worst outcome" is a player not leaving, but also continuing to both not have fun and to make the game way, way less fun for me to GM, and somewhat less fun for the other players.

Just radical acceptance and try to hide any judgmental thoughts that pop up.

Try to convey that as subtly and non-dorkily, non-euphemistically as possible (or, if that's not possible, just stay neutral).<br/><br/>Now, that's way easier said than done.

That thinking and working in a more short-sighted fashion can be better. Not necessarily second-by-second, but hour-by-hour. How do I make the next hour the best it could be? How do I stay true to my "Dungeon Master vow" without invalidating any of the players' experience or emotional reactions?<br/><br/><br/>Taking a step back, this topic has begun to be more about  "How to handle this particular player?" than "Is it time for me to find a new, all-GM group?", which, while the former is a much more interesting topic for me, might not be what you wanted right now.

Is it still the party that's in the driver's seat, having a home base, going to dungeons etc? I've found that that can take a lot of the load from my own shoulders. If they get killed by 3d6 wolves over and over again, well, they blame the deadly forest, they blame themselves for spending too much time out there, rather than me.

It's a <b>Ghost Jar</b>. A magical glass jar with an unsettling blue light that you store in a safe place. There's a ring in the jar; you take it out and wear it. If you do, when you would "die", you reappear at the <b>Ghost Jar</b>'s location and you now have exactly 5 hp. The first thing you notice as you "die" is the clinking sound of the ring falling into the glass again. Then you open your eyes, you're beside the jar, groggy perhaps after the astral journey. You can fish out the ring again and do it all over again. Any clothes or bags physically on you are teleported with you, as well as weapons you're physically touching, but it's pretty common to have things knocked out of your hands as you pass out. (1 on 1d4 chance you drop everything you're carrying in your hands, like chests, swords etc, alternatively make it a DC 6 no-mod save on a d20 to keep a firm grip)  Any donkeys or other pack animals are not teleported with you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461270/#Comment_461270" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-22T17:04:49+00:00" title="March 22, 2017  5:04PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a bit of a hybrid between strict railroad and strictly linear--which of course I made clear to my players at the outset.

This player genuinely doesn't want to be responsible for making the choices, precisely because choices often have consequences, and she wants gaming to be consequence-free. There's nothing inherently wrong with that\u2014I know it sounds judgy\u2014but it's not something I can provide, at least not in anything resembling a D&amp;D5E framework.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461271/#Comment_461271" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-22T17:30:00+00:00" title="March 22, 2017  5:30PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, stick with the hex crawl and playing to find out, playing for emergence.

So, no wonder she snaps at you. She can totally handle one source of frustration and still have fun, but two at the same time is too much for anybody.<br/><br/>-Even if she has realized you're just enacting the rules and letting those produce new situations and block the players who don't interact with them on the right way because the logic of the setting demands so, it's worse for her; it's the same as being angry at her app for not working right, except that she feels that she should be able to blame you -the person in control of the fun- for ruining the fun for her, but she can't because you're not actually controlling anything at the table. That's probably twice as frustrating as the app from her point of view.<br/><br/>-When I started GMing and for a loooong time, illusionism was my default way to go. Dunno if I learned it from the GMs I played with or just came up with it because fear of giving a poor experience to my group of players, but it certainly took years for me to understand and finally get other ways of GMing. I'm wondering if she is in the same situation.<br/><br/>-It was the same for the old school DMing style. I hated it to my guts for a long time and went playing power fantasy games for a while. Then I had a hard time trying to play PF on a campaign that I didn't enjoy too much, despite going and ending quite well. Mostly I couldn't help but feel powerless, blocked and stressed by the character math, not ruining the build and learning all the rules, despite our GM not enforcing the rules too much nor going old school on us. It finally receded when I finally got to read 5e and a lot of stuff about OSR here on SG. She may have strong feelings against OSR but still wanting to give it a try, and still not getting the fun part about it. Again, it took several people, a lot of reading and various different interesting games until I got what OSR was about, and yet today that doesn't make it my favourite way of playing.<br/><br/>So my guess is that despite you all being open and talking about the game there are still several misunderstandings, too much stress on the table and you both are trying to play different games. Hopefully you can still tackle it talking a bit more and going deeper into the matter. Perhaps being more open about what exactly you both feel during the session will give you a better clue on what's going wrong than the ones I'm putting here. Best luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461284/#Comment_461284" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-22T21:55:20+00:00" title="March 22, 2017  9:55PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, I meant "linear" and "sandbox".<br/><br/>But I maintain that "play to find out what happens" is *not* what this person wants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461286/#Comment_461286" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-22T22:16:02+00:00" title="March 22, 2017 10:16PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The idea behind my thinking w/ putting/keeping the party in control was that any blame for what happens will be even further from you.

Your particular game, Matt, while obviously not an ideal match for such goals, may be the best place she knows to pursue them.  I might expect her to voluntarily leave when she has a better option, but not before.<br/><br/>I think Sandra's Ghost Jar is brilliant, but if that doesn't work for logistical reasons, I would suggest letting her play an character whose relationship to the adventure is different than the other characters'.  Like, let her play Q from Star Trek, who has a whole separate life outside of the Enterprise's enterprises, and is completely invulnerable, but nevertheless can take a keen interest in any given set of adventurous goings-on.  Let her play an intangible ghost, prankster fairy, idle demigod, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461290/#Comment_461290" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-23T03:10:18+00:00" title="March 23, 2017  3:10AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an excellent idea.

Basically, I made getting a full long rest much more difficult (though not impossible!) than the default while traveling in the wilderness. The reasoning for this is as follows:<br/><br/>-5E's combat / challenge system is designed around the idea of <b>6-8</b> encounters between long rests. Not all of them need to be fights, or even expend resources, though there needs to be at least the possibility of expending resources.<br/><br/>-If every night they sleep a normal 8 hours in the wilderness counts as a long rest, then I have to fill the game with boring trash fights / random encounters or the PCs will be at full HP and spell slots every single encounter\u2014which trust me, is really boring and does actually wreck 5E's math.<br/><br/>Of course, I announced all my house rules via email several weeks before the game began and before characters were finalized. She simply didn't read that email. So when I alluded to it the first time it came up, she flipped out. Which was, you know... kind of hard for me to take seriously.<br/><br/>The next week, when we talked one-on-one about it before the game began, I very carefully explained my reasons for implementing it, and she said she would tentatively accept them, but of course since then she's whined and moaned every time the group has slept but not gotten the benefits of a full long rest.<br/><br/>And of course, she certainly hasn't come up with an alternative suggestion for how to handle long resting in a wilderness-travel-focused game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461297/#Comment_461297" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-23T04:42:23+00:00" title="March 23, 2017  4:42AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2017 4:42AM by Paul_T.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461299/#Comment_461299" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-23T06:13:03+00:00" title="March 23, 2017  6:13AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, unless there were compelling social reasons to the contrary, I'd just stop playing with her.

There are rest-changing rules), or a rule of my own design. <br/><br/>The reaction I've gotten range from outright refusal (like, I've really really wanted to try out the "take turns deciding on what scene to do" from Hillfolk in D&amp;D, but to no avail), dissatisfied confusion (my favorite option in the DMG is "Targets in Areas of Effect", which we now all dig but it was an uphill battle trying to convey what it meant and why it was good) or just them not noticing/appreciating it (like my own "Rules for finding someone", which produced good games but to little fanfare since it was so invisible on the player's side).<br/><br/>And, regardless of the reaction (unless it's positive), it's always much harder on me than if they hate some spell or something that's part of the game as is. In this case, if she had been mad at <i>Hold Person</i>, I could go "Hehe, yeah, that's dumb. [Pause, then sternly:] But that's how it is." But if she's mad at some rule I invented, I'm way more affected. It's a mix of "why don't they get how awesome it is?" and "ohmigod what if they're right" and a hundred other fears at once.<br/><br/>However, when it's about some rule in the DMG, that's something I'm quick to point out. "It's an option in the DMG" has given me a mix of reactions from immediate approval and adoption, like the "cleave" rule to buff martials or, surprisingly, the "lingering injuries" rule (which is all downside for them), to reluctance but acceptance after a few sessions (the aforementioned "TiAoE") or reluctant acceptance but to much greater consternation (my removal of 70% of the skill system, and, weirdly, my <i>non</i>-inclusion of the popular but imo horribly designed DMG option "flanking").<br/><br/><br/>In this case, if you are straight up using the rest variant "Gritty Realism" from DMg p 267, or your changes to that variant are all straight upside for the party or strictly clariity increase, that's good for you because it can be a big source of CYA something you can point to.<br/><br/>I dunno. It took my home group a long time to learn to not nova as much but they're good about it now. At the con game I ran early March one of the casters went exxtremeny nova prone so they long rested a lot. It's a risk they take b/c they had to make encounter checks throughout the night. (There is a rule in there that you can only long rest once in a 24-hour period.) I just shrugged it off. It's unfair to the champions, warlocks etc but it was just a one shot. They'll probably die anyway, I thought. It's been my experience that no matter what gamebreaking shenanigans the party is up to, they'll probably die suddenly anyway. We had a long-lived warlock with some AC shenanigans right after we started allowing Feats &amp; Multiclassing. Who died from a mind blasting spell. I didn't change the adventure or the opposition in any way, I had trust in the book (Curse of Strahd) to have a variety of challenges so I didn't fret about it. Again, I dunno. I've been considering those "Gritty" rest rules for vome campaigns.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, the <b>Ghost Jar</b>\u2026 I said "if you wish". If you don't, then pass it on. I tried to include a couple of features deliberately: 1. Minimal impact on rest of party. 2. Has opt-out for player (don't wear the ring) or DM (mess with the jar). 3. Minimally impacts the actual fighting (more safety net than in-combat buff). 4. Has Q-factor (the Merricat-like strict insistence on 5HP) proving its a bonafide Magical item<br/><br/>But yes, there's a downside: D&amp;D is a game of stakes and consequences and that's where a lot of the edge, appeal and addiction comes from, even over many video games. The permadeath. This item significantry dilutes that. (But it sounds like that's what she wants -- risk is fun but it's been like drinking from the firehose for her, too much risk &amp; danger) But, it's still a big hassle to die, even with it. And, it's something that one could stop using after a while.<br/><br/>Even with all that, yeah, I can see how it could be counterproductive to my other stated goal of keeping the game honest, keeping the edge, keeping the "gambling"-like cycle of risk/reward that OSR produces. I tried to keep those in mind when I designed the <b>Ghost Jar</b> (or rather, I stole it from the bottled fairies in Link to the Past -- they save you when you die but you still really don't want to die even if you have one. And, they're way more generous since they revive you then and there, not back at the inn three hexes over, or, in that grove over there or wherever you stashed the jar).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461301/#Comment_461301" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-23T06:21:40+00:00" title="March 23, 2017  6:21AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2017 8:11AM by 2097.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not even sure I'd take this jar option myself, if I was in your position as DM.

So, no wonder she snaps at you. She can totally handle one source of frustration and still have fun, but two at the same time is too much for anybody.<br/><br/>-Even if she has realized you're just enacting the rules and letting those produce new situations and block the players who don't interact with them on the right way because the logic of the setting demands so, it's worse for her; it's the same as being angry at her app for not working right, except that she feels that she should be able to blame you -the person in control of the fun- for ruining the fun for her, but she can't because you're not actually controlling anything at the table. That's probably twice as frustrating as the app from her point of view.<br/><br/>-When I started GMing and for a loooong time, illusionism was my default way to go. Dunno if I learned it from the GMs I played with or just came up with it because fear of giving a poor experience to my group of players, but it certainly took years for me to understand and finally get other ways of GMing. I'm wondering if she is in the same situation.<br/><br/>-It was the same for the old school DMing style. I hated it to my guts for a long time and went playing power fantasy games for a while. Then I had a hard time trying to play PF on a campaign that I didn't enjoy too much, despite going and ending quite well. Mostly I couldn't help but feel powerless, blocked and stressed by the character math, not ruining the build and learning all the rules, despite our GM not enforcing the rules too much nor going old school on us. It finally receded when I finally got to read 5e and a lot of stuff about OSR here on SG. She may have strong feelings against OSR but still wanting to give it a try, and still not getting the fun part about it. Again, it took several people, a lot of reading and various different interesting games until I got what OSR was about, and yet today that doesn't make it my favourite way of playing.<br/><br/>So my guess is that despite you all being open and talking about the game there are still several misunderstandings, too much stress on the table and you both are trying to play different games. Hopefully you can still tackle it talking a bit more and going deeper into the matter. Perhaps being more open about what exactly you both feel during the session will give you a better clue on what's going wrong than the ones I'm putting here.

Let's work something out so that everybody can have fun."<br/><br/>In my experience, most of the time, conflicts in the game don't come from one person deliberately trying to ruin everybody's good time but from some other thing that needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>With that in mind, here's how I would handle it.<br/><br/>I'd give myself some time before the session starts to take her aside and say, "Hey, I need to ask you about something regarding the game. Do you mind hearing me out for a couple of minutes?"<br/><br/>If she says no, I'd say, "I understand. Unfortunately, this means I can't continue to play with you because I need to be able to address things that are happening in the game."<br/><br/>Then I'd thank her for her time and participation then wish her good night and a safe trip home.<br/><br/>Now, if she says yes, I'd tell her, point-blank, "[Name], it seems that you're not having much fun in this campaign. I've been trying to find a middle ground between the vision I have for the game and your needs as a player, but nothing I've tried seems to be working. Do you still want to play this game, or are you looking for a different gaming experience?"<br/><br/>If she says no, again, I'd thank her for her time and participation then wish her a good night and a safe trip home.<br/><br/>If she says she has to think about it, I'd tell her to feel free to take this session off and come back next time (or not). If she doesn't come back, the game goes on without her. If she returns, I'd let her have her treasure and XP and not penalize her for skipping a session because taking a step back to reassess is something that makes the game fun for everyone.<br/><br/>If she says yes, I'd tell her, "That's good to know because some of the things you say and do at the table make it seem like you'd rather be anywhere else."<br/><br/>Then I'd describe the specific things she does, how it affects the game, and how that makes me feel. I'd focus strictly on her behavior and its effects. I would not try to tell her what she thinks and feels because I can't stand that when people act like they can read my mind. (Wanna see me get angry? Tell me how angry I am and insist that I'm angry when I tell you I'm not.)<br/><br/>Then I'd ask her, "I need your help to turn this around. How can we change this?"<br/><br/>If she has good ideas and offers something I can work with, great! This is the outcome I'd be waiting for. I'd want her to admit her real issue and offer options.<br/><br/>Regardless of her answer, once she's said her piece, I'd ask, "May I offer a couple of suggestions?" or, "Could you do me a favor or two?"<br/><br/>If she says yes, I'd say, "Having your phone/iPad/whatever out while we game can be a bit distracting. Why don't we try putting away the electronics at the table? Just for this session to see how it goes?"<br/><br/>(If she needs her mobile device to keep track of the math or something like that, I'd offer her another way to do that.)<br/><br/>If she refuses, I'd thank her for her time and participation then wish her a good night and a safe trip home.<br/><br/>Once I got the yes about putting away the electronics, I'd thank her then say, "Another thing to try this time: if I make a ruling that seems off to you, do you mind waiting until we take a break to bring it up? And can you do it without raising your voice?"<br/><br/>If she says yes, I'd thank her and say, "Let's try this. I think this will work."<br/><br/>If she forgets or slides back into the habits that make the game frustrating and disheartening to run, I'd gently remind her.<br/><br/>At the end of the session, I'd thank her for trying my suggestions then ask her, point-blank, "Do you think this will work in the long term?"<br/><br/>If she says no or keeps doing the things you've stated you don't like, I'd thank her for her time and participation then wish her a good night and a safe trip home.<br/><br/>(Noticing a pattern here?)<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461381/#Comment_461381" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-25T08:38:35+00:00" title="March 25, 2017  8:38AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Another thing to try this time: if I make a ruling that seems off to you, do you mind waiting until we take a break to bring it up?</blockquote>\nThat goes a bit too far, I think. Having buy-in for rulings make the whole game feel more meaningful and real and if players bite their tongue when they think (right or wrong) that something's bad, they might lose their belief in the game and its world. That doesn't mean to have long arguments at the table but to have a "Is that really right?" from a player answered by either a quick "Ah, you're right, my mistake" or a "Yes, that's how it is!" can add so much to the tension, believability, stakes, and again buy-in at the table. For me one of the common things someone asks is "Did you miss my turn?" and I or someone say "Yeah, you cast that spell, remember?" or (more rarely) "Ah, sorry, you're right" is valuable. Having the whole table as co-arbitors of the rules (with the DM as final say) has been interesting, sometimes frustrating but it has caused great things. It felt like they could legitimately take down that dragon or get TPK:ed by Baba Yaga rather than it being caused by DM bullshit. We're interacting with the game, with the system, with the dice and the books. It feels neutral, grounded, more real. This isn't aimed towards Matt because I know he runs 5e by the book already.<br/><br/>In one of the examples it was an unusual spell interaction ("fey" don't count as "person" for Hold Person due to implications of the monster tag system \xad\u2014 they don't have "humanoid") and in the other it was some contentious house rules [that I happened to think were very good] that hit harder against casters. House rules are often a source of disagreement and I've often wished my group would've given some of them more of a chance before vetoing them. (Sounds weird that players could "veto" something? But, it depends on what the rule is, right? Some rules the DM can just do or not do as they wish. Like "Targets in Areas of Effect" I can just say "OK, it hits two of them" and if they start arguing "But it's a cone they should be in the line of fire" I can say "Nope, only two were hit". I can just do it. But if it's a house rule for something I want the players to do or not do, like the alternate encumbrance system I proposed, they can just go "Nope, not going to do that". Or for that matter character sheets. Always get great feedback at cons for my custom sheets but my home players have nixed them. Hometown prophecy doesn't pay...)\n<blockquote>And can you do it without raising your voice?</blockquote>\nThis OTOH is of course important. Matt doesn't deserve to be snapped at, and that was really heartbreaking to hear. It's really hard to bring up in a constructive way that doesn't make people defensive, or, when they inevitably do get defensive, it's hard to not get caught up in acting angry or snapping back. <a href="http://dbtselfhelp.com/html/ie_handout_8.html" rel="nofollow">Asking for things well is really difficult.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461391/#Comment_461391" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-25T12:51:14+00:00" title="March 25, 2017 12:51PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We talked, it was productive, we're going to both make some changes / try some things and reevaluate in about two sessions. The big takeaway for me was that it's fine for me to "neutrally GM a harsh world," but that I need to do more, tonally, to separate myself as a person from that world and its rules. That's totally reasonable and I agreed to it. I put a lot of demands on her: that she eat lunch on game day, not just dinner at the cafe where we game, that she read Chapter 8 of the PHB so she doesn't think I'm just making shit up when it comes to wilderness adventuring, and in general really making some effort to learn the mechanics. One thing I agreed to that I don't feel great about, and that I wouldn't have done for a stranger (but this is someone I've known for a long time and who is closely tied to my social circles): text her when there's an important game-related email so she doesn't miss it.<br/><br/>We talked a lot about how the thing that seems to provoke the most negative emotional reactions in her is being blind-sided by the rules, but that on a certain level she *has* to take responsibility for that by learning them. This, along with certain other things (the iPad thing), was very hard for her to hear, but she ultimately was able to accept them with reasonable good grace.<br/><br/>The big thing that I'm still quite dubious about: she claims to be okay with a harsh game world, with character failure, etc. I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, obviously, but I really don't buy it. We'll see, though: at the very least, she committed to being okay with those things, which gives me more solid footing on which to address any future problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Green" title="Green"><img alt="Green" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Green">Green</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461395/#Comment_461395" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-25T15:51:33+00:00" title="March 25, 2017  3:51PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's good to know.<br/><br/>There was a give and take, and a stated commitment, on her part, to hold up her end of making gaming fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461396/#Comment_461396" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-25T16:04:39+00:00" title="March 25, 2017  4:04PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whew!

I've tried to emulate that at times, but I can't really enjoy GMing without mustering up some passion which I inevitably express.  My ultimate ideal solution was to basically be on the players' and characters' team re: options, but to treat the world itself as already established and outside my control.  But Delve and OSR don't have the same rules presence of 5E, so I dunno how much of all that is relevant.

I'll be curious to hear how it all pans out! It is possible, after all, that she's putting on a "brave face" because she doesn't want to admit to her true preferences (I'm reading into this a little, but I think that's what you might be suspecting), in which case she won't have much fun anyway.<br/><br/>Dave's point about tone is absolutely right. I really enjoyed playing some D&amp;D with Eero a while back, because, while the world was deadly (and most of our characters died), he always explained his approach and made it clear that, while he wasn't going to pull any punches, he was on our side and we were in this together.<br/><br/>Perhaps there's some kind of lesson in that - setting things up as extremely hard and challenging gives the GM room, in some cases, to constantly err on the side of the characters/players.<br/><br/>There's probably an art to making bad outcomes and dangerous situations feel like they couldn't have gone any other way, so that it feels inevitable and unquestionable.<br/><br/>Matt, did she bring up any particular examples of what rubbed her the wrong way? After all, we've played together and I can't exactly imagine you gloating senselessly over a defeat you inflicted on the players. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461403/#Comment_461403" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-25T18:04:04+00:00" title="March 25, 2017  6:04PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the amazing news, Matt!

But, as Matt's acquaintance points out, the tones can get pretty tangled and it's easy to mess it up and seem cruel.<br/><br/>An easy rule of thumb, with some exceptions but as a good baseline, is that when things seem to go very poorly for the party, that's a time to convey the sympathy (the sympathy that's always there in your heart, you like the players after all) and make it clear that you're on their side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461409/#Comment_461409" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-25T19:02:29+00:00" title="March 25, 2017  7:02PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know about that! <br/><br/>"Hey, this is Dracula.

It's what helps the game avoid problems like we're seeing in this thread (although it sounds like it wouldn't have been *enough* in this case).<br/><br/>However, I also prefer in-character dialogue. When I wrote this:\n<blockquote>If I'm playing Rognar, and I'm really mad at you, I might snarl and say some strong words [...]</blockquote>\n...that's where the in-character dialogue would go. I just didn't think it would be necessary to illustrate that with an example. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I don't see any contradiction there - I can play out a scene fully in-character and then make some commentary about it afterwards. Much in the same way that you might say, "Woof! That was a tough fight. We're lucky we're not using encumbrance rules in this game!" - or whatever other thing.<br/><br/>I can only imagine it not being possible in a LARP or other attempt at a "full immersion experience" - I've yet to witness an RPG table group play without any side chatter. The idea is to remember to occasionally comment on what's happening during those side chatter bits. It helps everyone remember that we're friends and we're "on the same team", which is particularly useful in a game where things might go awry or there is some serious adversity (whether player vs. player, player vs. GM, or whatever else).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461426/#Comment_461426" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-25T22:39:48+00:00" title="March 25, 2017 10:39PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2017 10:40PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of my nastiest NPCs have accents or other speech particulars that distinguish them from me.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461429/#Comment_461429" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-25T23:40:31+00:00" title="March 25, 2017 11:40PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That also helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461434/#Comment_461434" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-26T04:38:03+00:00" title="March 26, 2017  4:38AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It is possible, after all, that she's putting on a "brave face" because she doesn't want to admit to her true preferences (I'm reading into this a little, but I think that's what you might be suspecting), in which case she won't have much fun anyway.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Matt, did she bring up any particular examples of what rubbed her the wrong way?

Though clever fictional positioning is more likely to lead to Advantage than actually lowering the DC, the latter is possible under certain circumstances.<br/><br/>I am finding 10/15/20 to be a bit clunky. I'm thinking of adding in 13 and 18 as intermediate difficulty grades for skill checks. In a way it might things harder to do this, because I'd have more possibilities, but on the other hand, it would also allow me to occasionally adjust things down one grade without handing out a +25 percentage point bonus to the probability of success.<br/><br/>Let's think this through a bit more. A Medium difficulty task is DC 15; anything other than that is a deviation from the baseline. Maybe I should just use something MG-like: if there is one mitigating factor, DC lowers to 13; if two, DC=10. Same thing in reverse for DCs 18 and 20. I'll post some common mitigating factors, by skill, in my next post. But I think this could end up working well, and increase transparency to boot.<br/><br/>BTW, getting back to the original theme of this thread*: I do think the other three players all having some more GMing experience and/or rules knowledge helped them more quickly intuit my thought processes behind DC-setting, which is part of why they were never bothered, whether things were hard or easy.<br/><br/>I do have one other immediate concern with this player; I'm almost hesitant to give voice to it lest I make it happen, but it's weighing heavily on me. After we met on Friday, we exchanged some emails based on some things we talked about. There's something really important that she has to follow up on with me before Tuesday\u2014I specifically said it was something I didn't want to take up table time working out, and she agreed.

But that's a decision I've had some cause to regret. It can look very arbitary. Hence my wish to go back to "15 or what's written". OTOH some things are so <i>clearly</i> 20, 10 or even 5.<br/><br/>BTW, when I determined my written prep I usually did 15 + 4dF (and I make the roll as I'm stocking the dungeon). This because I used to rely heavily on passives (passive perception but also other passive skills) and I don't want a particular value to be a clear watershed.<br/><br/>I didn't do this for my latest game, instead making a judgement call as the players encountered everything (but, of course, decided &amp; stated the DC before the roll). But, having the DC completely pre-decided of course feels a lot better.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461468/#Comment_461468" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-26T18:46:30+00:00" title="March 26, 2017  6:46PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2017 6:48PM by 2097.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Good call from Dave, and I agree with Sandra that some kind of more transparent rule may be helpful.

Yeah, this is why I used to be OK w/ 15 (or 15+4dF for things that are going to be spotted by passives), because if it's good enough for AW it's good enough for me.<br/>I also just remembered that the other DC I often used on the fly was 12/20. You get one consequence for 12, and another, better, if you can get 20. (Numbers chosen to resemble the probabilities for partials in low &amp; medium level AW.)<br/>It's actually pretty rare for players to do something for where there is a pre-written DC because they often try such weird and unexpected things. And so if I could come up with a binary pass-fail I would use 15, if I could come up with an AW-like situation I would use 12 for partial, 20 for complete.<br/><br/>Again, my home group is on hiatus since we wrapped up CoS and I only played in, and ran, con games since.

Anything without a DC explicitly set by the rules as 15. Period.</blockquote>\nThe reason I added 4dF to the DCs when prepping (which was only a pretty small subset of DCs, but things like trip wires etc) was because sticking with 15 always made it extremely optimal to have exactly 15 as passive perception. I wanted a chance for 13 or 14 to do some use, or for 16 or 17 to ocassionally be needed.<br/><br/>BTW, I didn't require both checking <i>and</i> a high PP. The PP was a fallback in case they didn't check. If they were like "we throw out flour to see if there's any trip wires" they could have PP negative 30 for all that mattered, they would find the trip wires because of the flour.<br/><br/>But for things like "I climb the tree" etc I would stick to the 15 (until I came up with the 12/20-rule which muddled things up).<br/>However, I'm really into just going "Sure, you can do it, no roll needed". (If they want to fail in order to gain insp they can just decide on their own to fail.) For things like climbing, for example. If it's in a fight, I'd let them roll every turn \u2014 a fail means they don't get up that particular turn, and will take further damage. Outside a fight I'd just have them narrate how they make it.\n<blockquote>And absolutely no re-rolls, best you could do was retroactively get advantage by trying again or getting help.</blockquote>\nFor me, that depended on why I asked them to roll in the first place. For easy-things-but-if-it's-in-a-fight-you-have-to-roll (pretty much only climbing), I'd ask them to roll every turn. For "either you can do it, or you can't do it" like lifting gates or picking locks or smashing through a door, you get one roll and then I let that roll ride forever.<br/><br/>And, insp you have to decide to spend before you roll, no retcons.<br/><br/>Hmm, what about if their strength increased? Should we allow a reroll then, say they return to That Unsmashable Door now that they've put on some muscle?

Some like to take on a persona, or perhaps identify closely with a character, like by keeping a diary "in-character".<br/><br/>In theory, that kind of person sounds like a really cool player to have at your game, right? They're intense, they're committed, and they likely have a really fleshed-out character to present. They're also heavily emotionally engaged with the game, which is a big thing for me when I think of the players I enjoy roleplaying with.<br/><br/>However, this conversation here made me look back at the various people I've played with who very strongly approach gaming that way.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of those people... were not people I enjoyed playing with all that much. None were disasters or problem players, but those definitely weren't my favourite groups or my favourite play experiences.<br/><br/>It's fairly likely that a player like that - who takes so much joy in character identification - is not going to enjoy GMing all that much.<br/><br/>Matt, does any of that sound familiar to you, or make sense to you?<br/><br/>I don't know if it means anything - it could be just coincidence, after all!

Add a reasonable amount of the other two qualities, and you've got yourself a good all-around roleplayer.<br/><br/>Reflecting on Paul's post, my personal experience is that highly motivated character actor roleplayers often have a critical lack of FLEXIBILITY: they often have a preordained idea of what roleplaying is, they have difficulty engaging with game mechanics, and consequently they may get sidelined by the processes of a game that is not very similar to their ideal game (a slow-moving, atmospheric freeform with strongly GM-managed plot). This would presumably be caused by the fact that they've already got their shangrila in sight: they know what they want, so the only question is whether this particular gaming group is on the same wavelength or not.

I've played every type of game under the sun, and so I understand the tradeoffs involved in, say, adopting different types of stances. As I think I may have alluded to upthread, what I sometimes see from player-only types is a lack of understanding that, yes, Virginia, you really do have to make trade-offs between different types of priorities.<br/><br/>A great specific example is I've seen players who don't want to put effort into writing good Flags / feel that Flags are a form of "self-railroading."

I remember a particular attempt at an Apocalypse World game (which turned out working, in the end, despite the challenges).<br/><br/>I had a player who played the Hardholder. When it came to describing the hardhold, he was full of ideas, drew a map, and came up with all kinds of interesting setting information which fed into play.<br/><br/>However, then we ended up with a handful of NPCs (as relationships to other PCs, for instance). I asked him, "Ok, before we start: you're in charge here. What is your relationship like with Toyota? What about Dremmer? Do you get along, are they troublemakers in the community? Do you trust them, or do you think they could be dangerous?"<br/><br/>Somehow, that really got his back up. He said, "I'm not going to tell you how I feel about your NPCs! What is this? No."<br/><br/>We had some further conversation, but he never caved on this point. I still don't know if he felt it was just "too much work" (not likely; the guy GMs a lot, makes illustrations of things for the game, etc) or he felt that it was tipping his hand ("I don't want you to know how I feel about those NPCs!"). It was pretty odd, in any case, and I never managed to get to the bottom of it, but somehow that question really made him get very defensive.<br/><br/>(Relevantly to this particular discussion, he GMs more than he plays, probably 2/3 or 3/4 of the time.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21004/a-new-policy-i-will-only-gm-for-gms/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21004/a-new-policy-i-will-only-gm-for-gms">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21004/a-new-policy-i-will-only-gm-for-gms/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21004/a-new-policy-i-will-only-gm-for-gms/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21004%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21004%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
