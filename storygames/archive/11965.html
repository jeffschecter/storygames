Zombie movies are about retaining your humanity, right? And every time you make choices that make you more like the zombies, you become a little less human--but how can you survive to fight the zombies without eventually having to make those choices?<br/><br/> Naturally, once I noticed the close parallels, I just had to write it up and see how it worked out. :-) <br/><br/> Anyone have any input on this?<br/><br/><b>Setting:</b><br/> There used to be a world out there. I almost think I remember it sometimes. Hospitals and iced lattes and laundry detergent and traffic lights. <br/><br/> Yeah, but then, maybe it was all just a dream. There's no world anymore, just pieces of it lying around in the filth and blood they left behind. The Undead. They come crawling out of The Graveyard looking for us, and everything they touch breaks a little more. Especially us.<br/><br/> There's a Remnant of humanity left in this broken husk of a world, and we all of us fight to hang on to it another day. Hang on to it when there's no food left, and I see us all starting to eye each other like the Undead do, like a meal to keep us going one more day. Hang on to it when one more friend let go, and you stare in his eyes as you blow his head off before he can kill the rest of you. Hang on to it when you'd rather just turn the gun on yourself than keep fighting one more day.<br/><br/><b>Key Phrases:</b><br/>Opening phrases:<br/>*The Undead are coming, and nothing will stop them until they kill us all.<br/>*But the fight's not over yet, and (Name) is still holding a (Favorite Weapon) for the first one to come for him/her.<br/>*The way it happened was\u2026<br/><br/>Closing phrase:<br/>*But it's not like anyone'll live to tell the story.<br/><br/>Conflict phrases:<br/>*But only if\u2026<br/>*And besides that\u2026 (And furthermore.)<br/>*Over my dead body. (It shall not come to pass.)<br/>*Back off. (You ask far too much.)<br/>*Okay, I give. (It was not meant to be.)<br/>*Deal. (And that was how it happened.)<br/>*Never happened. (But it was no matter.)<br/>*Oh, yeah? (We shall see what comes of it.)<br/><br/><b>Terms translation:</b><br/>These all function similarly to the way they are described in Polaris, but take on slightly different shades of meaning according to their new name and setting.<br/><br/>Heart=Survivor<br/>Mistaken=Undead<br/>New Moon=Angel<br/>Full Moon=Shotgun (i.e. 'riding shotgun')<br/>Cosmos=World<br/>Ice=Love<br/>Light=Will<br/>Zeal=Fight<br/>Weariness=Emptiness<br/>Veteran=Dead Inside<br/>Experience=Death (i.e. 'he died a little every day')<br/>Conflict=Fight<br/>Themes=Must-Haves<br/>Aspects=Items<br/>Offices=Reputation (aka how do the other survivors see you?)<br/>Fate=Can't Avoid Forever <br/>Blessings=Gear<br/>Abilities=Myself (roughly divided into 'I know', 'I can' and 'I am' categories)<br/><br/><b>During Character Creation:</b><br/>Under Reputation write 'Survivor'. Under Gear, choose  your Survivor's favorite weapon and write that down. Under Abilities, write 'I know the Undead'. <br/><br/><b>Death:</b><br/>The Survivor gains a point of Death every time he lose a conflict roll, or shows any signs of sympathy for one of the Undead or the Undead as a whole, hatred of a person or the people as a whole, cruelty, not caring any more, or giving up.<br/><br/>When a Survivor becomes Dead Inside he must have scene where he meets one of the Undead, likely one he once knew well, but it may be some other of the Undead who is important to the story, or just a random Undead One. <br/><br/>From this meeting he realizes that the Undead are in fact also trying to build a world again, in their own way, whatever way that is, and then he and the other Survivors are the ones breaking that world apart. <br/><br/>The Survivor gains the Item "Almost one of Them" under "Can't Avoid Forever".<br/><br/>As in the original, if Emptiness goes above 4, the Survivor gives up his fight and becomes Undead. The only way to avoid this is to negotiate his death during conflict before it reaches this point, by using the phrase, "But only if (Survivor's Name) dies".<br/><br/><br/>Anything not specifically mentioned is assumed to be played by the original rules.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Raquel" title="Raquel"><img alt="Raquel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Raquel">Raquel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267509/#Comment_267509" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T13:06:30+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  1:06PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Example Reputation Items:</b><br/><br/><i>Survivor</i><br/><br/>Description: You're not dead yet.<br/><br/>How it might help you: You made it this far, so you're not the type to just keel over and die.<br/><br/>How it might hinder you: What did you have to give up to be tough enough to make it this far?<br/><br/>Special Rules: Everyone starts with this item.<br/><br/><br/><i>Mother Superior</i><br/><br/>Description: You used to run a convent\u2014nice, calm place. Now you're trying to hold together a bunch of refugee survivors who need someone to look after them, and you're it.<br/><br/>How it might help you: They say the Undead won't touch holy ground. The others look up to because of your faith and authority. <br/><br/>How it might hinder you: They might be wrong about that holy ground thing. The others think you're weak and easy to take down so they can take charge.<br/><br/><br/><i>Scientist</i><br/><br/>Description:  You understand things, you know how to study them out when the rest of us are just trying to get through the next day.<br/><br/>How it might help you: You convince the others you found a cure for whatever it is causes the Undead to rise. You're the only thinker around, which makes you too valuable to be sent on the dangerous jobs. You are the only one who can figure out the notes left behind in The Graveyard .<br/><br/>How it might hinder you: You are blamed for causing the Undead Ones to start rising when they find out you worked in the place they now call The Graveyard. You're not so good at fighting, just thinking. The others don't think you're much use.<br/><br/><br/><i>Wanderer</i><br/><br/>Description: Where others feel safety in numbers, you travel light and alone. No need to tie yourself down when you can take what you need and move on.<br/><br/>How it might help you: You're used to working alone, and can handle yourself in tough places. You don't much care what happens to anyone else,  so there's no one that can be used against you. You know the ground around here, or anywhere, like nobody else does.<br/><br/>How it might hinder you: There's no one to come after you when you get yourself into trouble. When you do run into other people they don't trust you because you're an outsider. You're lonely.<br/><br/>Special Rules: If the character ever settles down in one place, this item vanishes.<br/><br/><br/><i>Fighter</i><br/><br/>Description: You never met an Undead One you couldn't take apart, and enjoy every minute of it. You're tough as nails, and everyone knows it.<br/><br/>How it might help you: The Undead know you, and they're scared. No one dares mess with you. People will do whatever you want, just as long as you stay around to kill things for them.<br/><br/>How it might hinder you: The Undead know you, and they're coming after you. Some young punk wants to take you down, just to say he did it. You know that moment will come when you freeze during a fight, and you won't make it out alive.<br/><br/><br/><i>The Girl</i><br/><br/>Description: You may not be the only girl around, but everyone thinks of you as The Girl. You made it this far, on your own, or maybe with some help, but you've never been one of the guys.<br/><br/>How it might help you: Men tend to take care of you and don't want you to get hurt. No one expects you to be as tough as you are, so you can catch them off guard easier. You're smaller and fit into hiding places where the Undead can't reach you.<br/><br/>How it might hinder you: Men don't like that you're tougher and smarter than them. Like it or not, you're not as strong as the guys, and that makes you easy to pick off. Things get kind of messy between people when you're the only girl around.<br/><br/><br/><b>Example Can't Avoid Forever Items:</b><br/><br/><i>Almost One of Them</i>: You've seen most of your friends\u2014and some enemies\u2014become one of Them. You can only fight it for so long, and sometimes you start to think: why even fight it?<br/><br/>How it might help or hinder you: You know how they think, you can use it against them. You're starting to think like them, and others see it. You're fighting someone you used to know.<br/><br/>Special Rules: You gain this Item when you become Dead Inside.<br/><br/><br/><i>The Shooting Star:</i> Everyone saw it burning across the sky, but no one knows what it is, if it's good or bad or nothing at all. Some people say it's death to the Undead Ones, some say it's death to us. No one knows<br/><br/>How it might help or hinder you: It gives your people hope. No one will come with you to look for it, because they're all too scared. You go on a wild goose chase after it instead of doing your job. You find it, but can't figure out  what you've found, and go mad trying.<br/><br/><br/><i>The Undead Bride:</i> You've all seen her in her ripped up wedding dress, sometimes walking under the stars, sometimes ripping open someone's skull. Somehow she's the picture of everything broken that used to be good.<br/><br/>How it might help or hinder you: She was your best friend, whom you always secretly hated. You don't know who she was, but you can't bring yourself to kill her. She still loves you.<br/><br/><br/><i>Your Father: </i> Is he still alive out there somewhere? Who knows.<br/><br/>How it might help or hinder you: Your hope of finding your father alive keeps you going no matter what. You find your father, but his mind is broken by horrible tortures from the Undead. You have to choose between saving your father and everything else you care about.<br/><br/><br/><i>A New City:</i> There's talk of bringing all the survivors into one new city, making it safe there. Some say it's been done already, someplace. Some say it's foolish talk that will get us all killed.<br/><br/>How it might help or hinder you: You will bring all your people together with the promise of building this city, and they will follow you anywhere. You followed someone to this city, only to discover that it was worse than The Graveyard. Someone has come from the city with a plea for help. <br/><br/><br/><b>Example Gear Items:</b><br/><br/><i>Shotgun:</i> The classic, if messy, weapon for killing Undead. As long as you can find ammo, and it doesn't misfire, you're all set.<br/><br/><i>Sword: </i>It's more of a close quarters weapon, but if you're good enough, it's even more effective than a gun. If you're good enough.<br/><br/><i>Truck:</i> It's big, it's rugged, and it hasn't broken down in weeks now. What would you do without it?<br/><br/><i>Dog:</i> Good old Brutus never leaves your side\u2014unless he's busy tearing apart the Undead.<br/><br/><br/><b>Example Myself Items:</b><br/><br/><i>I know the Undead:</i> You didn't survive this long without picking up some ideas about how to fight the Undead.<br/><br/>How it might help you: You know something about what you're doing anytime you go up against the Undead in any way.<br/><br/>How it might hinder you: You think you know more than you do. You're so sure of yourself you get careless.<br/><br/>Special Rules: Everyone starts with this item.<br/>\u2003<br/><br/><i>I know Weapons:</i> You know weapons like no one else you've met. Doesn't matter what kind, you get how they work and use them well, and you can make a weapon out of anything you find lying around<br/><br/>How it might help you: You find a broken weapon of a kind you've never seen before, and figure out how to fix it. Someone takes away your weapons, but you make new ones. <br/><br/>How it might hinder you: Everyone thinks you're a little freaky because of all you weird weapons, and they don't trust you. Your best weapon breaks at when it matters most.<br/><br/><br/><i>I know People:</i> You can read people at the drop of a hat, you got them all figured out, whether it's one person or a whole crowd. And knowing what they're going to do, you change their minds pretty easy too.<br/><br/>How it might help you: You're being attacked by a mob. You're trying to gather survivors into a group that will stick together. Your best friend betrays you.<br/><br/>How it might hinder you: They figure out you're playing them. You meet someone you can't figure out. You talk someone into doing things your way, and it gets them killed.<br/><br/><br/><i>I can hide:</i> No one sees you unless you want them too. You just naturally find all the good hiding places and blend in to the background real good.<br/><br/>How it might help you: You're planning a secret attack. You need to hide from the Undead. You stole something big and need to get away with it<br/><br/>How it might hinder you: Your hiding places all get found. Someone sees you.<br/><br/><br/><i>I can fix stuff:</i> You work with your hands. Machines, wood, whatever. If you can hold it, you can fix it.<br/><br/>How it might help you: Your truck breaks down, again. The Undead Ones are going to find that hole in the roof sooner or later. It's easy to scrounge broken stuff\u2014just about anything you want.<br/><br/>How it might hinder you: That mending won't hold quite long enough. You end up in the middle of nowhere with nothing to scrounge for parts.<br/> <br/><br/><i>I am big:</i> You're built like a brick wall and you don't need a weapon to take out the Undead, just twist their necks and the heads pop right off.<br/><br/>How it might help you: You can lift heavy stuff. You don't need a weapon besides your fists. It's hard for anyone to hit hard enough to hurt you.<br/><br/>How it might hinder you: You're slow. They can see you coming.<br/><br/><br/><i>I am old</i>: You've seen a lot of life, before and after the Undead. You know things you can only learn through a lot of living. But some days there are just a lot of years to carry around with you.<br/><br/>How it might help you: You have the wisdom of many years in your head. You know when to shut up and let things happen. You know when enough is enough.<br/><br/>How it might hinder  you: You're the only one left who remembers. You tire easily. Your granddaughter is all you care about in this world, and she's in danger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
