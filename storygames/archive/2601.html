People say Star Wars opened up new vistas of imagination and possibility, when in actuality, A New Hope is nothing more or less than the most successful clip show ever.  There isn't a single moment of real exploration of how the world might change or how things other than our traditional tropes might exist; Lucas cuts together the Sierra Madre and the Temple of Doom and the Triumph of the Will and he puts some pretty pictures on the screen to make you think he's doing something.  Star Wars isn't good science fiction; Star Wars isn't science fiction at all.  Science fiction is about how things could be different.  In many ways, Star Wars crippled the genre, in a way it took LeGuin and people like her to finally recover from.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59791/#Comment_59791" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T18:19:51+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  6:19PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2007 6:43PM by Bill_White.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David Brin argued in Salon years ago that the Star Trek universe was preferable to the Star Wars milieu because the rational egalitarianism of the former is a far more palatable view of things than the monarchical elitist mysticism of the latter.

Cause I might agree there.<br/><br/>I dunno about the originals. It was some pretty epic, fun, light action awesomeness. I remember how big I was into Star Wars even in the mid-nineties.  My friends heard that "Toys R Us has some sort of new line of Star Wars figures!", and we were anticipating possibly a line-up of figures that were going to be in the new movies (uh... no. This was 1996, a year or so before the movie was even begin to start filming). Instead it was this new revamp of the OLD figures, called "Power of the Force" or something.  We all, college students all, left Toys R Us with 1-2 of these figures anyway.<br/><br/>But the prequels. Man, they sucked. Graphically stunning, but even the stunning scenes really had no focus.<br/><br/>BUT, to bring this back to gaming a little?<br/><br/>Uh...<br/><br/>Hmmmm...<br/><br/>I still don't mind playing Star Wars themed RPGs, but usually there has to be some edge: 5 years after Return of the Jedi; 50 to 100 to 1000 years after Jedi; Knight of the Old Republic Era; etc.  I played a one-shot high action SW game set in the "prequel era" where we were all "ARK Troop Commandos", which are basically super-elite free-thinking clone troops. Even then, though we saw no Gungans, were not trumped by any background NPC, and were basically doing wacky kung-fu kickass commando shit set in a loose SW frame, parts of me still felt uneasy at times.  <br/><br/>But yeah, no problem playing in other eras, especially just using the trappings.  I ran a mini-campaign using the Star Wars rules back in college where the PCs were all Jedi or Jedi-related characters that lived on a planet far, far from the Republic. After uncovering some ancient Jedi ruins, they discovered that:<br/><br/>1) Their planet was Yavin, and<br/>2) It was haunted by Luke Skywalker's "Jedi Ghost Thingy", and<br/>3) Luke died 30,000 years ago.<br/>...and things pretty much worked and looked like they did in the Republic Era (technology, etc), just a long history of a battle of good and evil in the interrim, the Core Planets/Core of the Galaxy (in terms of society) switching places a couple times, etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59817/#Comment_59817" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T22:01:45+00:00" title="March  7, 2007 10:01PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990628/REVIEWS08/906280301/1023" rel="nofollow">Here</a>'s one such claim:\n<blockquote>\xe2\u20ac\u0153Star Wars'' effectively brought to an end the golden era of early-1970s personal filmmaking and focused the industry on big-budget special-effects blockbusters, blasting off a trend we are still living through.

I don't see <i>Star Wars</i> changing that particularly, except that it was quantitatively more successful than its predecessors.  The James Bond films were <i>huge</i> during the 1960's, and they're far shallower than <i>Star Wars</i> and nowhere near as well done from a technical standpoint.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first film also makes some thematic statements that are important, if shop-worn.  First, in order to become a functional human being, you have to step outside of your social role and think critically about the society you're living in--and if necessary, oppose it.  Second, technology dehumanizes us, and it has a symbiotic relationship with the military/industrial complex.  Third, in order to grow as a human being, you have to be willing to trust in something beyond materialistic thinking.  As a <i>bildungsroman</i> for young Americans growing up in the 1970's, these were important lessons for kids to learn and internalize--it's sort of like <i>Beowulf</i> for the children of Hippies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttacking these themes because they're trite sort of misses the point.  The lessons in almost <i>all</i> our classics are trite.  <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, the <i>Odyssey</i>, Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>--they're basically treacle once you boil away every trace of craftsmanship and originality away.  Just because a lesson is simple and shop-worn, doesn't mean it's not valuable if delivered at the right time, or if we're reminded of it when we forget it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs <i>Star Wars</i> a science-fiction film the way <i>2001</i> is a science-fiction film?  No.  But I don't think that's a valid distinction.  <i>Star Wars</i> is an adventure story with high-tech "color."  And that's fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller" title="Kat Miller"><img alt="Kat Miller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.enter.net/~whim/picks/ittykat.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller">Kat Miller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59853/#Comment_59853" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T06:15:31+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  6:15AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked the Original Series because there may have been only one female, but she shot things, raced on speeder bikes, led the guys in her own escape, Lea was fearless, she was a girl who did things.

It was so tight. If someone dug up unused designs for Star Wars spaceships, droids or aliens and showed them to you, I'd be willing to be that you could recognise them for what they were instantly. Now I don't know how well a TIE fighter would work, but it looks so original and cool that I don't care. I also appreciated that everything outside Imperial buildings or ships was dirty and broken down. So we have gee-whiz technology rendered down to barely operational junk, which gives the galaxy a sense of technological stagnation. This was pretty different. It was a very lived-in world and I think that made it all the more immersive. I doubt many people who play in Star Wars games care so much about the characters or plot of the movies, they just want to bask in the look and feel of the universe. It's a universe that still has potential, in my opinion. The first Knights of the Old Republic game had a more interesting story than the new movies, maybe even the originals too.<br/><br/>I don't think Star Wars did much to injure sci-fi in film. I'd say Alien's success did more damage. 90% of all sci-fi movies are sci-fi/horror movies these days. There really haven't been many epic space operas since Star Wars. What was the last one?

The movies are beautiful. Ralph McQuarrie is an amazing genius of a designer, not to mention the amazing work of John Dykstra, Phil Tippett, and all the incredible people who made the movies so beautiful.</p>\n<p>So, look, there's some stuff that's good, that is recontextualized for a space age audience: good vs. evil (always a favorite, though close examination is never flattering in these cases), supernaturally competent characters, and phallic symbols galore (which, honestly, there's nothing wrong with; it's only the <em>obsession</em> with them that's bad, and you can't fault a movie for being about masculinity, and a boy and his father, and they fight with swords that <em>come out of their groins</em>. (Dammit! I can't find that picture!) This isn't <em>even</em>Jung. This is <em>Freud</em>.)</p>\n<p>But, being as they were, according to Lucas, "Movies for kids", they lack subtlety, sure.</p>\n<p>When I've run Star Wars-based games, there have been basic rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Everyone is a Jedi. That's what the damned stories are about. There's no point in playing a game in Arthurian England and playing a farmer unless the farmer is <em>really</em> a knight.</li>\n<li>Everyone has parents and a family. Had I been able to do so at the time, I'd have made some sort of relationship map thing to make that work; as it was, I winged it.</li>\n<li>Questions are always about use and abuse of power. Mysteries are there to reveal, not withhold, stories of abuse of power. Every artifact, contact, whatever, is about the absolute power granted Jedi.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's some creepy stuff about Jedi. They're a theocracy, for one. Also, they abduct children and put them in their monasteries (which, really, that's supercreepy). They may kill based solely on their judgement and there is no check to balance them. This stuff is pretty good fodder. I mean, what if a Jedi wants to know who her parents are? That's good stuff. Totally impossible in the movies; too gnarly.

It isn't merely "good" and "evil."  The "good" side is suppose to be an unemotional machine, and the Jedi think that's a good thing!  That's part of why the Dark Side is as seductive as is it -- it's not just the power to throw around a little lightning at your foes, but the power to <i>accept your feelings</i>.  Sure, in many ways those Dark Side emotions are used as an excuse to do bad things, but that doesn't remove the fact that something that looks like a black-and-white morality has something a bit more grey at its core.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59905/#Comment_59905" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T09:54:30+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  9:54AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jasper Polane</cite>They were not.

That particular set of actors really carries the movies, even when they get schlocky. The prequels do not share this benefit, as highlighted by the laughter in the theater during the supposed romantic scenes.<br/><br/>[Cross-posted with Landon.]<br/><br/>But yeah, let's focus on questionable statements of race/gender/class. I think that's best way to go, rather than "Star Wars sucks/rules!"<br/><br/>I think it's pretty sad when in some other galaxy far, far away, which isn't connected with European peoples in any way, where you've got funny-looking alien species running all over the place, the near-total majority of the baseline humans are light-skinned. Even on the multi-sunned desert planet. Like, did Lucas actually get to the second movie and Lando Calrissian before he even noticed "Hey!

Luke gained faith in himself.  Han gained faith in something other than himself.<br/><br/>I also just realized the parallels between that conversation Han had with Luke &amp; the bit between Vader &amp; Admiral Motti: "Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerous ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes."  The parallel is weak, but it does show both sides of the conflict dealing with the twilight of their religion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59951/#Comment_59951" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T12:55:24+00:00" title="March  8, 2007 12:55PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite>Why are you people liking Star Wars in my "hate Star Wars" thread?

I actually started absorbing the franchise lore in 1995 or so, after playing the old D6 RPG with my friends for the first time and enjoying it enough to become a regular GM. And pretty much, I only got into that stuff deeply because it seemed like part of being a good GM for the game. So, when I personally think about what Star Wars <i>is</i>, I think about the kickass campaigns I've been in and/or run, the rollicking, carefree environment for gaming, first. I think of the movies and novels as a distant second, more inspirational elements (both for stuff I like and don't like) than anything else.<br/><br/>But I'll give you one: I've always thought that the Star Wars campaigns I ran and played in were better than Star Wars.

That is why when I played in a prequel-era Star Wars game I made a policy wonk Senator from a traditionalist but insignificant planet who was constantly working diligently to improve the Galaxy for all its inhabitants. Because I wanted someone who would show that the Republic was worth saving and why it was so tragic that their laser-sword wielding priesthood couldn't balance their checkbooks, let alone save it. Did anyone in the Jedi ever believe in The People?  No? Well, why would they ever care if the people get trod on then?

Being 14, I already could pick holes in the science (how do you stop a laser beam? you can't fly a spaceship like a WWII fighter), but I thought it was marvellous, and the next fancy-dress party I went as Obi-Wan.<br/><br/>By the time RotJ rocked around I was pushing 19 and highly cynical. RotJ lost me. I thought the plot was wrapped up far too neatly and happily, I thought Luke had not had to work for his mastery. The new aliens were too cute and Muppety for words. Mentally, I scratched Star Wars from my canon in 1983.<br/><br/>The original <i>Star Wars</i> (AKA <i>A New Hope</i>) is a confused tale from a director mashing dozens of sources together and waving his hand mightily. It's a fairy tale so it must have princesses, and Good and Evil. It must have mystical prophecies, great destiny from humble beginnings. That sort of squashes up against the Roman-Nazi Imperials and their foil the American Adventurer, not to mention Obi-Wan's Kurosawa Samurai act. As a result, morals are very fluid, and more or less suit the momentary pastiche rather than a consistent character (the characters are all pretty much cardboard cut-outs). Hence Obi-Wan must rattle on about how the Force is about peace and harmony in his Mystical Old-Timer scene, but he chops off a bloke's arm in a bar without blinking when it's time for his Kick-Arse Samurai scene. There's no problem with blowing up millions of poor schlubs on the Death Star because hey, they work for the Empire and they are EVIL! (besides, you've got have the Dambusters scene). Life is cheap in Lucas's view of the post-Vietnam US, but only when they're not Us. Trust your feelings Luke, because THOUGHT IS BAD, thought got us into this mess and only by believing in the Good, the Light, the White will we get out off it again. That and a good air force.<br/><br/>ANH could get away with it because it wasn't taking itself so weightily. In the end it was about Lucas's neat toys, and it handwaved all the problems and inconsistencies. We could have said "George, why are you peddling the myth of Divine Right alongside the American Dream and hoping we'll take it seriously?" and he could have said "Duh! It's about the spaceships."<br/><br/>But no, it had to become a phenomenon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60624/#Comment_60624" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T11:46:05+00:00" title="March 12, 2007 11:46AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, there's something profound in the original<i> Star Wars </i>movies -- which Lucas appears to have done completely without realizing it, or to have completely forgotten by the time he made the "prequels" ([rant]which my daughter, now three, will never, ever be shown. She will know of three <i>Stars Wars</i> films and one <i>Matrix</i>, period.[/rant) Move by movie, looking at the crunch moments in story-games terms, specifically as escalating "even now? even now?" choices in the Vincent Baker mode -- I'm thinking especially of Vincent's "A or B?" essay (<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/creatingtheme.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lumpley.com/creatingtheme.html</a>):<br/><br/><i>Star Wars</i><br/>Luke: Follow the crazy old man off on a damn fool crusade or stay home to help with the harvest? Stay home... whoops! Flee smoking ruins of home. Nevermind.<br/>Han and Luke: Go save the Princess from the heart of the enemy fortress or stay hidden in relative safety? Save the princess!<br/>Han: Go back and help your new friend or take the money and run? Go help your friend!<br/>Luke: Trust the crazy old man's freakin' VOICE IN YOUR HEAD or keep the targeting computer on? Turn that computer off and listen to the voices!<br/><br/><i>The Empire Strikes Back</i><br/>Luke: Go try to save your friends when your wizened master tells you it will doom them and everything they sacrified for, or stay with your wizened master and learn more cool powerz to win later? Go save your friends!<br/><br/><i>Return of the Jedi</i><br/>Luke: Try to save your father from himself or run away, or if you can't run away chop his head off? Try to save him!<br/><br/>In each film, Luke -- and to a less dramatic degree, the other characters -- is confronted by a choice between doing the loving, trusting, human thing towards specific individuals and doing the logical, strategically sound thing that subordinates individuals to the Greater Good. Every time (after that initial kick with the slaughter of his family...), he goes with head over heart, despite all the warnings. And yet the big picture, grand strategic Greater Good always turns out right in the end, anyway. (In Vincent Baker's terms, this is responding to, "'A or B? Choose one!" with "choosing A over B ultimately gets you both A and B.") In each case, it works because the individuals Luke chooses over the abstract Greater Good always turn out to be, often against all expectations, the ones who save him in return: Obi-Wan actually does know how to blow up the Death Star in the first film (and it's only because we've seen that scene dozens of times that the choice to listen to him seems sensible and obvious); Luke's captured friends end up rescuing him in the second film; Luke's father breaks the mold of a lifetime and saves him at the last moment in the third film.<br/><br/>There's a clear moral message, of which "trust your feelings" is a marginally passable distillation: "Do right by the people you know and care about ('love thy neighbhor...'), and they'll do right by you, and the big picture will get taken care of in the process, somehow."<br/><br/>This totally fails to happen in the prequels, notably. There's no clear moral dilemma for Anakin in any of the films, let alone across all of them. He tends to stumble into critical moments and react with spasmic inconsistency (turning on the fighter's autopilot, charging Dooku too fast, happening on Mace Windu about to kill Palpatine). If he consistently choose to sacrifice the welfare of individuals for the Greater Good, only to discover that the very ruthlessness of the sacrifice undermined the Greater Good fatally -- the means polluting the ends -- then the prequels would have been a perfectly balanced thematic counterpoint to the original films. If he'd chosen consistently to sacrifice the Greater Good for specific individuals (e.g. the whole "Save Padme" plotline) and found that the Greater Good didn't take care of itself as a result, it would be an interestingly dark and world-wise counter-argument to the optimism of the original films. As it was, it was neither, and thus mush.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60626/#Comment_60626" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T11:53:26+00:00" title="March 12, 2007 11:53AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S: From what little I know of George Lucas's biography, the theme of the original films tracks very closely to a young Lucas being told by his difficult and demanding father, "You can't do this crazy kid stuff you love and still earn a decent living or adult respect, so choose!" and Lucas saying "Okay, I'm going to make a career out of tinkering with cameras and '30s pulp serials!" -- ending up with Lucas getting both the crazy kid stuff and the respect &amp; money, and I suspect some kind of long-sought-for final approval from his father.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60642/#Comment_60642" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T13:00:09+00:00" title="March 12, 2007  1:00PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great insight, Sydney, and yes, that certainly is an ideal of the movies.

But "do the right thing by specific individuals instead of sacrificing them to the big picture, which will probably take care of itself if individuals do right by each other" is a much more practical and livable ethic than "individual people can and must be sacrificed for the Greater Good," if only because we human beings are much, much better at figuring out what other individual human beings need and how to help them get it than at understanding what society as a whole needs.

Lenin or Yoda, for that matter. Yoda isn't advising Luke to go out actively and eliminate entire categories of people to serve the long-term interests of humanity ("kill the Stormtroopers" isn't ethically objectionable in the same way as, say, "all peasants who have more than one cow, plus their families right down to the children"). But Yoda is arguing in the second film that Luke should let his friends die for the Greater Good -- when it turns out, a movie later, that those friends were actually damned important for the Greater Good to happen at all (note that Luke doesn't have a blessed thing to do with destroying the Death Star: Han, Luke, and Lando do it).<br/><br/>What's worse, both Yoda and Obi-Wan -- "what I told you was true, from a certain point of view" -- clearly believe they have the right to lie to Luke about absolutely critical things in his past in order to get Luke to do what they consider to be the Right Thing. Yes, it'd probably been premature to tell Luke in the first movie, "Hi! This was your father's lightsaber. By the way, he's now the Emperor's right-hand man. Oh, and I pushed him into a lava pool." But I don't think they were <i>ever</i> going to tell him, at least not until they had him thoroughly "trained" ("indoctrinated"?): Luke found out himself, the hard way, and then confronted them. That was another, insidious example of sacrificing someone -- in this case, Luke's right to know -- to the Greater Good, and having it backfire badly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60796/#Comment_60796" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-13T08:48:45+00:00" title="March 13, 2007  8:48AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sydney Freedberg</cite>Oh, and I pushed him into a lava pool.</blockquote>\nWhile lopping off all of his arms and legs in one awkward circular swing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60806/#Comment_60806" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-13T09:48:58+00:00" title="March 13, 2007  9:48AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, not too good to mention that either.

ago, but they were leery of the constraints involved in playing a story where you <i>know </i>the ending, or at least some critical aspects of it. (Tony Lower-Basch: "I want the freedom to blow up the Force.")<br/><br/>But if you treat the prequels and all the Expanded Universe dreck as non-canonical -- that is, if you treat them as a source of interesting material to mine, rather than as constraints -- then it's staggering to fall back on how <i>little</i> the original trilogy told you about the Fall of the Republic, the Jedi Order, or even the backstories of the protagonists. Maybe all good Jedi had to be married, including Obi-Wan and Yoda. Maybe Palpatine wasn't a Senator, or perhaps he started out as a good guy and fell into corruption. Maybe the Clone Wars were a slave revolt. Maybe the Stormtroopers started out as a volunteer militia defending the Republic and only later got political, somewhat like the original <i>Freikorps </i>and <i>Sturmabteilung </i>of post-World War I Germany. Maybe Luke and Leia's mother was a Sith.<br/><br/>In fact, what little we know from the original films is sometimes <i>contradicted </i>by the appalling prequels. In <i>The Return of the Jedi</i> (viz. <a href="http://www.blueharvest.net/scoops/rotj-script.shtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.blueharvest.net/scoops/rotj-script.shtml</a>):<br/><br/>BEN<br/>...You see, what happened to your father was my fault....When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.<br/><br/>You <i>can</i> reconcile that with Cute Anakin the Pod-Racer Pilot being taken on as a student by Qui-J.. -- uh -- by Liam Neason, with a young Obi-Wan resisting and saying, "No! Don't do it!" every step of the way, but it takes extraordinary mental gymnastics. I think the story implicit in Lucas's original film was much more interesting: a young hotshot star pilot shows extraordinary potential, an overly proud Jedi Master takes him under his wing and starts teaching him to use the Force outside of whatever the official Jedi training regime might be, and the young pilot picks up his master's pride and redoubles it and redoubles it until both their lives and the society they sought to defend are in ruins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60871/#Comment_60871" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-13T12:48:41+00:00" title="March 13, 2007 12:48PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoops!

No, it's very scary bad with scary badness -- but, oh yeah, don't take your sword, 'cause you don't need it... Hahahaha! You took your sword! You failed the test, you failed the test!" If he weren't a cute little Muppet I'd kick his ass. Obi-Wan is superior and manipulative, but at least he feels <i>bad</i> about it.

In that story, the imbalance between the light and dark sides of the Force, as evidenced in the conflict between the Jedi and the Sith, can only be healed through self-sacrifice. Both the Jedi and the Sith believe in sacrificing <em>others</em> (for "the greater good" or for their selfish gain,) and Anakin at first does great evil because he gives in to one side or the other... only by refusing to sacrifice Padme or his children for the greater good and by sacrificing himself to protect them can he restore the balance and defeat Palpatine and Yoda, the architects of the great evil.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109612/#Comment_109612" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T00:35:31+00:00" title="November 26, 2007 12:35AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those of you who don't know what talysman is talking about, these rambling articles are incredible fun to read:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.davidbrin.com/starwarsarticle1.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.davidbrin.com/starwarsarticle1.html</a><br/><br/>And the original article that mentions all the "clues" along the way, and makes fun of a whole bunch of inconsistencies.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/1999/06/15/brin_side/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/1999/06/15/brin_side/index.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2601/killing-your-father-star-wars" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2601/killing-your-father-star-wars" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2601/killing-your-father-star-wars/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2601%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F2601%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
