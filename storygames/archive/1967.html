                    When I was in sixth grade, the school placed half a dozen tree trunk stumps on the school yard.  They were wide enough to stand on, to various degrees, and about two feet high.  I assume they were meant to be used as stools.<br/><br/>In no time, my friends and I were hopping from one to the other, and soon we developed a game: weâ€™d count to three and all jump to the next one, last man standing sort of wins.  Soon people figured out that you could lean back and therefore lift the stump onto its edge, then move back and forth, sideways, to basically walk the stump around.  Other people kicked back when they jumped to make it harder for the next person to land, or even to kick the stump over.  People didnâ€™t always count, or didnâ€™t always jump, but we had really no rule in place to disqualify anyone.<br/><br/>Over the next few weeks, we had a ton of fun playing that way.  We played every day, in almost every recess.  However, the game sooner or later always went awry when someone moved their stump to the other edge of the yard, or kicked too many over, or did something else that frustrated the other players too much to continue playing.  It turns out that we were playing by different rules, and in fact, we were playing different games:  some of the kids aimed to be the last one standing.  Others wanted to show how far they could jump.  Yet others just tried to screw with whoever was around.  And finally, there were players who didnâ€™t know what was going on, but enjoyed the yelling and shouting and people falling over; passive participants and voyeurs, if you want.<br/><br/>After one of our fights over the game, when we accused each other of cheating or not playing right, a teacher ordered us to sit down, agree on a set of rules, hammer out what exactly the game was, and then all play by those rules.<br/><br/>We never played again.                </div>

                            First thought that comes into my mind: <em>hello, liability issue!</em><br/><br/>More seriously, I might forward the suggestion that the stumps were <em>toys</em> with which you played <em>games</em> -- and each of you were playing a different game.                        </div>

                            That's probably accurate.  We had fun playing different games together, and didn't want to be tied down to just one specific set of what we would be able to do.<br/><br/>(And it was in Germany, so civil liability wasn't really much of an issue.)                        </div>

                            Parallel play. As long as my idea of what the game is and what the rules are doesn't actively interfere with yours, we can play together. Once they start to interfere, a single vision needs to emerge, players need to retreat into parallel paths again, or play becomes not-fun and stops. My (offensive to same, apparently) feeling is that a large amount of roleplaying (indeed, a large amount of social interaction in general) is fundamentally parallel, toy-play, without a significant collaborative element or functional conflict resolution method. People don't cooperate well at <i>anything</i> without some kind of rules. Kids are better at it because they haven't formed firm identities yet.                        </div>

                            Fascinating that Christian shared a really cool little vignette with us, and the first thing we do is analyze it in terms of the game being played.  I really dug the story on it's own merits; quite possibly because it resonates with my own life.  My college roommate and I used to burn off stress by taking a pair of <i>bo ken</i> onto the quad and participating in an activity called "thunking."  Which eventually resulted in rushing him down the hill to the ER for stitches for his forehead, with him laughing about some fencing term all the way.<br/><br/>What was interesting is that without really wanting to formalize a game out of it, we did spontaneously come up with rules and knew when one of us had won or lost.                        </div>

Monkey brains. They do that. Play is how you learn to be a social animal.                        </div>

                            Mark,<br/><br/>Parallel play--that's an awesome way of looking at it.  You're spot on, of course.  And yes, the idea of sharing this tidbit was to allow comparisons to roleplaying groups, because this kind of play is, as you say, very common.  I don't think that's a bad thing to say; I think that even more traditional, gamecraft-oriented people acknowledge these different styles and generally put the burden on the GM to allow each parallel strand to be explored as much as possible.                        </div>

                            Have you played the card game which I can only refer to as The Chairman's Game?<br/><br/>It's sort of like Crazy 8's, but not really.<br/><br/>The game relies upon the fact that you aren't allowed to talk about the rules. (JB, Daniel, feel free to penalize me for that one).<br/><br/>Any question you ask the person running the game will likely illicit a response of "that's a very good question, thank you for asking."<br/><br/>The game is fun (but sometimes infuriating) because everyone is playing a totally different game, even though they are playing with the same deck of cards and hearing the same things being said. Talking, especially rules-talking, doesn't happen. You have to guess at the patterns, and you have to assume that you understand how the rules work and interact.<br/><br/>...Should rules be stated up front, the game would suck hardcore.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that's what you were trying to get at, but the stump story made me think of it.<br/>I've played it twice with my gaming group, and it le r0xx0rz.                        </div>

                            Joe, there are a variety of versions of that game, usually known under the name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_(game)" rel="nofollow">Mao</a>.<br/><br/>In middle and high school we played the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_and_max" rel="nofollow">Sam &amp; Max</a>-invented game, Fizzball.  It involves an aluminum baseball bat and cases of cheap soda, though according to Sam you're supposed to use "that cheap evil-smelling beer they sell around drinking holidays."<br/><br/>We also played Nutface, but I don't think you folks wanna hear about that.                        </div>

                            A game of Nutface started like this:<br/><br/>One (male) person would walk up to you and cradle your face in their hands.  And then, just when you thought they were being amazingly tender and sweet (or just fucking weird), they would give you a wicked smirk and yell "Nutface!"<br/><br/>The implication was that they had just scratched themselves (under their clothing) and, consequently, had just rubbed fresh ball sweat all over your face.  Whether they actually did this or not was never really clear and was, in fact, kinda immaterial to the whole game.  It was more the idea of how disgusting that would be.  That's what drove play.<br/><br/>Because, of course, the only proper revenge for being nutfaced was nutfacing the other guy.  Of course, you had to do this while defending yourself from the plethora of nutfacings that were inevitably now happening all around you.<br/><br/>I think the game was originally invented during an all-male slumber party when one of us (and I suspect I can guess whom) had no real intentions of going to sleep or letting anyone else sleep either.  Of course, after Nutface occurred a few times during school lunch periods, some of the girls were pissed off that they could be nutfaced but had no real way of nutfacing anyone back.  And so the pussyface was invented.<br/><br/>And that's all I'm going to say about that.                        </div>

                            Thor, you appear to have crossposted with Walton. What's strange is that it apparently took you at least six minutes to type the phrase "NUT face" a dozen times.                        </div>

                            Nutface. Yeah, we had a similar game when I was a kid, where you'd come out of the lavatory with your hands a little wet, shake someone's hand, and impishly comment "Don't you hate it when you pee on your hands?"<br/><br/>I tried to pull this shit on my uncle once. Being a seasoned pro at such hijinks, he swiftly trumped the gross-out by putting a little dollop of peanut butter on his fingers, changing the comment to "Don't you hate that cheap toilet paper?"<br/><br/>Sorry. Nutface may be detracting from the cool thread Christian and Mark have gotten started.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite>Sorry. Nutface may be detracting from the cool thread Christian and Mark have gotten started.</blockquote>But that's what makes this Storygames. To drag that back on topic, though - imagine a person with different hygeinic taboos or personal space customs than your peer group trying to assimilate into Nutface. Heck, just sticking to the example in play - interesting how things shift going from a homosocial to heterosocial context, eh?                        </div>

It is with not inconsiderable embarrassment that it took me a few seconds to break down the word etymology and realize you weren't actually talking about gay people at all. I blame Graham, for generally gaying thing up around here.<br/><br/>So, um, yes, a good example of such a shift in social dynamics.                        </div>
