How did it play out?</blockquote>\nWe used a modified version of the game rules and I didnt force the Characters to be at odds of course. <br/><br/>What we discussed before hand is that Knights may have many things in common, but that doesn't make them the same, or give them the same goals... or even make them "good". <br/><br/>Of the three Characters one hoped to find and win his true love, the heart's desire of another was to become a true knight of the Round Table and the third cared only for glory.<br/><br/>The setting of the Tourney, specifically the joust gave them a goal that put them all at odds on some level.<br/><br/>Roberts wanted to win the Joust so that he could woo the lovely girl, Wembley saw not the victory but the Glory that went with it (winning the girl and becoming the son-in-law to the Earl were just elements that meant MORE glory), Gondoddin wished to win as the first step to gaining the attention and respect of the King. None were "evil", all followed the rules of honor but by having the same objective they were naturally not allies. <br/><br/>The Players were free to be take on the roles of the Earl or the Mother but all were eager to play knights. But no, they really never had to work in concert.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vae_editor" title="vae_editor"><img alt="vae_editor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vae_editor">vae_editor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155120/#Comment_155120" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T13:25:53+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  1:25PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Cool.
