It sounds like a hoot, like it's meant to be a funny, over-the-top Mad Max style game where everyone shares equal responsibility for making it a crazy and intense experience.<br/><br/>I'm not affiliated with the game or the publishers in any way, I just want to see them make their Kickstarter goal so the game actually comes out. With three days to go, they're a little under $500 short of the mark, so I wanted to bring this one to people's attention. The quickstart rules are up on the Kickstarter page if you want to know how this one runs. I'm really eager to play it!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463563/#Comment_463563" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-26T21:24:47+00:00" title="May 26, 2017  9:24PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2017 10:07PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I very much agree. Rafa and I also mentioned it in another thread <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21137/may17-new-games-thread#latest" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21137/may17-new-games-thread#latest</a><br/><br/>I will post the response here too because I think it clarifies some stuff and this thread is specifically for the game. Here's the post: <br/><br/>I backed Trouble For Hire a while ago. It looks super impressive and unique. I definitely wouldn't describe it as Mad Max, it's premise is a much, much more interesting\u2014gameplay wise\u2014and original concept for a game; I don't even think Mad Max is even close to describing the game. I also wouldn't necessarily say that it is one player and five GM's, the roles are much more interesting than that. I think the more time you take to read about the game on it's Kickstarter page, the more you'll appreciate it. Take a look at the link below to get a better idea of what it's about. I think people should check it out. It is one of those games that definitely deserves backing. It only has 3 days left on its Kickstarter, so if it sounds interesting to you, take a look at it sooner rather than later <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>I also think that Tall Pines looks excellent. It has been playtested extremely thoroughly for about 3 or 4 years, without any rule changes within the last year, so it should run exceptionally well. If you have a chance give both of these games a look, do so. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>Here are the links: <br/><br/>Trouble For Hire:<br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ndpaoletta/trouble-for-hire-a-game-of-hi-octane-road-adventur/posts/1895974?ref=backer_project_update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ndpaoletta/trouble-for-hire-a-game-of-hi-octane-road-adventur/posts/1895974?ref=backer_project_update</a><br/><br/>Tall Pines:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1503244936/tall-pines-a-surreal-murder-mystery-roleplaying-ga" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1503244936/tall-pines-a-surreal-murder-mystery-roleplaying-ga</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463567/#Comment_463567" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-27T05:29:50+00:00" title="May 27, 2017  5:29AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2017 5:30AM by BeePeeGee.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for pointing out <i>Trouble for Hire</i>, it was not on my radar yet.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">@Jeff_B_Slater</a>, I've been thinking about <i>Tall Pines</i>, too.
