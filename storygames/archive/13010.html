I suspect we'll include these versions with our current PDF downloads. I've got an iPad to test with, and I'll ask some of our download customers to take a look.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe've got to the stage of rejigging the InDesign files in CS5 so they export into reasonable ePub format; next is to make the output look acceptable on various platforms. The ePub html we export is very plain, so that the CSS can do the work. I know that many directives are ignored, and that font sizes vary wildly. i don't know how tables are handled.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I'm looking for a decent CSS file for ePub settings which works across multiple platforms; failing that, differing CSSs for different devices. I'll get back to the forum with the results of the testing.

Scrolling is right-out, for obvious reasons (all the scanability triggers--layout, image positions, text block positions--are gone; the number of screens compared to number of pages is HUGE).<br/><br/>So the best bet is chapter selection, because you can name the chapters whatever you want in the toc.ncx. As a result, EACH concept could have its own chapter, as would each discrete procedure or type of reference. At a bare minimum, chunk your source into chapters for every section and sub-section, and name and enumerate them meaningfully (but concisely) in the toc.<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293370/#Comment_293370" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-14T15:31:31+00:00" title="September 14, 2010  3:31PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Maybe I'm off base, but don't most EPUB readers handle CSS for themselves?

Which could also mean that you have to re-chunk (into individual HTML files) each section, to be able to have a TOC entry call a specific section (i.e. not a whole chapter). But editing the toc.ncx file is pretty simple--it's just markup language with a couple of tags (one of which has a couple of attributes) per TOC entry.  If you built the original out of text embeds or individual files per section (not per chapter, which it tries to default to) then it should be easy enough to save each off as HTML. If you didn't chunk that low-level, maybe you want to rebuild your master book file (and source section files) to use more discrete chunks, and then see ow exporting/TOCing works.<br/><br/>All that said... you could probably copy &amp; paste into new HTML files (with minimal tagging for headings) in less time than it takes to rebuild in ID.<br/><br/>This all goes to show: planning for ALL potential deliverables is key, prior to building a book file and chunking content. (Even more so if you are trying to leverage any sort of single-sourcing for several pubs in a library, but that's rare in small-press RPG circles.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293544/#Comment_293544" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-15T18:11:33+00:00" title="September 15, 2010  6:11PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a new Nook owner, and loving it, I am very interested in hearing this!

One problem I'm having is that I don't have access to many readers. So far, I've looked at the epub I made on the iPad, in the Mac version of Cailbre and in Stanza (Mac and iPad), with mixed results.<br/><br/>I'd be obliged if anyone with an interest in this topic would check out the Exodus epub (see link above) in whatever readers they have access to, and tell me problems they see either here or at the link above. Screenshots would be even better.<br/><br/>So far, I can see that there seems to be quite a bit of difference in CSS support among readers. Stanza, for example, centers all the section headers, even though the CSS says not to (or, perhaps, it's just that the default is different. I have to check that). Graphics support also seems to be a bit different (Stanza, for example, doesn't seem to know what to make of the graphic cover, while the others show it just fine).<br/><br/>I haven't seen one that honors CSS2 properties like keep-with-next, which is sort of irritating.<br/><br/>I also notice that if you italicize text using a character style, it tends to work more consistently in the resulting epub than if you just use a keyboard shortcut on the fly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294211/#Comment_294211" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-21T17:12:51+00:00" title="September 21, 2010  5:12PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Going to check this out tomorrow on my BeBook Mini reader.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294245/#Comment_294245" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T04:51:17+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  4:51AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2010 4:53AM by renatoram.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, here I am.

They feel cramped.</li>\n<li>Careful with colors: the examples appear light grey and are just barely readable.</li>\n<li>The Table of Contents is nice, but has some glitches: selecting the "History" group, and then the "History" entry it goes back to the list of groups.</li>\n<li>The illustrations generally work, see later</li>\n<li>The greek text, as expected, work.</li>\n<li>How many circles should I see on each line in the "Fleet Gessen" illustration? I see 9 in portrait mode and 12 in landscape.</li>\n</ul>\nSome suggestions:\n<ul>\n<li>Font embedding: to style a bit more the text consider embedding a font (for the titles, I'd say). Embedding fonts is quite easy and the readers *should* support it, generally. If they don't, it's definitely a bug.</li>\n<li>Vector illustrations: instead of using raster images, especially for the infographics, consider using SVG images. They can be embedded directly in the html or linked as external images, just like png or jpg. The big difference here is that with CSS you can set a percentile size that will always scale with the reader's screen at any zoom level, without ever losing quality due to the resizing. This would fix your problem with the size of the chart on the last page.</li>\n<li>Other embellishments like chapter separators, graphic sidebars, and so on: these, too, can be done with SVG. Just be careful not to overdo it.</li>\n</ul>\nFor a very basic example of SVG embedding, see <a href="http://renatoram.wordpress.com/2010/01/12/vector-illustrations-in-epub-ebooks/" rel="nofollow">this post on my blog</a>. <br/><br/>I have a for-personal-use-only homemade version of Thy Vernal Chieftains, for example, using SVG separators, embedded fonts and SVG character sheets that works much better than the pdf on my reader.<br/><br/>Almost forgetting: the BeBook reader uses the Adobe "ADE" ePub reader software (with support for drm-ed epubs)... which has its known bugs and quirks, but works fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294259/#Comment_294259" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T07:45:19+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  7:45AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you give me a sample of the "the examples appear light grey and are just barely readable"? All of the examples I can think of in the text are exactly the same style and color as the body text. Unless maybe you mean the "notes to myself" text, which wouldn't be in a finished product.<br/><br/>I can't reproduce the behavior you describe with the table of contents. Works fine in the reader's I've tried.<br/><br/>All of the illustrations (other than the Hubble pictures) are actually vector Illustrator sources. You'd think InDesign would convert them to SVG, but it seems hell-bent on rasterizing them. Not sure why.<br/><br/>As for the picture with circles, you should see 13, numbered zero to 12. This image has scaled to fit the screen in every reader I've seen it in.<br/><br/>Regarding font embedding: InDesign's epub export supports this. It also supports custom CSS. It doesn't support both at once. Maybe I'll go back to hand tinkering with the output after export and see what I can do that way. I was trying to avoid that completely. (Or Maybe there are some features in InDesign I don't know about. I would love to find out, for example, that you can edit the definition of an InDesign style to include specific custom CSS at epub export time, so that it embeds that CSS into the style sheet automatically for paragraphs in that style.)<br/><br/>It occurs to me that I have a copy of the ADE reader around someplace, so I'll try that one as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294262/#Comment_294262" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T07:57:51+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  7:57AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect font embedding is rather risky, and it's better to use from the limited selection of fonts available on all major platforms.

If, instead, you let CS5 create the CSS for you, in converts all paragraph styles into their CSS equivalents. I actually want something in-between, where you can override specific styles to tweak the CSS it generates automatically.<br/><br/>As an example, the chapter titles use the Header 1 style. In InDesign, this is defined to be the large white text you see in the PDF, where white makes sense because the text hovers over the image. When exporting to epub, the format can't handle the text floating over the image, so by default it throws the text after the image. If that text remains white, it becomes unreadable, because now it is on a white background. So, I have to override the CSS to make that style use black text instead. It would be nice if CS5 allowed a way, in the definition of the "Header 1" style, that I could say, "this is white text, but when I'm exporting to EPUB, override certain things". If I was building such a feature, I'd add a section to the style editor that gave you a preview of the CSS that would be generated at export, and allow the user to edit it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294274/#Comment_294274" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T08:55:47+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  8:55AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I'd suggest is... stop trying to use InDesign to do ePub. Yes, it can do the grunt work of building the package and 90% of the book, but the fine tuning stuff I'd do by hand. It's very much like trying to use dreamweaver vs doing the coding yourself.<br/>It's really really easy if you know HTML/CSS. <br/><br/>With CSS tricks you can easily do neat stuff like Drop Caps, for example.<br/><br/>A truly ideal workflow, actually, would keep the content and layout separate using some intermediate markup format (like DocBookXML) that can be imported by InDesign for the fully graphical pdf and auto-converted in ePub.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Lester">@Lester</a>: yes, sorry, I checked back and the grey text is the "notes to self" text, actually.<br/><br/>Re: font embedding. <br/>Yes, it can be tricky and is currently very badly (if at all) supported by InDesign. Doing it by hand is quite simple, though. If all you need is some styling on the titles, btw, it's much safer to convert the text to path an save it as standard SVG.<br/><br/>Oh, also, a general heads-up on CSS: never, <i>ever</i> use absolute units and measures. Percentages and ems all the way: you have no idea at all of the nature of the device that will display your text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294276/#Comment_294276" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T08:58:45+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  8:58AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another way InDesign could give me what I wanted would be use the generate CSS feature but, <em>in addition</em> allow me to include a custom sheet after theirs, in which I could override select things.<br/><br/>But, yeah.

However, if you export from InDesign, you can add your extra CSS to the ePub.<br/><br/>The reason I want to try to keep with InDesign followed by minor ePub tinkering is because of version control. I'm hoping that if the InDesign is properly constructed with a consistent naming scheme, images anchored in text and the right ePub export settings, I'll get an ePub file which needs some minor tinkering. This would include (probably) swapping out the CSS, or adding a custom CSS sheet at that stage, then using Calibre to create other mobile formats. If I then update the layout, it will still export OK.
