I want to think about what makes character creation fun. I want to think about what makes character creation a mini-game. I want to think about how to bring techniques and methods from outside the roleplaying tradition into character creation. What I mean is, I want <i>help</i> thinking about these things.<br/><br/>My shining gem in this regard is Breaking the Ice. I still marvel at just how damned fun, creative, and brilliant the CC in this game is. Maybe it just hits my sweet spot for creativity within a framework. I don't think that I just like it for its simplicity, either. I enjoy CC in Burning Wheel, but I don't think it's as good as CC in BtI, in the CC-as-game sense. It works very well for making a good character for Burning Wheel. But BtI works well for making a good character for that game <i>and</i> for having a great amount of fun and a creative experience in character creation. <br/><br/>From the perspective of the roleplaying tradition, the BtI word-association-cloud mechanic for CC came out of left field. It feels like something I did in middle school/high school English classes. What are other places we can mine for CC?<br/><br/>I feel like Emily has set an incredibly high benchmark for CC that I want to come close to reaching or not try to make a game at all. With the idea of making a game in mind, doing CC that retreads old ground just feels boring to me, and saps the life out of my interest in designing a game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206702/#Comment_206702" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T10:19:34+00:00" title="May 11, 2009 10:19AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IAWA has kickass character creation, as does the forthcoming Fiasco.

I'm really fond of Willem Larsen's <a href="http://www.mythic-cartography.org/2009/03/30/the-pedagogy-of-play-bite-sized-pieces-part-iv/" rel="nofollow">character creation process</a> for Polaris, which utilizes the improv game See It/Don't See It. Basically, you describe your character briefly, then everyone randomly contributes details for as long as we can avoid breaking the character with something that just doesn't fit (in which case someone says "I don't see it.") We did it for the Polaris game we started briefly and it was wonderful for generating surprising but fitting ideas we wouldn't have thought of on our own, and its sense of weaving a dream together.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207796/#Comment_207796" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-17T11:05:39+00:00" title="May 17, 2009 11:05AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>Wow, then ALL games have fun  character creation!</blockquote>\nOnly games that people play.<br/><br/>I have the most fun in character generation when I feel like I am:<br/><br/>* Creating an optimal outcome, in a situation where failure is possible. This is most easily understood in terms of mechanical efficiency (minmaxing) but also applies to narrative mechanics -- doing the best possible job of building a character to achieve my particular narrative goals, or choosing the best possible set of characteristics/traits to represent my vision of the character.<br/><br/>* Coming up with surprising/unexpected/counter-intuitive combinations of traits, whether they be preset mechanical abilities, story elements or other personal characteristics. Brainstorming/free-association exercises like in Breaking the Ice are a lot of help for this, <i>but</i> so is a very genre-heavy world with an enormous canonical setting, which provides opportunities to be unusual and surprising in relation to the existing game world (I'm a half-orc thief, yeah!)<br/><br/>* Exploring a complex system with many emergent properties. Again this is easiest to see in a crunchy game like Burning Wheel with the interaction of lifepaths &amp; traits &amp; such, but consider also Shock: or In A Wicked Age, where the initial setup creates a huge complex of interactions &amp; possibilities.<br/><br/>There's probably more but I think those are the big ones, for me.

That is dialing in the suck from the very start.  Before the first die is rolled in the story mode, the game is already "lost" so to speak.  I know you are talking not about failing in getting a bad character, but failing to make that character as potentially useful as he or she should be in combat (the most likely concern of Gamist play).  It just seems like chargen, when done right should always produce a character that will have decent potential in the game itself.<br/><br/>My idea of a good char gen process is one that allows you to model the fictional person I see in my mind's eye and one that gives me some momentum once I start play to get them out there and into some trouble (ahem...adventure).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207824/#Comment_207824" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-17T16:30:14+00:00" title="May 17, 2009  4:30PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>It just seems like chargen, when done right should always produce a character that will have decent potential in the game itself.</blockquote>\nOh, I agree. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy doing it better than someone else. But I would emphasize a few things: first that all my statements started with "feel like", and that the 'someone else' is not an actual person or fellow-player, just some kind of theoretical construct. Anyways, presumably this impulse should only be catered to in a Step on Up situation.<br/><br/>On the other hand I also disagree about the game already being lost: it makes more sense to me to look at it in terms of starting from a more difficult position. I can make a less mechanically effective D&amp;D character than Bob and still achieve greater success once the rubber hits the road by making smarter tactical decisions -- by playing the game better, even if I played the chargen game worse. I think the "already lost" model relies on a false division between chargen &amp; 'the actual game', when it is more realistic to consider them as a continuum of play. Starting with a poorly thought-out character may create a permanent disadvantage but it does not stop you from 'winning' later on, and may of course make the victory all the greater (my half-orc thief survived to level 20, woo!)<br/><br/>(But maybe all I am saying there is that I don't want <i>failure</i> to be possible, I want <i>excellence</i> to be possible.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207858/#Comment_207858" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-17T21:35:45+00:00" title="May 17, 2009  9:35PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>IAWA has kickass character creation, as does the forthcoming Fiasco.

This vague game idea I have in my head involves a book, any book, that a player brings to the table. The table then picks up that book and goes about creating an oracle/pulling characters/situation/setting from the book. This will maybe be coupled with a separate, character-template choosing thing. Marrying those two steps gives me a stronger hand in designing what the game is about, as opposed to just saying "take a book and make some characters, this game can be about anything". It says, "choose these templates; this gives the framework of what the game is about, then do the oracle-thing and add color/situation/setting and specifics to the characters."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207950/#Comment_207950" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T10:57:09+00:00" title="May 18, 2009 10:57AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>[*] As I've also said in the past that IMO DnD has really no chargen procedure or method: it has a chargen book without a guide.

Let's follow along and see what he does..." and then proceeds to show us how Player X assembles a character, and perhaps what is going through this fictional player's mind as he picks character options.<br/><br/>I mean, all versions of D&amp;D that I'm aware of (focusing on 2e, 3e, 4e), they laid out the steps involved in how to craft a character, but didn't show the example of it being done "for the audience".<br/><br/>For audial learners, that's ok, they'll probably get it.<br/>For visual or tactile-kinesthetic learners like me, it's a little harder to grasp.

I like ones that involve the other players or setting somehow (mention to Dogs in the Vineyard, Polaris, Unknown Armies, and others).<br/><br/>The only thing that makes chargen un-fun for me, and this is my own issue, is when a character has skills or 'feat-like' entities with dependencies. That is to say:<br/><br/>1) You have choices in abilities and the like to take.<br/>2) Abilities lead to further abilities. An Ability Tree, where higher abilities require that the character first take lower abilities.<br/>3) But you're encouraged to plan your character well, to be the most effective.<br/>4) So, you have to plan out your "character's future lifepath/career" that he will eventually reach in the game, while you are making your character at first level. ("OK, I want to eventually get Feat X. The lowest level I can get it at is 12. This feat requires me to have those feats, at levels Y and Z. Which means that if I want to take Feat X when I eventually get to 12th Level, I must take Y and 9th, Z at 4th, and that means I need to take only A, B, and C at first level).<br/><br/>I call this "career planning". I hate to do it in real life, so I don't want it in my game-time.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the only system off the top of my head that does this is D&amp;D 3e. It doesn't happen in 4e, which was one of the reasons I took a liking to the new edition so quickly. Also, Ryan S's "E6 Hack" basically hamstringed and gutted this effect, which is why the most fun I had in D&amp;D 3E as a player was when I played using the E6 hack. Less Focus on My character's Future, and more focus on playing him in the moment.<br/><br/>So yeah, if any game comes out where you can get awesome abilities, but to get the awesome ones you need to first take lesser abilities, and to maximize the effect you should do it in a special streamlined order, then I'd probably get the hives from trying to make a character. I don't mind that so much in my console RPGs, because the downtime between chargen and getting those super-powerful-abilities can be like 2-3 days. But in an RPG it can be several months.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208050/#Comment_208050" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T20:15:33+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  8:15PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hansel</cite>Thanks, Joel and Daniel.

The "I don't see it" game isn't in Ben Lehman's text, Willem added it in. If you follow the link to his blog he talks about it in some detail. I do think it works especially well with Polaris because that game has a distinct and evocative aesthetic to its setting, that players can lock into pretty readily and all have their creativity flowing in that same groove. So it makes it particularly easy to "see" the vision as we all shape it, and slip into a kind of dreamtime.<br/><br/>But I'd guess the process would be a welcome addition to character creation in <i>any</i> game where a shared look and feel for characters is desirable.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208235/#Comment_208235" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T19:26:49+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  7:26PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>first that all my statements started with "feel like", and that the 'someone else' is not an actual person or fellow-player, just some kind of theoretical construct.</blockquote>\nThat makes perfect sense.

Likewise, ability plaques are also mixed, and one placed beside each of the revealed race plaques.<br/><br/>When a player selects a race, he may take the bottom race and corresponding ability plaque for free.<br/><br/>If he desires one further along in the row, however, he must place one victory point token onto each race / ability combination he passes over. Thus, if he desires a particular race / ability combination that is further along in the row, it will cost him victory points to obtain it.<br/><br/>If an opponent subsequently opts to take a race that has victory point tokens on it, he also secures those victory points.<br/><br/>This is a VERY clever mechanism that gives players much to consider and eventually makes less attractive races more appealing. </blockquote>\nThere's gotta be some juice there for a character creation system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208395/#Comment_208395" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T16:38:51+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  4:38PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>(though I agree with Ogre, the dice assigning thing feels a bit arbitrary to me too.)</blockquote>\nHere's a suggestion that I just thought of (surely not the first) and will probably take next time I play IAWA: assign them randomly. I've run into the same sort of 'well, meh, uh...' feeling at that point fairly often and usually it means I don't have a solid 'take' on my character's personality quite yet. But part of the beauty of the dice-assignment, to me, is that pretty much every combination works with pretty much any concept to produce a comprehensible character -- there's no way to get it wrong but at the same time the assignation does bring new information to the table about the character.
