The elemental magic in the games works like this: the mage needs to focus on a sample of the element she wants to control (she can bring some water, a particular stone or a torch with her too if needed since the closer to her, the easir to focus on), and then use a word of power to give it a particular shape or use (like wall, circle, arrow, etc)<br/><br/>So combat is solved, but now I'm thinking on how the presence of these mages is affecting society and came up with the idea that most people see them as a resource, as in, if we're living in a small village and one of these guys walks in, we'll throw a party, try to wed him with someone's mighty son or beautiful daughter (remember we're still medieval about these things) and have them make our lives easier. De-frosting crops, gathering water during drought, protecting the town against powerful enemies, etc.<br/><br/>If I were a noble, I'd probably be able to either offer them security, comfort, wealth and education in exchange for his services, or use some nastier means to coerce them into using their abilities to my personal benefice. (there are nastier things in the setting but not all are so useful)<br/><br/>Well, I was wondering what would you think of this and what would it take to make you play such a character. Any ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420710/#Comment_420710" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-26T08:29:00+00:00" title="August 26, 2013  8:29AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fire is an insanely useful thing if it can be controlled - it can clear land for planting, provide light and heat in winter, etc.  But means of controlling fire in your typical fantasy setting are modest at best.

That has a huge effect.  <br/><br/>If anybody with the drive can do it, their value is entirely dependent on their skill.  And if anybody can do it, why doesn't everybody do it?  <br/><br/>If it is a bloodline thing, then their value depends on rarity.  If there are only a handful of known bloodlines, they would probably be akin to royalty- and all that comes with being as powerful as royalty but not the ruling class.  (Unless they actually are nobility or royalty) Bloodlines also raise questions about who has the better bloodline, feuds, inbreeding, and all that fun stuff.  <br/><br/>If it is a difficult and expensive proposition to train to become an elemental mage, then it would be similar to becoming a doctor or lawyer today- middle class families save their entire lives to send a child to school, and the rich send their kids off to school like prized show pets while they have a staff of mages on hand as artisans and soldiers. <br/><br/>Another big thing to consider is how actually useful elemental mages are.  If an Earth mage can build a beautiful stone house in a day or make amazing earthenware pottery from a pile of dirt in the time it take him to move said pile of dirt from the ground to a shelf, then it is pointless for there to be masons, stone carvers, potters, or blacksmiths. Even a partially useful Earth mage would be a factory by themselves.  Air, water, and fire mages could always find work, but they would have to travel to find it, unless fire mages are happy being talking kilns, and air mages are all happy being an engine for a sailing ship.  Is there fatigue?  Can an air mage keep a sailing ship running at top speed for 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week?  How long would it take for an earth (or metal, if you want to break them out) mage outfit an entire army in custom tailored armor and weapons?<br/><br/>I would suggest splitting earth, wood, and metal apart into separate types to make their day-to-day usefulness more in line with the others.  With the exception of powering kilns, furnaces, and ovens, fire mages have to be creative to find truly steady work, but an earth mage would have to be stupid not to be able to find it, even if they have such crappy control they can only do seasonal farm work and then mining the rest of the year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420745/#Comment_420745" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-27T07:35:20+00:00" title="August 27, 2013  7:35AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, the Codex Alera series is a nifty example of the sorts of things that elemental mages could use their magic for, on a practical level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420759/#Comment_420759" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-27T10:26:44+00:00" title="August 27, 2013 10:26AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice ideas, everyone! Well, I was taking Tenra\xb4s setting, but without elemental mages in it. All elemental mages in the setting come from another continent, Gaia, (which was kind of nuked on our previous campaign) making most gaians undesirable refugees. Except for the most powerful or useful ones, of course. Elemental mages are born apparently randomly only among gaians, so this form of magic can't be taught nor inherited, making them quite rare. An elemental mage can manipulate all elements, though only one at a time and needs a sample of that element to be nearby in order to bond to the nature and then focus his powers.<br/><br/>Elemental mages manipulate the raw powers of nature, so it's really hard for them to fine tune their abilities for things like pottery or house building. Yet, they can make themselves quite useful for minning, lumbering, farming, and forging, replacing the use of heavy machinery. Not that Tenrans don't already have these, but it certainly doesn't hurt to have an extra hand, speed and versatility for all this.<br/><br/>Since it's already been like ten years since Gaians started to flee to Tenra, there's a high chance that a Gaian Elemental mage could be raised by Tenrans and grown up accustomed to their traditions and culture. Any institution like a Guild would be really small and most probably non-influential since it'd be under heavy surveillance by the noblemen sponsoring it. However it'd make sense that every group and institution would be quite interested in having one or more among their ranks, so it'd be rare for them to find a way of having a quiet life unless they go underground, quite fal and stop using their powers at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
