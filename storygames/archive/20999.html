With the protection of the Guild, you need not fear retribution once you escape the scene of the crime - the scrubbers have your back. Every trace of you, every piece of camera footage, everyone who will testify that you were there will vanish without a trace.<br/><br/>All that falls to you is the kill itself and, in that, you're an expert.<br/><br/>Choose from a variety of weapons, armour and equipment and suppliment them with superhuman abilities such as controlling fire, slowing time or even messing with gravity or the Strong Nuclear Force!<br/><br/>Let nothing stand between you and your target.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shadesofvengeance/era-hitman" rel="nofollow">Join us on Kickstarter for \xa35!</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460845/#Comment_460845" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-03T02:38:32+00:00" title="March  3, 2017  2:38AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ed,<br/><br/>I hope your Era line of games is doing well!  You've put out a bunch in the last several months -- I admire your productivity!<br/><br/>I did notice you haven't had many replies here, and that might be because other people are getting the sense I'm getting: you only show up to Story-Games.com to pitch your own games.  There's no formal rule against that, but I don't think it's the best way to get positive attention around here.  If you stick around the forum a bit, and find some threads where you have some passion for the topics, and chime in, folks might be more interested in checking out your Era threads.  No guarantees, but it's a thought.  It'd also be a little more in keeping with the general spirit of this place.<br/><br/>So, Hitman: I assume form the pitch that we have multiple players playing multiple hitmen.  Do they work together?  Or do we alternate between them as they do separate jobs?<br/><br/>Best,<br/>-Dave                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460846/#Comment_460846" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-03T05:24:00+00:00" title="March  3, 2017  5:24AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am also a bit confused by the pitch.

The PCs are <i>a party of</i> hitmen going after a very important target, and that target has security in place: walls, guards, even guards who are powerful combatants with psychic powers just like the PCs'.<br/><br/>Sounds like the kind of over-the-top action movie where one or more larger-than-life, hyper-badass main characters attack Big Boss HQ and murder a zillion mooks until they get to Big Boss Himself and murder him, duh, and I'm sure they've mentioned a reason why they definitely had to, but I wasn't paying attention, sorry, distracted looking at the explosions. I can think of a couple such films that I actually like, though, including a Bruce Lee one. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460855/#Comment_460855" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-03T10:02:41+00:00" title="March  3, 2017 10:02AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love the art, would dearly love to know more about the game, the rule system and everything else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461207/#Comment_461207" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-20T17:31:37+00:00" title="March 20, 2017  5:31PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a guideline, driving-by to post your kickstarter and not interacting with people interested in your game is not how directed promotion should work here. <br/><br/>Future examples of this will result in deletes/bans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
