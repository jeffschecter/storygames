Not a extremely traditional SR campaign for the majority of the time... much more dealing with the world and corp, ganger, world politics and headed for an epic sort of event.<br/><br/>I definately do want to use the newest SR5 rules normally but I'd like to kick things off with a focus on the PC's backgrounds and the intricacies of relationships PC to PC and to NPCs.<br/><br/>So...  I am considering using FIASCO to kick off the very first session.<br/>I've seen some of the FIASCO Shadowrun play-sets so I'll be using those to build my own campaign play-set specific to the PCs and my story plan.<br/><br/>My question for your advice is:<br/><br/>Do you have any suggestions for a longer term campaign that will be set up by a FIASCO in general?<br/>Do you have any points to watch with playing a FIASCO in general (I've only tried it once and none of my players have)  for new players that are more used to traditional play, the pitfalls or confusions they may have?<br/><br/>Here's some plot elements if you have any juice suggestions to incorporate into the normal structure of a FIASCO play-set:<br/><br/><br/>Location:  DETROIT,  2076 - a massive New Years eve celebration combined with a Shadowrun-tech style "auto-show" or E3 type event unveiling new auto and Ares tech.  From industrial magnates, to inventors, to politicians and major celebritites all are invited to this high profile event atop the REN CEN in downtown Detroit.<br/><br/>NOTE:  Detroit in Shadowrun canon is "Ares-ville" and is actually prosporus, one of the better cities in the world with 2% unemployment. Shadowrunners are rare. It's ripe for a massive mess up.<br/><br/>The cataclysmic event to kick the campaign:  3 teams of runners have been hired (by who??) to infiltrate and take over the REN CEN in a "Die Hard" style seige.  The big "bomb" they're setting off is a virus to infiltrate all of Ares-mainframe ... it's called the "SIN Eater".  It essentially does a Blank Slate (via The Dark Knight Returns movie),  deleting EVERYONE's SIN (real or fake) who has accessed an Ares-Mainframe in Detroit recently.  Which is essentially anyone that's been to Detroit in the last 4-5 months  since  Ares has a hand in every aspect of Detroit life.<br/>What this means?  <br/>No SINs = no access to any personal items/property or accounts.  Basically making Detroit (now) one of the worst cities open to Shadowrun missions, theft, riots, etc... Basically a more real version of Detroit.<br/><br/><br/>So...  Ares CEO has gathered the PCs  (who had different reasons to attend the REN CEN event)  in his boardroom and has asked them to get him (and board memebers/families = 12-18 people) OUT of the building!   DIE HARD style.<br/><br/><br/>How would you use all that to turn it into a classic FIASCO play-set game?  <br/>What would you add or change?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432916/#Comment_432916" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-22T07:29:16+00:00" title="May 22, 2014  7:29AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Identify one Need that rests between two player characters, that's the only clear thing you're missing.<br/><br/>I think you might be a bit disappointed unless you switch from Fiasco to SR immediately after The Tilt - the whole reason Fiasco works so well is because there's a solid ending that simply can't be avoided. To achieve your characters goals/desires/Need you need to do something right the fuck now. In SR or other ongoing, long-term games you don't have that system-enforced urgency.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432917/#Comment_432917" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-22T07:47:11+00:00" title="May 22, 2014  7:47AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another possibility is that you play the Fiasco game through to it's conclusion but then you only use the resulting story as background for your Shadow Run game- the surviving Fiasco characters and their ill-advised adventures become backstory for the SR characters, in the same way that <i>Neuromancer</i> was background for <i>Count Zero</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432919/#Comment_432919" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-22T10:24:22+00:00" title="May 22, 2014 10:24AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...I should probably say something here because I did the <i>exact same thing</i>...<br/><br/>My rationale with the Fiasco playsets was to create relationships between the PCs. I suppose I could have just had them roll for relationships and quit there, but I believe that a shared history that you have played out is superior to one you have merely outlined. It may not always work, but in my case the random factor introduced a couple of useful and cool twists.<br/><br/>Mechanically, this is what I think you should look for/hack:<br/><br/>1) My preference &amp; belief is that it will work better as a shared background/backstory rather than starting play after Act I. But I could be wrong! Experiment :-)<br/><br/>2) Be careful with the list of relationships, try and prune &amp; rewrite them (if using an existing playset) so that they don't break your suspension of disbelief too hard.<br/><br/>3) Ditto for locations, which for me were often the hardest things to come up with when writing the playset.<br/><br/>4) I recommend using the Soft Tilt, to avoid having to roll up a new clone right away.<br/><br/>5) Likewise, you probably want to ignore or modify the Aftermath table.<br/><br/>6) Experiment--for one of my playsets, I made all the locations <i>events</i> in an NPC's life--so they had a temporal axis as well.<br/><br/>For my game, I wrote my own playsets. These are my two favorites--one <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOTzBrdkkwdXFfcGc/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">radically restricted space</a> (almost all the locations are in a single Gatsby-esque mansion) and the other <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOa21JNUtKdEhZT0E/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">radically expanded time</a> (as noted above.)<br/><br/>Both of them should included my hacked Soft Tilt table and heavily modified Aftermaths.<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432922/#Comment_432922" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-22T12:25:25+00:00" title="May 22, 2014 12:25PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Another possibility is that you play the Fiasco game through to it's conclusion but then you only use the resulting story as background for your Shadow Run game- the surviving Fiasco characters and their ill-advised adventures become backstory for the SR characters, in the same way that <i>Neuromancer</i> was background for <i>Count Zero</i>.</blockquote>\nI like this.

Part of playing Fiasco is the willingness to see your character be an idiot, or a foil for another character, and, in any case, likely crash and burn because they were an idiot. If people are getting invested in these characters as the potential heroes of a future RPG campaign, they may have difficulties with this aspect of the game.<br/><br/>So somehow disconnecting one part of the game from the other is important (the "movie" concept is good, or using the Fiasco story as a background story to the coming events). Of course, given a group that's into the idea and all on the same page, playing it straight could be fun, too. But you have to accept, then, that the challenge will be making a potentially very pathetic character into someone more respectable. The tension here is that Fiasco is fundamentally about losers: usually, no one looks too good by the end of a Fiasco story. (Although I've seen people "win" Fiasco; those characters usually come off as villains, though sometimes also as lucky accidents.) But Shadowrun is all about style and being badass. So there's a contradiction.<br/><br/>I like the idea of getting the whole group on board with this as a creative challenge, myself: first drive your character into the deepest pits of incompetence, idiocy, and misfortune, and then try to redeem them from that position as a Shadowrun character. But it won't be super-smooth.<br/><br/>Secondly:<br/><br/>I know lots of people love Fiasco (and I think it's a great game myself), but it does and can present a huge challenge sometimes. The game is so freeform that your group needs pretty high-level creative and interpersonal skills to make it work. It's hardly an RPG from any kind of "traditional" viewpoint.<br/><br/>Read the Fiasco book, and the Fiasco Companion, if you haven't already, and watch the Tabletop episode (on YouTube); that will be very helpful if you haven't played before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432928/#Comment_432928" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-22T14:49:22+00:00" title="May 22, 2014  2:49PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes to what <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> said.<br/><br/>Also, you should expect that Fiasco used as a prelude--especially my "killed virus" version--isn't gonna be as good as regular Fiasco.
