You can "bank" the improvements to use that at appropriate moments in play. (This is how it works in The Shadow of Yesterday, which is where this character advancement model seems to come from.)<br/><br/>As a notable exception/difference, Monsterhearts (an Apocalypse World hack) specifies that you cannot collect any more experience until you've chosen an improvement. It wouldn't surprise me all that much if I found out that some people play Apocalypse World this way too.<br/><br/>Edit: My preferred way is that the improvement kicks in immediately (even in the middle of a fight, whatever) unless the group feels it would be totally jarring (for example, taking control of a gang: you can't apply that all of a sudden if the character's alone in someone's basement -- at least not usually, that is).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RaconteurX" title="RaconteurX"><img alt="RaconteurX" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RaconteurX">RaconteurX</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412249/#Comment_412249" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-18T20:39:45+00:00" title="April 18, 2013  8:39PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2013 8:39PM by RaconteurX.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, Paul; immediately works best unless it's too jarring in context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412263/#Comment_412263" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-19T05:14:22+00:00" title="April 19, 2013  5:14AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We just introduce it immediately.

Where am I? Who am I? I have no idea, even my name tag (on my uniform) is blank. <br/><br/>Someone is lying there, shot, dead or dying. I don't know who they are, but I know they got shot because of me. How can I help them? <br/><br/>I turn to the first person who's there who seems to know what's going on. "Who am I?" I ask hir. <br/><br/>"You... are the Messiah." The weirdo answers. "Bring him back!"<br/><br/>What?!? Uh, ok, let me try...<br/><br/>So, I reach down and put my hands on him. "Uh, come back to life! ... I guess." <br/><br/>Meanwhile, I've just scored my fifth experience. So I announce that I'm taking the "healing touch" move, and roll. The dead guy comes back to life!<br/><br/>And so, just like that, it turns out I <i>am</i> the Messiah. The crazy Brainer was right.<br/><br/>The game ended prematurely, but I'm pretty sure the Quarantine was headed towards a switch to the Hocus playbook...<br/><br/><br/><br/>(Healing touch? Never would have chosen that were I just idly picking moves from the book, as you can imagine. But you "play to find out what happens", so there it was.

Assuming the MC still follows all the principles and such, otherwise it'd be cheating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412401/#Comment_412401" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-22T07:01:30+00:00" title="April 22, 2013  7:01AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No. That sounds like a very bad idea to me.

It forces you to get enjoyment out of advancing the character instead of the character's abilities (which I find much more rewarding).

Leveling up mechanics always fly in the face of logic, even logic of the fiction that is presented.  A character should be getting weaker and more tired from constant strain and stress.  Most of the above examples have characters getting stronger and overcoming the final challenge coming off the tail end of a stressful and challenging ordeal.  They should be weaker, but they are stronger and have inexplicably pulled a new trick from up their sleeve.  I find it as hard to believe as someone who learned how to swim by driving cars for 30 years.

I totally agree with this, and I think that a lot of (or most) RPGs tend to include "character advancement" simply because it was part of the standard/D&amp;D model, which is unfortunate. I like games without this kind of character advancement, and most of my own designs have limited advancement or none at all (or sometimes allow you to reconfigure your character rather than add things).<br/><br/>However, in Apocalypse World I feel like character advancement is a really powerful and interesting tool which is one of the drivers for the game's drama.<br/><br/>A big part of this is how it is often qualitative rather than quantitative. For instance, I think the most significant and dramatic advance is "change to another playbook". It reshapes the story and shows how it has changed the character. Move choices similarly change the direction of the story in significant ways: consider what happens when the Angel in your game, who has a bunch of important people under his care, takes the "touched by death" move!<br/><br/>This is a really powerful way for the players to communicate with each other and push the story in different directions. It forces the characters to change and for their interaction with the world to take new forms, which drives the story to develop further and in different directions. This is especially clear in the "advanced moves" (like making allies, seeing beyond the maelstrom, and so on).<br/><br/>Purely mechanical improvements (like many "add to a stat" or "stat substitution" moves) are much less interesting to me (and I could even see removing them from the game as an option), but they too serve an important purpose. They allow us, as a group, to raise the stakes as we move through the story: the protagonists might not have the power to change the world at the beginning of the campaign, or they might try and fail, but when it comes down to the last straw and they confront whatever is facing them, they have a chance of prevailing.<br/><br/>There is no point to try to explain this via "in-game logic", it's purely a dramatic conceit. I like to pretend that the characters have no idea that Keeler's hard went from 0 to +2: no, it's just that in this story she's finally gritting her teeth and has grown a backbone and finally things are going her way more often, because she's suffered enough and the story will end when she finally gets to do whatever it was she was too afraid to do at the beginning. The characters outgrow their humbler beginnings and eventually face those conflicts which have truly major stakes--this is how stories typically work, and in a game like AW, mechanical improvements are just a tool which helps us get there more easily as we play.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412554/#Comment_412554" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T11:10:28+00:00" title="April 24, 2013 11:10AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The simple solution is to just ask the question.

FWIW I'm totally happy to play in systems with no advancement but I think AW has taught me that developing (improving) a character is insufficient, that character has to change over the course of their story.</blockquote>\nMy suggestion for you is to look at how Inspectres handles the issue.  You are building a dice pool in that case that allows you to add more capability to your character, but it doesn't fundamentally change the character on a mechanical level.  You can do anything you can without your franchise dice that you can with them, you just have a better chance of success with them.  The advancement of the story and your relationships is where the game is fun and it tends to be the only way to keep people interested in it.  It makes it so you don't have to drive for 30 hours straight in order to learn how to swim (I've done that in a D20 Modern game).  <br/><br/>I think XP systems fundamentally are made in order to restrict what a player can do.  I have played tons of games that use XP and EXP, and the formula is always the same, whenever the players start to get the characters that they want to have in the story, the story ends.  In every example above I see the game coming to an end when the players could finally play how they wanted to, and I for one am tired of playing 3 months of pre-game in order to do what I wanted to do from the beginning in 1-3 sessions.  Why not skip it and just have a good short game without having to do any of the XP farming?<br/><br/>I challenge you with the same thing that I said to the other posters... try it with a bunch of characters advanced to whatever point your group agrees to and leave the XP out of it.  I predict that your game will be shorter but more memorable.  It was with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412599/#Comment_412599" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T18:27:58+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  6:27PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never had an AW or *W character that I felt needed advancement.

Every example above has a pretty dramatic advancement in my book.  Someone learning they can heal raise the dead when they had no idea before they advanced was one such example.  I would categorize this as  a sudden advancement that is kind of out of left feild, and it is what I find to be diss associative to the fiction I see being put forward.  The person in that example never tired to raise dead people before or heal injured people before.  He just farmed XP till he could do what he actually wanted to do.  That is my point.<br/><br/>I am not saying that XP systems don't pace a game, but there are better ways to do it if that is what you are after.  Dogs in the Vineyard does a pretty good job of it, in my opinion.  Every XP system just feels like the MC is holding that carrot in front of you to stimulate your interest.  That implies a lack of substance in the story to me.  I acknowledge individual experience may differ and different tastes prevail.  I respect that, and I would like you to tell me why this is so appealing to you.  I honestly never got the appeal of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412610/#Comment_412610" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T20:31:04+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  8:31PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One of the assertions of the article is that advancements in AW are not dramatic.</blockquote>\nThis is not something I have asserted anywhere, ever, much less in the post referenced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412620/#Comment_412620" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T22:41:33+00:00" title="April 24, 2013 10:41PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2013 10:46PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I mean is that I've never felt the need to grind to get advances in AW. I've played a lot of one-shots of AW, more than I care to recount, I have never felt like my character needed more than the starting moves to be playable or to be where I wanted them to be. <br/><br/>Sudden advancement works the same as an unexpected character reveal in most other media. Whether or not it works is contextual. If it doesn't follow the fiction, then that's not the rules fault, it's the players. If it breaks your immersion that bad, stop play and have a discussion about the fiction and tone.<br/><br/>As for Dogs, it's advancement totally breaks down after like three Towns.<br/><br/>The problem with starting with five advances (which means most playbooks have seven moves to pick) is that it's a lot of handling time and terrible learning curve. It's too many options at the start of play. Moreover, AW characters are already sufficient characters. Advancement simply makes their terrible tools slightly more effective. <br/><br/>Like, it's a game about community and the only meaningful tools you have mechanically are violence and manipulation. Which is advancement is fun, because you can play to find out what happens with your character, and you can grow and reveal your character in play rather than impossibly trying to front load all that shit. <br/><br/>Anyways, as for the rest of the discussion, I think Johnstone answers the question of advancement in AW and its derivatives and proposes excellent alternatives in his Black Seas for people who don't care about advancement. <br/><br/>However, I seriously wonder if you read his post closely given your understanding it. When he uses the term 'dramatic' he's talking about scale and not, like, <i>drama</i>. Like, a 20th level DnD character is dramatically more effective than a 1st level one. This is not the case in AW. Advances are interesting but they don't operate on the same curve as Leveling does in many other games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412655/#Comment_412655" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T09:48:35+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  9:48AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SteveDave, modern culture just contains a whole lot of "meta", a lot of breaking the fourth wall.  We live in a crazy mashed-up postmodern world where real gangsters pattern themselves on movie gangsters and somebody else makes another movie about <i>those </i>gangsters.  <br/><br/>Indie games in particular tend to have a strong meta element, and the *World games do too.  If you and your group don't care for such a strong meta element, you can play it down and really emphasize putting the fiction first and making sure that advances fit into your shared vision of the setting.  If you don't like the idea of a character suddenly getting magic spells because the player spent XP, don't do that in your game!  I don't like that idea either and I wouldn't allow it if I were GM'ing.<br/><br/>I have to disagree with your idea that people don't get better at things, because they often do.

Action movie characters advance when "Eye of the Tiger" starts playing in the background and you are about to watch Rocky run up the stairs.  This is implied that an amount of time has past where they spent a lot of time and effort developing those skills.  Most other movies start with someone who is already awesome and they are put in a scenario where their skills are being tested.  I can't think of one where there is a sudden development of skills happened out of nowhere for no reason.  The no reason is what I take issue with, not the change.<br/><br/>I already said I am not looking for total immersion, but it made no sense within the context of the fiction.  Your character didn't get the XP by having a alien device shine on him, finding an ancient artifact, meditating on a collection of spells, or delving into the science of the mind.  He did it by however he got the XP, which may or may not have had anything to do with healing abilities. <br/><br/>Your character's healing touch could not have been done before you got the XP.  That is something that he couldn't do before that now he can because, why not?  If he had tried to heal someone before he got the XP, it would have failed.  That is a mechanical change, however you try to justify it within the fiction.  <br/><br/>At the end of the day, I don't see this as being any different than killing 1,000 rats in D&amp;D to get to level 2 so that you can lay on hands.  At the core, its still farming for XP in order to get what I really want.  You couldn't heal people before the XP, so you did what you need to do to get it because you felt the character was uninteresting, not spectacular enough, or not mechanically valuable enough.  Why not start with what you want?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave" title="SteveDave"><img alt="SteveDave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/267/nLSFO0MJD2Z0T.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave">SteveDave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412702/#Comment_412702" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T14:58:47+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  2:58PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>SteveDave, modern culture just contains a whole lot of "meta", a lot of breaking the fourth wall.  We live in a crazy mashed-up postmodern world where real gangsters pattern themselves on movie gangsters and somebody else makes another movie about <i>those </i>gangsters.  <br/><br/>Indie games in particular tend to have a strong meta element, and the *World games do too.  If you and your group don't care for such a strong meta element, you can play it down and really emphasize putting the fiction first and making sure that advances fit into your shared vision of the setting.  If you don't like the idea of a character suddenly getting magic spells because the player spent XP, don't do that in your game!  I don't like that idea either and I wouldn't allow it if I were GM'ing.<br/><br/>I have to disagree with your idea that people don't get better at things, because they often do.  Young adults join the military and come out of training as medics, snipers, or truck mechanics; after a few years and a deployment, they're usually much better at their jobs because they've seen how to use their training in real-world situations and they've mastered the things they learned in training.  </blockquote>\nIt seems about as meta as D&amp;D.  Kill 1,000 rats and get to level 2 where you can heal wounds because why not?<br/><br/>I am not saying things don't improve (that is an easy point to disprove), just they don't improve on the spot.  They take young men and put them through training before they are medics, snipers, or truck mechanics. My point is one does not suddenly develop skills or talents without training or some logical reason... unless you collect enough XP.  There is no distinction on how you acquired that XP or what advancements you can make make with it.  <br/><br/>Working on trucks aught to help you fix trucks, right?  In real life, we would all say yes, but in game logic, the answer is "no, it somehow makes you a better sniper." There has been no attempt within the mechanics to reconcile that.  I say that presents a bigger issue if you try to reconcile it because then you are making inconsistencies in your story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412712/#Comment_412712" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T16:15:26+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  4:15PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The type of character that changes over the course of a narrative, the one with a story arc, is the dramatic character. The other type of character, the one that stays true to themselves in the face of adversity and overcomes by not changing, is the kind that isn't dramatic (it has a name that people use but I don't remember what it is). So, by definition, characters that employ advancement or improvement mechanics are dramatic characters.<br/><br/>A 20th level wizard has more spells than even a well-organized person can keep track of, including spells like wish, where a 1st level wizard has one spell. And the 20th level wizard has about ten times as many hit points. So in either sense of the word, it's a more dramatic change than what you get from an AW character after 10 improvements, because those two AW character can still co-exist comfortably in a game. The 20th level wizard sees a 1st level wizard and just says "why are you even here?" But <i>less</i> dramatic doesn't equal <i>not</i> dramatic.<br/><br/>The reason, I think, that Orlando wanted you to read that post of mine is because I give three good reasons for having an improvement system in a game:<br/>1. A long-term story arc.<br/>2. The desire to obtain xp and advance can be used to encourage behaviours that the game needs to function.<br/>3. The player can dictate changes to their character from the POV of the player, during play.<br/><br/>(And the fourth reason, in the second half of the post, was specific to games we were designing at the time and not relevant here.)<br/><br/>Judging from the posts you've made in this thread, it seems like none of these are your bag? I mean, the point of that post wasn't to make value judgments on any of these or to say these are necessary -- only that if you want any of these three, an advancement system is one way to go about it, and that if none of these are good enough reasons to have an advancement system... then don't have one. You don't have to like an of these things and you don't have to like advancement systems. It is okay.<br/><br/>What you can't do, though, is reject these as legitimate reasons for advancement. It's good we have games where we can "start at awesome" and I like these, but I also play a lot of slow and brutal old school D&amp;D and there is a tremendous sense of accomplishment that comes with long-term exploration and levelling-up. Provided it is also fun, and not repetitive grinding of wolf-kill quests, but if it was that I wouldn't still be playing.<br/><br/>Likewise, the desire for xp in old school D&amp;D drives the game amazingly well, but it's also a powerful incentive in AW. When a player tries their hardest to only roll their highlighted moves during a session, the people I play with call this "Johnstone's disease," but when I do this it's partly the challenge of finding ways to use these stats that appease the person who highlighted the stat but are also character-appropriate AND don't fuck up the flow of the game.<br/><br/>The third one is one of the things people can mean when they say improvements can have a cinematic quality to them. You play the character as the character for a little while, and then you step back and say "you know, I want to change something so I can explore a different part of this character." The other one is the one time where improvements are technically un-dramatic, which is when they reveal an aspect of the character that we, the players and audience, have not yet seen. After three sessions, the Savvyhead could take augury for her workspace and just say it was there all this time and she just hadn't used it yet. The Brainer could take In-Brain Puppet Strings or both +1 hard advancements after barely ever rolling+hard and just say, "this was me all along, I was being soft on y'all." I don't think there have been any examples of this kind of advancement in the thread so far because the tank and lay on hands improvements were changes, so they were dramatic, but both are examples of additions to the shared narrative from a player perspective, not a character perspective. Which is something you don't get in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>The actual justification for the advancement is just that -- a justification. Finding treasure doesn't really make you a better fighter but we don't care, we want to play D&amp;D the way we play it so we just say it's a way to measure how you get better from practicing dungeoncrawling. Advances in AW are essentially a reward for participating, and many people like that reward, whether it's a story-arc (and whether you call 10-15 sessions long- or short-term is up to you), or a feeling of accomplishment, or new toys to play with, or the ability to dictate certain aspects of the fiction. People can't always articulate why it's rewarding, either, even when it obviously is for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412714/#Comment_412714" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T16:25:06+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  4:25PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And on the issue of whether that feels organic or paced right or whether it makes sense to the players or even whether everyone at the same game can all like it, I don't think this is really a function of the game.

I won't say they simulate a narrative, because they don't have a dramatic curve or anything built into them. But they do simulate a piece of fiction. Especially the important distinction of "this is decidedly true", "this is decidedly not true", and "this has not been determined yet".<br/><br/>When a PC does not have the Healing touch move, of course he doesn't have the ability. If you'd try to lay on hands and look expectantly at the MC, they'd make a hard move. But if you don't try, and then take the advancement, it is not the case that your character suddenly (and apparently for everyone watching in-game) went from "not healing touch" to "healing touch". The fact that you could not heal with a touch was not an established fact, just like the fact that there was no hidden tank in that garage. We just didn't know what was in there.<br/><br/>If you play an otherwise weird character, like a hocus or savvyhead or brainer (or any class if you play up that side and open your brain a lot), it is not hard to keep this option open. In order for the advancement to not feel out-of-the-blue when you take it, you (the player) have to keep in mind what moves from other playbooks you can see yourself taking. If you know that you're going to want Healing touch somewhere down the line, play your character as the type who could seriously, i a moment of desperation, just place their hands on a wounded comrade and pray to the maelstrom. Then when you're in that situation and have an advance, bam! You use Healing touch.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, the fiction of your game (for whatever reason, maybe your Angel player said so when asked by the MC) stated that the Healing touch is something that the weird albino tribe in the south have, you're going to have a harder time justifying it. If you want to take that advance, it's on you to make it work (but the others, including MC, are allowed to help and I know I would if I were MCing). The fiction has to acknowledge the fact that "hey, we all thought only albino southerners could do that but know this guy does. What's up with that?" And that's just the same as when, I'm pressed for a good example, General Grievous uses lightsabers despite not being a Jedi. The rules simulate a fiction, and if you acknowledge that what's established in the ficton must be respected but other stuff need not, then you're good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412946/#Comment_412946" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-28T05:55:03+00:00" title="April 28, 2013  5:55AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think too that the mechanical advantage of the advance, the +1stat or new move or whatever just makes that narrative possibility more likely within your story, not necessarily the character getting fictionally 'better'. Its a means for the player to flag what they are interested in playing throughout an emergent story. This will change from advance to advance, and is part of the fun of playing! Its not so much about having an arc we'd like to see played out and aiming our advances toward that (from the beginning), but rather excited to see just how the interplay between emergent story and player choices shape the 'slow reveal' of the playbooks we felt drawn too during the first session chargen.<br/><br/>Its not so much about 'levelling up' the characters, as it is 'levelling up the fiction'; as in what new and exciting advances can we narratively add (as a group) to the story... as a means to temper the slow burn story arc over many many sessions. There is a strong interplay between the advances players choose (often in consultation with the other players) as they examine the fiction, the stats highlighted by other players for xp and the moves brought into this fictional space, both player and MC moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412998/#Comment_412998" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-28T20:22:16+00:00" title="April 28, 2013  8:22PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And that's precisely what makes AW advancement so much more interesting than, say, D&amp;D advancement to me.<br/><br/>It's not about your character getting better. <br/><br/>Why not just make the character you want to play from the beginning, rather than making him weaker and then "leveling up"?<br/><br/>That's not (to me) how AW works.
