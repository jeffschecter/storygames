It should be apparent that I like to tinker with tsoy. Tell me to stop if you don't feel like commenting <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>This rule module is for cases where massing troops and commanding them to the battle is the beef. Usually tsoy is an x-opera and war is just another background for characters to deal with their issues and this is good. But for those times that you want to deal with your issues by marching your legions across the plains, <br/>try these:<br/><br/>The troops<br/>Troops are represented as NPC:s and they have specific skill assigned to them:<br/><b>Skill of Battle</b> <br/>Fighting battles is the default task for unit of troops. It also measures morale, equipment and ability march dig ditches.<br/><br/>To attain troops you need contacts and resources. If you are using my resource rules, test your resources against their battle skill to see <br/>if you can provide for them. <br/><br/><b>Secret Of Commander</b><br/>You know people who know military people. You can test contacting skill to recruit and refit unit of troops. They start out with Battle score of<br/>0. After which you can spend your XP to buy their Battle skill. If your troop is vanquished or disbanded you get the XP back. You can also<br/>provide your troops with secrets and assisting skills (like woodcraft for example)<br/><br/>The battles are fought by testing the battle rolls against each other as per normal rules. There are some skills and secrets that allow<br/>commanders to provide bonus dice.<br/><br/>There are also skills regarding command. There are usual tactics and strategy and possibly the following:<br/><br/><b>Skill of Scouting</b> <br/>You know how to arrange for patrols to keep your troops safe from enemy surprises and guerillas. This skill acts as a counter for such tests<br/><br/><b>Skill of Logistics</b><br/>The ability to move and keep moving troops. If there is room for manouvering in strategic scale it can also be used to race<br/>or blitz (gives bonus dice for battle).<br/><br/>Then onto the beef, that is skills for leading the army. They are split apart for maximum crunch and if you don't want to pull a game focusing<br/>on battles and warfare, you might consider replacing these by just "Tactics" and be done with it. <br/><br/>(Additional rationale: <br/>tactics is about assigning resources in best possible manner. This means that you need to have choices like: "Le Aberd\xc3\xa9en is master of assaults - this means that we really need to muster a good defensive troop like The Sixth with perhaps Duke of Liverpool on the van..")<br/><br/><b>Skill of Flanking</b><br/>You are apt at compromising enemy flanks with your troops. You can test your Flanking skill to provide for bonus dice for battle rolls. <br/>Opposition can test Scouting to block this (if they succeed you receive no bonus dice). If the opposition is Holding the Line they incur a penalty die.<br/><br/><b>Skill of Assaults and Charges</b><br/>You know how to lead and plan an assault. You can use this skill to provide bonus dice to you troops battle roll when leading the charge. If opposition is Flanking you they incur a penalty die.<br/><br/><b>Skill of Holding the Line</b><br/>You can formulate defenses in excellent manner. When on defense, this skill can be used to provide bonus dice for your troops roll. If the opposition is Assaulting, they incur a penalty die.<br/><br/>And then to some secrets for those who command differently:<br/><br/><b>Secret of REMF</b><br/>You know how to keep yourself out of the fray and thus will never incur physical harm when leading the battle.<br/>Cost: 2 Reason<br/><br/><b>Secret of Ambushes</b><br/>You can arrange sizeable troops to provide ambushes. You can versus test scouting skill for bonus dice to battle rolls.<br/><br/><b>Secret of Aggravated Assault</b><br/>When you make you make an assault you know how to make it so that your men literally foam at their mouths running at the foe. Opponent cannot test for flanking, there just is no time!<br/>Cost: 1 Reason<br/><br/><b>Secret of Formidable Defense</b><br/>When you make you make a defensive line it stays a line come hell or high water. Opponent cannot test for Assault - you will break them at your<br/>wall of men!<br/>Cost: 1 Reason<br/><br/><br/>Well.. Thats it for now. I need to think up some harm-cards for the troops and perhaps a dozen or more secrets for crunch. Also I've been pondering, what if I'd split the troop types into three as well? Ie. types that favour either footmen, bowmen and cavalry and making similar triangle as in the command skills where footmen give a penalty die for opposing  bows, which give a penalty die for cavalry which give penalty die for footmen.. Too complex already? And that would give you secrets for <br/>cavalry specialists and longbows..<br/><br/>Once more:  If the players are not the ones commanding the armies don't use these rules. Then they are just baggage. Otherwise, have fun with mercenary action or vying for control of the Kingdom.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74768/#Comment_74768" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-10T05:58:39+00:00" title="June 10, 2007  5:58AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2007 6:03AM by oliof.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There has been a line of discussion regarding this on the forge; you might want to take a look <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23421.0" rel="nofollow">here</a> for some ideas that sprang from discussing multiple participants. Also, there was a concept posted for <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23291.0" rel="nofollow">playing tribes</a> using the TSoY rules.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd look at the rules as is to provide the means you seek to model with your rules addition. IMHO, all of the skills and secrets are already represented by the <i>Battle</i> Skill, special tactics expressed by a <i>Secret of Specialization</i> (i.e.: Battle; Secret of Specialization: Flanking) and defined by the attached fighty skill, be that <i>Infantry</i> or <i>Guerilla Warfare</i>. Instead of Aggravated Assault, I'd take <i>Secret of the Flashing Knife</i> and apply that to the <i>Battle</i> or <i>Infantry</i> skill \xe2\u20ac\u201c bam! instant Blitzkrieg tactics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Discordian" title="Discordian"><img alt="Discordian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Discordian">Discordian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75265/#Comment_75265" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T04:48:44+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  4:48AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah. I'll look into it. Though the deal for me is not multiple participants, it is about leading units.<br/><br/>And yes, I agree that rules as is can already model this, but they lack three things that I want to have since I want a game where beef is about military:<br/>1) Different resources. Flanking specialization is really no different from assault specialization and commanders can be directly ordered by their efficiency, no matter the situation. Of course gm fiat can restrict these, but this was the very thing I wanted to get rid of..<br/>2) Rules for acquiring units ie. spending XP. Instead of GM fiat again.<br/>3) Flavour. Secret of sudden knife.. Does not really sound like what it does - minimum is to rename it to secret of Blitzkrieg!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
