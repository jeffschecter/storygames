The game has a rotating spotlight, and when it's your spotlight you go through a few phases of play: Committing a Crime (which is a narrative in which you succeed at your crime, whatever it is), Discovery Test (where we see whether the inspectors catch you), Conditioning Test (if they caught you, then we see whether they successfully brainwash you), Reflection Scene (a brief vignette where you return to your normal life - a "downbeat" where we see who you are when you're not in the heat of a crime).<br/><br/>Recently, I've started killing darlings pretty aggressively, in an attempt to bring the game closer to my new play preferences. The biggest darling at the moment is my game's setting, Cadence. It's a Victorian-Dystopia. When the saintly Queen Abigail died, parliament completely reworked society to better serve her memory - now everything functions automatically, in a static balance. Inspectors roam the streets, looking to enforce all the rigid social laws that guide people's lives. Love is all-but-illegal. You wear government issued grey. You are controlled. Well, they thought they had you controlled...<br/><br/>And this setting is fun to play in, for me. But there's this issue where I like creating settings through play, and I dislike relying on a central figure (a GM) to disseminate canon.<br/><br/>So I've got this idea. I can provide some central tenets for writing your own setting, a simple "style sheet" that you fill in before and through play to create your own world of Perfect. You can simply use Cadence (my completed style sheet), or you can make your own.<br/><br/>There are a few mandatory elements for a Perfect society: the law enforcers must be distant from criminals (external to society, faceless enforcers, other-than-human), the society must be big enough that there are strangers in a community, the enforcers must rely on psychological warfare (specifically, Conditioning sessions of some type), conditioning must leave criminals capable of committing future crimes. Other than that, it's fair game, so far.<br/><br/>So, I'm trying to figure out what's going to be on that style sheet.<br/>Right now, I'm thinking:<br/><br/>1.) In three words, this society is ___________, ___________, ___________.<br/>(blanks could be: steampunk, Victorian, futuristic, industrialized, modern, mostly rural, mostly urban, European, religious, capitalist...)<br/><br/>2.) It's like ______________ meets _______________.<br/>(blanks could be: Blade Runner, Clockwork Orange, 1984, Dexter, Handmaid's Tale, Fahrenheit 451, Equilibrium, A Scanner Darkly, Survivor, any genre fic...)<br/><br/>3.) The three <b>control axioms</b> are ______________, ______________, ________________.<br/>(blanks could be: Love is Vulgar, Colour is Banned, Women Are Weak, Violence Is Always Wrong, Marriage Is Assigned, Children Can't Choose, Immigrants Are Dangerous, Men Must Be Subjugated, Respect Your Elders...)<br/><br/>4a.) What kinds of social organizations exist? __________________________________<br/>(blank could include: professional, arts-related, political, religious cults, mandatory volunteer assemblies, celebrity fan clubs...)<br/>4b.) How are organizations controlled and regulated? _____________________________<br/>(blank could include: by government, by managerial body, by members, membership cards, initiation trials, mandatory membership for certain classes, self-declared membership...)<br/><br/>5a.) Who enforces law? _______________________________<br/>(blank could include: inspectors clad in black, heavily armed riot police)<br/>5b.) What technologies do they use to condition? _________________________<br/>(blank could include: dehumanization tactics, psychic projections, neural uploading, electroshock therapy, waterboarding, memory flushes, hypnosis, starvation, physical torture, media barrages, implanting microchips...)<br/><br/>The idea is that after this style sheet was created... on a given player's turn, they would choose an axiom that their crime conflicted with, create a law that their actions will break, and then narrate the vignette of breaking this law. Thus, through play a system of laws and customs would be established, with these laws always embodying some of the culture's guiding axioms of control and structure. You could break laws that'd been established in previous crimes, as well!<br/><br/>You'd also write specific organizations for your characters to be involved in, which reflected 4a and 4b. So if we were playing in Cadence, I might create the Lamplighter's Guild to be a part of, or create the Art Appreciator's Society (every character has 2 group memberships).<br/><br/><b>So, if you see issues (stuff missing, redundant elements, boring aspects, improvements), raise them.<br/>If you think this looks sound and compelling, fill in a style sheet for me!</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232876/#Comment_232876" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T14:22:23+00:00" title="September 17, 2009  2:22PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.)

I'd choose the "Sex Is For Humans" axiom and declare that there are laws prohibitting motorized sex toys - and I'd immediately launch into a story about smuggling a vibrator.<br/><br/>Or, perhaps, I'd focus on "Sub-Humans Are Inferior" and create a rule that you can't offer food to a mutant - and would launch into setting up an underground soup kitchen.<br/><br/>Rad.

Perfect is about harsh dystopias, and in this way ALL relevant societies will have "don't rock the boat". I see what you're getting at, especially in the context of everything else you've written, but as a free-standing statement this one doesn't fire for me. Whereas, "Tradition is Always Right" or "Tradition Is Paramount" would stand. Do you see the difference between those two categories?<br/><br/>How could I word advice to avoid "don't rock the boat"?

Pages 1-X are how-to-play, with running examples drawn from both Cadence and other settings.<br/>\nPages X-Y are style sheets (a page for The Confederacy of Sanguine, a page for Skinnyghost's setting, plus 3 more, FOR EXAMPLE).<br/>\nPages Y-Z would present Cadence - a style sheet plus 5-10 pages of images and additional background.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI the spirit of my $.02.  I would prefer:<br/>\n<br/>\nPages 1-X are how to play, with running examples drawn from Cadence (full stop, no mention of other settings).<br/>\nPages X-Y introduce the concept of style sheets and show how Cadence was drawn from / out of a style sheet.<br/>\nPages Y-Z are alternate style sheets with the instructions on how to create your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn otherwords lead completely, utterly and fully with Cadence (which IMO is too awesome a setting to relegate to just "one example among many" status).  THEN show people how to build their own "Cadence" by breaking Cadence down (reverse engineering a style sheet out of Cadence, if you will).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat worked really well in Penny for My Thoughts which holds to the central Amnesiacs in an Institution Setting throughout the book and then building out the options for alternate settings only at the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess to phrase this succinctly:  Style Sheets, Yes.  But don't dilute the power of Cadence in the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233002/#Comment_233002" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T10:03:50+00:00" title="September 18, 2009 10:03AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The society of Terra Alpha from the Doctor Who story <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Happiness_Patrol" rel="nofollow">The Happiness Patrol</a>, with some variations to fit into the structure:<br><br>1.)
