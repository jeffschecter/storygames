It focuses on ground-up design and design feedback. It's in its experimental stages, there's no real direction or advice or guidelines, but it's live and up. Think of it as Google Wave, but less cool and not as much hype.<br/><br/>To get there, click that tab on the top right called "To Praxis", and from Praxis click on the top right tab "To Story Games" to come back here.<br/><br/>The databases are different, but all users on Story Games since Monday October 26th are already active over there. You don't need to request a new account, just sign in with your S-G username and password. You can use your account settings to change your name, etc over there. The two accounts are no longer linked, so if you change your name or password here, it won't reflect over there, and vice-versa.<br/><br/>If you joined Story-Games from Tuesday October 27th onwards, then you will have to apply for membership over on Praxis if you want to join those discussions (because your user account won't automatically migrate over). In that "why do you want to join this site?" application text-box thingy, simply write something like, "Hey, my handle/name is XYZ over on story-games" and we'll quickly approve you.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're interested, poke around. Read the rules thread first; it's pretty much the same as here, but explains some of the features of the site.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252829/#Comment_252829" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T09:40:44+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  9:40AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dropping the sticky: Folks who wanted the design forum now have one.
