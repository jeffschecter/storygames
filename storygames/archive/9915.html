There's a thread over at the Forge that discusses it <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27617.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  The plan is to have panel discussion Friday Sept 4th at 10am and Saturday the 5th at 1pm.  If you're coming to the Con might be a good way to increase exposure and spread some education to people who haven't seen these sorts of games.  <br/><br/>The guy who's leading this goes by <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=3435" rel="nofollow">Certified</a> and has a developed a game called <a href="http://www.housedok.com/main.php" rel="nofollow">6th World</a>.  I'd drop him a line to get in on the ground floor.  <br/><br/>I hope to see some of you there!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220340/#Comment_220340" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T11:18:50+00:00" title="July 23, 2009 11:18AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and the deadline for getting a game registered at <a href="http://gaming.dragoncon.org/index.php" rel="nofollow">DragonCon</a> is July 30th so if you're coming and would like to run a game you may want to get it in soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
