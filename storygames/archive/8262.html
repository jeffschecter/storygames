Mind you, I've been waiting months to play this game and was stoked to bring it to the table. The players Karen and Chris P. played in a BW mini-campaign with me earlier this year, so we were all familiar with the game this was based on. And even though they hadn't read the comics, it's not too hard to get excited about "fricken mice with swords!!"<br/><br/>But unfortunately we ran smack into a wall of suck and it didn't end so well. Let me go into more detail.<br/><br/>First, we really enjoyed the character generation. The whole process feels more organic than the BW lifepath system. Instead, it's assumed that all the characters are on the same basic lifepath goal, which is to become a Mouse Guard. So the GM asks a series of questions and as the players answer them, their characters slowly take shape. As we were finishing up the character generation, we realized that we were coming up with some interesting answers to these questions that were simply turning into mechanical bits on the character sheet. So Karen and Chris P. went back to add some notes to the back of their character sheet to fill in some backstory on their characters. As the GM, I knew this would be useful for me in the future when I wanted to bring in aspects of their histories.<br/><br/>The last part of character generation was creating a belief, goal, instinct and gear. But to create a goal you need to have a mission in mind. So we needed to step back from character generation for awhile as I looked at the rules for mission generation and came up with one.<br/><br/>We talked about the seasons, and based on the rules it seems pretty natural that we would start in the Spring. THIS WAS A MISTAKE. None of us realized that the Nature rating of 6 for the Spring would mean frustration down the line for the characters. And there were no admonishments in the book about starting off in an easier season, especially if you are only playing with two characters.<br/><br/>So I wrote up a quick mission based on the following elements:<br/><br/>-Weather: flood<br/>-Wilderness: river<br/>-Animals: Otter, protecting her young<br/>-Mice: Ivy, a young mouse caught in the current<br/><br/>I led off with Weather and Wilderness as per the rules, and kept Animals and Mice in reserve for complications.<br/><br/>So Gwendolyn met with the two Guard Mice and told them how the thawing snow had created a river cutting off the Rustleaf and Frostic from the rest of the Mouse Territories. Nearby Port Sumac had enough trouble of its own to be supplying both towns over water.  So the Guard Mice were to travel to Port Sumac and find a way to reconnect the land bridge to Rustleaf.  Even though Gurney was a Guard Mouse and Sloan was a Patrol Guard (and usually patrols were led by a Patrol Leader), I noted that the spring thaw was creating such chaos that Gwendolyn had no choice but to send a less experienced mouse to led the patrol. And then they finished up their Beliefs, Goals, Instincts and Gear and they were off!<br/><br/><i>Karen made Sloan, an over-ambitious brown-noser who was the youngest Patrol Guard at 21. Belief: Refusing help will prove my self-sufficiency. Goal: I will demonstrate my leadership abilities to Gurney. Instinct: I accept all challenges and assignments. Traits: Tough, Natural Bearings.</i><br/><br/><i>Chris P. made Gurney, a bookish young mouse who was more of a sneak than a fighter. Belief: Even small Guard Mice can solve big problems. Goal: I will not rely on Sloan to get me out of trouble. Instinct: I never attack a problem head-on. Traits: Inquisitive, Calm.</i><br/><br/>As this was the "GM's turn", it was my job to describe the problem and how the characters were going to need to solve it. This felt a little too heavy-handed to me, so I simply told them that the winter had covered up most of the tracks to towns outside of the inner circle, so they could either make a Pathfinding roll to take the longer land route to Port Sumac, or a Boatcrafter roll to get to Port Sumac by water.<br/><br/>They decided the land route would be safer, and Karen rolled exactly the two successes they needed to get to Port Sumac with no complications.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181904/#Comment_181904" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-06T20:52:28+00:00" title="December  6, 2008  8:52PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [cont.]<br/><br/>And here's where the game fell apart for us. I described the river that had been created by the snow melting in the hills northwest of the area and was cutting right between the two towns. I wanted to see how they were going to fix this problem, and it seems like more than simply a single skill test. So we decided to use the full conflict rules. So those of you who have played BW/BE before, the conflicts are dealt with using a simplified version of Fight/Firefight/Duel-of-Wits. Both sides have a goal for the conflict, both sides roll for their beginning disposition, and they they script three actions at a time which are unveiled one by one, with mechanical rolls happening for each action.<br/><br/>The Mice Goal was "Build a bridge"<br/>The GM Goal was "Flood Port Sumac"<br/><br/>Mine didn't seem to harsh given what the characters were trying to accomplish was difficult. We decided that the conflict type was "Other". So they were rolled dice for starting disposition.<br/><br/>Karen rolled her Boatcrafter skill of 2, getting one success to add to her Nature of 4, giving them a disposition of 5.<br/>I rolled the Nature value for the Spring season of 6, getting three successes to add to the Nature of 6, giving me a disposition of 9.  Oops.<br/><br/>Now both sides scripted their first three actions. They knew things were going to be tough, so they scripted Defend-Defend-Attack. As I have done in other BW conflicts when I don't want to overwhelm the players, I thought I was taking it easy and scripted Attack, Defend, Maneuver. By the end of the first set of actions, the Mice disposition was down to 1 and I was still at 9, not having lost any. The Mice were basically screwed because they were rolling 2, 3, maybe 4 dice per action, and I was always rolling the Spring Nature of 6.<br/><br/>In the second set of actions, Karen did her point of Persona to tap her Nature and add 4 dice to her roll, but by then it was too late. They lost the conflict and only knocked two of my dice down. So I only had to give a minor concession to them. We discussed it and decided that due to their efforts the river changed course and started flooding Port Sumac, but that the Mice helped to get the townsmice to higher ground and no one was seriously harmed.<br/><br/>But I could see the player frustration while the conflict was going on. They totally felt like the deck was stacked against them when I was rolling all sixes and their relevant skills for the conflict were twos. The character creation talked about "well-rounded Guard Mice" and they didn't see any necessity in making specialized characters until this point. And they hated getting trapped into the three action choices they had made without being able to change them when the circumstances changed. <br/><br/>So by the end of the conflict, the players weren't really in the mood to continue the mission and neither was I. We've persevered through worse, so we will probably play again, with several important changes:<br/><br/><b>1. We will play in the Summer season, where the GM gets a lower Nature of 4. Hopefully they will be able to increase some skills before Fall hits, but I think that's unlikely given how few missions there are in each season and how many chances you actually get to attempt rolls on each mission.<br/>2. I will let the characters redistribute some of their skill points to bulk up important skills. This will make them less well-rounded, but I can't see a way around this.<br/>3. We are scrapping the "pick three actions at once" and just picking our actions in a conflict one at a time, secretly. I usually don't like to drift core rules in Luke's games, but this one is a no-brainer for us and I think will make our conflicts more satisfying and less frustrating</b>.<br/><br/>The rules of MG definitely seem to be geared towards having more than two characters and/or having more experienced characters. Rolling three and four dice when the GM rolls six or seven is just not fun. We ran into this in BW and it was frustrating then as well.<br/><br/>In the past when I have posted notes from a less-than-stellar AP session, people on this board tend to walk away and not comment on it. Which I think it weak sauce. So I hope that people will jump in here to discuss. What are your thoughts? Good or bad, let's hear them!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181908/#Comment_181908" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-06T22:16:52+00:00" title="December  6, 2008 10:16PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2008 10:17PM by noclue.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, still reading the game, but I'll venture some thoughts with the proviso that anyone can feel free to shoot them full of holes like swiss cheese:<br/><br/>1. I don't see any teamwork from the Guardsmice in your post. Lone, inexperienced guardsmouse v. raging river of certain death doesn't look like good odds to me. Did Chris help with the disposition roll? Did they switch of actions and assisting using their strengths?<br/><br/>2. Her boatcrafter skill is 2??? My burning-wheel-wise is screaming "Ouch. That's gonna hurt!" Failure was likely from the onset of the conflict and should have been planned on. Which leads me to:<br/><br/>3. What's so bad about failure in this context? You lost two dice, so you have to give a concession. And is there nothing in MG that let's failure drive the plot forward. Like maybe Sumac is flooded so the Guardsmice have a new mission, like Save the food stores so the survivors can rebuild, or save some poor drowning mouse before she's swept away in the raging torrent (wait a sec...don't I remember something about a little wet mouse named Ivy?)<br/><br/>Anyway, those are my thoughts: Teamwork. Expect failure with low dice. Make failure fun. Someone tell me where I'm going wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181912/#Comment_181912" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-06T23:41:20+00:00" title="December  6, 2008 11:41PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The common factor I always seem to see when first-time Burning Wheel games go wrong is that people never follow the basic training advice- in the case of BW it's the recommendation that you take time with the basic conflict rules before doing all the nitty gritty rules, and for MG I was wondering how many gamers would skip over the advice that you use the pregen characters and missions for the first few times playing.<br/><br/>BW games require a level of understanding on the part of the players about how the system works- you cannot jump in without an understanding of the system and expect to use the rules to make a good story (anymore than Capes, Grey Ranks, Polaris, etc.)<br/><br/>I look at BW games especially as being something where the first 1-3 sessions are system training as well as play:<br/><br/>1) What are the odds of success/failure? (1/2 your dice will probably succeed.  Seems obvious, but based on reading lots of reports, apparently it isn't.)<br/><br/>2) How do you get more dice? (What are your options? Help, Teamwork, Wises, here.  Fate, Persona, Traits.)<br/><br/>3) How do you play off your BITs to get rewards, and shape the story? How do you shape your BITs as you play to continue that?<br/><br/>Though this helps the players figure what they're doing, it also helps you, the GM figure out what kind of things they can and can't handle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181913/#Comment_181913" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-06T23:43:07+00:00" title="December  6, 2008 11:43PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoyed the game, especially the "mouse burning."<br/><br/>* As CB said, I wish there was a character creation worksheet like BW. It would help walking through all the mouse questions, plus the completed worksheet would be an aid role-playing for the character and a "player flags" for the GM.<br/><br/>* We ended up with "well rounded" mice, partly because the sequence of lifepath-like character creation questions encouraged (us, at least) to choose a variety of unrelated skills. A mouse's parents, artisan, and mentor would probably not have overlapping skills to contribute. So I guess we should have used our 6-8 skill points to pump up the skills from our mice's backgrounds.<br/><br/>* I did not help in the Disposition roll because we believed the "lead mouse" was responsible. But I would have only been able to contribute 1 helping die (for an average of +0.5 Disposition points).<br/><br/>* Karen and I both felt that that preselecting three Actions for a Conflict was just blind guessing. There must be some deep strategy for experienced players that know their opponents skill rankings and can compute some probabilities. But to us it felt like playing Paper-Rock-Scissors because we could not react in Actions 2 and 3 to the results of Actions 1 and 2, respectively.<br/><br/>* I have not (yet) read the Mouse Guard book, but do mice supposed to play seasons sequentially? As CB pointed out, the season's dispositions do not increase in a way that would align with mice advancing their skills (esp.

That's not what's going on in this game. It's possible to overcome, but you must be diligent and lucky. Even two guardmice can be bested by the weather. That said, Seasons conflicts are rare. <br/><br/>3) The I Am Wise rules are easy to use and often provide bonus dice <br/><br/>4) Traits are another source of bonus dice.<br/><br/>5) Nature is incredibly useful and must be tapped in order to rise above your mouseness and actually beat the environment.<br/><br/>6) Failure isn't failure in Mouse Guard.

Two inexperienced mice try to stop a raging flood by themselves and they fail (of course), but they manage to save lives against all odds! What a wonderful opening sequence. I can picture the panel with the guard mice standing on a hilltop with the wet survivors, looking down on the rooftops of Port Sumac poking up through the water.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to hear it was a frustrating experience. From my armchair, I'm seeing a big disconnect between the player's expectations and the reality of the game and system. To me, that conflict played out perfectly and gave you great material to work with. But if the players expected to go up against the toughest opposition in the game and win on their first try, without good tactics and no teamwork... well... like Luke said, that's not what's going on in this game.<br/><br/>I don't see anything in the book that suggests that newly-made guard mice are superheroes who stop raging floods without a lot of help. The message I'm getting from the book is the exact opposite. Mice are small and vulnerable against the big, cruel world. When they succeed, it's due to perseverance, teamwork, using their mousy Natures, and luck.<br/><br/>Having said that, the mice could have done better in the conflict if the players had used all their resources. With Nature, teamwork dice, wises, and traits, the mice could have been rolling <i>more</i> dice than the Season. It's still far from a sure thing, but with some luck they might have pulled it out (leaving them a bit resource poor, but hey... they would have stopped a flood).<br/><br/>Finally, as Luke said, failure isn't failure in MG.

Hopefully this thread will help you and your players to see that you did it just right and created big drama for your mice. Sounds to me that the games does exactly what it should to help create great MG stories. Of course, if the players are not really into these kind of stories, you have a problem and the game is perhaps not the right for you, but to be honest I can't imagine why not. It's, as John said, perhaps just a case of wrong expectations. The next time you'll be fine, now you know what you're up against!<br/><br/>I would strongly advice not drifting the conflict rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181943/#Comment_181943" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T09:29:12+00:00" title="December  7, 2008  9:29AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game does suggest starting in Spring, though it is group's call (page 56).

I'd have been all like...two young guardsmice against a raging river flood?  We are SOOOO going to fail this...lets burn every resource and use every trick in the book to get at least some concession so we can save as much of the town and the mice as we can.  Then the next mission is set by the players...so that's just tailor made for something like: leading a group a refugees to safety.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther folks have already given lots of tips.  Its hard to tell from the details, but it sounds like your players didn't use any tactics at all...but maybe you just didn't mention it.  I mean, they saw your disposition of 9 to their 5...they saw you were rolling 6 dice...and they didn't tap their nature until the second round?  Given it was your first session, you maybe could have done a better job of reminding them of the rule options and pointing out the opportunities for using them...but geeze, what did they expect?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here's another idea.  If you're going to throw a big nasty encounter at the characters right out of the gate, just make it a complex obstacle instead of a conflict.  That way the Twist / Condition mechanics give you full power over success and failure.  Failure on one of the lead up tests could have lead to the encounter with the Otter (and the mice can escape by double tapping Nature pretty easily), Failure on another could have led to the rescue of Ivy...and Failure on the final Test could have been fiated as success with Conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that would have enabled you to play out the scene much more smoothly and give you more control over how badly the mice get trounced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181958/#Comment_181958" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T11:07:12+00:00" title="December  7, 2008 11:07AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is making me jones to play this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181960/#Comment_181960" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T11:12:51+00:00" title="December  7, 2008 11:12AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fear of failure is the new brain damage.<br><br>p.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181966/#Comment_181966" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T11:22:42+00:00" title="December  7, 2008 11:22AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno if I want to touch the brain damage thing... but there is something that could be going on with precedent here. <br><br>Like, there are a lot of games out there that are basically mission completion games. The point of those games is to use your resources well in order to successfully complete a mission. In those games failing the mission is failing. It isn't game destroying, but it is a failure. You had a chance to step on up, and you didn't step, as it were. <br><br>Mouse Guard looks a lot like a mission completion games. Mouse Guard feels a lot like a mission completion game. But I don't think Mouse Guard actually is a mission completion game. Mouse Guard is a game where you tell a story about mice who go on a mission. That's a close thing, but its also a sharp and important divide. <br><br/>If you're playing MG as a mission completion game, then failing to stop the river is frustrating and annoying, and feels like a player failure because (in some ways at least) it is a player failure. If, otoh, you're playing MG as a story game about mice on a mission, then you get the exact response both Ralph and John gave -- "Yay, the small mice lost against the big cruel world, but at least we saved the other mice!" <br/><br/>It's a paradigm thing, as much as anything. <br/><br/>P.S.

Which is why I did preface my statement with "So maybe I'm out of line here..."<br/>\n<br/>\nI read the Fall hardback Mouseguard book and enjoyed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew somebody that had Burning Wheel and I thumbed the book. Definitely not the sort of game I was looking for. Burning Empires came out and I was intrigued and checked out the book and from what I saw, not much had changed.<br/>\n<br/>\n*shrug*<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't see those two games being advertised as being for "intended for all ages and levels of game-playing experience", which is what Mouseguard seems to be claiming. I poked into this thread because it sounded like I'd have a chance to get a feel for what (if anything) was different with Mouseguard's version of the rules. I already listened to the podcast interview with Luke talking about how much simpler these rules were, as well as seeing a number of other Burning X fans talking about how much simpler the rules were.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not dropping $50 on a game I don't know if I'm going to like in the first place. It's not like there's a shortage of games to run and play out there, so I don't have a burning need to pick this one up. But I liked the Mouseguard book and thought "This sounds like it might be the game that'll actually work for me. People are always going on about how awesome Burning Wheel is. Maybe this is the version to hit some of the stuff I want from an rpg."<br/>\n<br/>\nMy response above is in part because of these bits:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">BW games require a level of understanding on the part of the players about how the system works- you cannot jump in without an understanding of the system and expect to use the rules to make a good story (anymore than Capes, Grey Ranks, Polaris, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI look at BW games especially as being something where the first 1-3 sessions are system training as well as play:</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Per%20Fischer">Per Fischer</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">Hopefully this thread will help you and your players to see that you did it just right and created big drama for your mice.

It's done a great job of telling me "this game is not for you. It caters to people that want to work at playing it." That's fine and all if you're into it, but it should go without saying that not everyone is going to be into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also kinda bugs me a bit because there seems to be some overtones of "You're doing it wrong!" Maybe I'm just overly sensitized to that sort of thing, having seen it in the past whenever Burning X games get brought up it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be hard to believe, but the number of _grown_ people that are into playing mice? Not so many. An informal poll of the 7 gamers I know yielded absolutely none interested in it. Except my wife, who's still relatively new to playing rpgs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the target market for this game is really "experienced gamers", then groovy. But someone that's new to the game or new to rpgs? I gotta say, reading those snippets that I quoted doesn't exactly do a great job at saying, "This game is for you".<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, some people new to rpgs might be into the whole "failure is cool thing", but all the people I've ever known that were new to gaming were much more into the "wish fulfillment" stage that apparently is so wrong to approach this game with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case this reads like I'm pissed or upset... I'm not. I'm vaguely disappointed, because I really wanted to get this game and be into it. I'll note that I'm probably not the only person out there curious about the game, so to an extent this thread (and others like it) are going to be how some folks make the decision as to whether to get the book or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182127/#Comment_182127" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T10:26:47+00:00" title="December  8, 2008 10:26AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eh...except all those quotes, except the first one, don't talk about work but about expectations, especially trad. gamer expectations.

QUIT USING THE WORD "FAILURE". The book doesn't use it. You're mapping a mechanic from other games onto this game, which is patently unfair. Next thing you know, people will be bitching that guardmice <i>ACs</i> are unbalanced, or that they don't have enough <i>aspects</i>.<br><br>In Mouse Guard, you either succeed without complication, or you experience a twist en route to eventual success, or you receive a condition as a cost of success. <i>Those are the only possible outcomes of any versus test in the game</i>. That's it. Full stop. IIRC the only way to truly and totally cock up your intent in MG is to lose at a scripted conflict without compromise. <br><br>Also re "brain damage": I was mostly being provocative but, in the words of Al Franken, I was also "kidding on the square". Kidding, but not really. If you read "I didn't succeed at my intent" as "I was unable to affect the story successfully and heroically," there's something else going on.<br><br>Listening to gamers who react violently against complications to their empowerment fantasies is like watching people walk around with shrapnel sticking out of their heads. &lt;&lt;-- me being provocative again, see?<br><br/>p.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182434/#Comment_182434" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T13:04:32+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  1:04PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that there's too often a black and white dichotomy between success and failure in many rpgs, but as for scripting - I can't think of anything more diametrically opposed to a storytelling game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Mouse Guard] Tough first session - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8262/mouse-guard-tough-first-session/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[Mouse Guard] Tough first session - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8262/mouse-guard-tough-first-session/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Come again?

Something you don't find fun...ok.<br/>\nBut opposed to story telling?  That does not compute.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I found the scripting in Mouse Guard to really enhance the story telling of the fight scene.  Scripting a Feint against an enemy attack is great fodder for colorful description and vows of vengeance.  In fact, other than my own Blood Red Sands, I've yet to see a combat system that makes me as a player more motivated to get revenge on some NPC who beat me...just because they beat me and I want to erase the humiliation...than scripting.  That's some ripe story telling fruit right there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've found the shear number of options in BW to be a bit intimidating (MG is much more streamlined) but anti story-telling?  I can't even comprehend that comment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182440/#Comment_182440" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T13:20:14+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  1:20PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, that's just total lala-land.

That's failure in the normal everyday walking around talking sense of the word "failure."  It may be a good or a bad thing for a game or a story or a story game but let's not pretend it isn't what it clearly is.  Come on now. There's failure in this game. The original poster experienced it.<br/><br/>I don't know where all the sidewise in this thread came from, I kinda thought all the suggestions were good, especially the observation that the mission identified by the group and introduced in the fiction is not in fact the point of the game. That's a huge distinction that can easily be missed, especially since most other games that are organized by mission (Spycraft, MURPG, etc.) explicitly give you rewards for beating the mission and sometimes even punish you for not beating it, and their missions may or may not be linked - by contrast, from what I'm reading here, in MG, they are required to be linked. Are they required to be a response to the outcome of the previous mission or is the link permitted to be more tenuous? (Am I getting the right impression from the thread?)<br/><br/>The little heroic miceys standing on the roofs of their flooded homes, that's such a great image, I want to dive right into the next mission right away! And that is a big emotional difference from "well Mr. Bond, goldfinger ripped off fort knox because you and your team flubbed it, oh well, your next mission is to fight Dr. No". One is up, the other is down. You should feel bad if you let Goldfinger rip off Fort Knox! You lost! The end! But if it's not the end, if it's a loss in a string of challenges, that's different - like in With Great Power, where you have to lose 5 times before you can defeat the villain's plans. 5 times - you can win Over 9,000 times but your victories will never ever put the villain's dastardly plan  for world domination in jeopardy until you lose 5 times. It makes the losses more sweet, even though they're painful. "Arrgh, the bank was robbed and my girlfriend betty jo is now betty bee the stinging insect-girl of the destructulons!" <br/><br/>That's not to say that previous mission-based games don't have advantages. Self-containment makes it easy on everyone to keep characters on the same page, introduce new characters and get rid of old ones, etc.<br/><br/>Anyhow, stop fooling around, there was good stuff here.<br/><br/>*arms crossed defiantly*<br/><br/>Edit: And a JDCorley wall of text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MattJohnston" title="MattJohnston"><img alt="MattJohnston" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cimota.com/slypic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MattJohnston">MattJohnston</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183286/#Comment_183286" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-14T02:57:57+00:00" title="December 14, 2008  2:57AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">@Caesar_X</a> - Actually your rendition of the game seems to have made me want to BUY this game so I hope you hit the creators for a commission.<br/><br/>My take on the "Failure" thing hinges on the thought that "any landing you can walk away from is a good one". It certainly reminds me of Watership Down with their bittersweet victories - they seem to go from adversity to adversity...<br/><br/>I'd never get my players to play it - in two and a half years we've played Delta Green, Cthulhu by Gaslight and RuneQuest (and is leading me to get them to play Jorune by converting it to BRP).
