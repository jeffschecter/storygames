                    "Are you here for orientation?"<br/><br/>Of the games I was running at the small con, Lacuna was giving me the most troubles.  Not because of the game system, but because I wanted the entire thing to be immersive and I didn't know how well I could do that in a large gaming hall in the mid-afternoon on a sunny weekend.  [Actual Play tip for Lacuna #1:  Because of the dream logic flowing and surreal encounters inside Blue City, play the game at night, indoors, with your windows uncovered.  The subtle psychological effect of the night will affect the players.]<br/><br/>So the start of the game:  I enter as Senior Agent Graves.  "Congratulations on your promotion to Blue level.  This is Blue level Orientation.  Before we begin, let me call the roll."  Each player had a dossier containing their new Blue identification badge, personnel record, the HP's FBI identification card, the arrest report of the HP, the coroner reports of his three (known) victims, and a multi-page after-action report.  In a playtest of the con scenario, my gaming group suggested handouts so they didn't have to scribble down things like the name of the HP and his likely haunts in Blue City.  Having the handouts worked extremely well from my point of view.  <br/><br/>The first half-hour was spent describing the game mechanics.  In character, the orientation session was a simulation of an actual dive.  "Vice-Director Sorensen has created a method to simulate a dive into Blue City," and the dive was a recreation of an earlier dive.  By adding that last bit in, we can marry that with the fiction in the Lacuna book where it implies that all Agents are reformed HPs to make one of the PCs the HP they're hunting down.  (The HP, Jason Luster, killed all his victims by strangulation.  Jason Corley, playing Agent Bailey, requisitioned a garrote from Control, making this linkage a lot easier.) <br/><br/>Jason commented how well this Agent as HP worked in the game.  In order to find the HP, the Agents had to go to locations where the HP feels at home and find potential targets of the HP in Blue City.  They would be doing exactly what the HP would be doing.<br/><br/>Static works great in the game.  In the playtest and the con scenario, we got up to 18 static but by that time, we were indoors.  [AP tip #2:  If you're using a static chart, have higher static numbers not be dependent on inside/outside locations.]  In addition to the standard static causing events, I also included things like "if the Agent has to sharpen his pencil".  I was a bit disappointed to see that two of the four players had mechanical pencils.  (Should've had them clear the table when we started, making them use my crappy Number 2s.)<br/><br/>At the endgame, we had all four agents trapped behind the mirrors in the funhouse as Luster approached his recurring Blue City victim.  Agent Fowler wanted to see if he could get a psychic fix on Luster's location.  The Intuition roll was barely a success, and yes, he could feel that Luster within a few feet of him.  Fowler stated he'd turn and tackle Luster.  The Takedown roll was a success (we renamed Strategy to Takedown based on feedback from the playtest), and Fowler tackled Bailey.  The HP was released into a flowing mass of roaches, the third time roaches appeared in the City.  Lacuna, eject.<br/><br/>After the description of the worried medical staff standing over Bailey and... Carver(?), we ended the simulation and took out the after-action reports.  Most of them had three pages, some had four pages.  As the form went on, the questions became stranger and more accusatory in tone. ("If at if at any time you were told to describe something that did or did not happen, how did you respond if you responded by describing something that happened if it if did not or did happen or not in this after action report?")  The form also became harder to read, like the later pages in the Lacuna book.  While the Agents began filling out the lengthy paperwork, I excused myself to head to the restroom.<br/><br/>I never came back.                </div>

I know I'm not amongst the initiated when it comes to Sorensen's games, but even if it fit with the scenario don't you think that might sour someone's response to a game or prevent them from asking questions, giving feedback, or just saying, "Hell yeah!"?<br/><br/>Or did the players agree for a full-on experience and know to track you down later?                        </div>

                            The revised Lacuna personnel sheet I mentioned at The Forge is available at <a href="http://gameworld.thesnakefarm.com/downloads/lacuna_personnel_sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">this link</a> .  The most awesome flyers advertising the game session are at <a href="http://gameworld.thesnakefarm.com/downloads/lacuna_flyers.pdf" rel="nofollow">this other link</a> .<br/><br/>During the con scenario, I had a folder on the table right in front of me.  It was never referenced or opened during the scenario.  After I left, it remained, the only thing at the table.  In it was this memo, one copy for each player which you can get by <a href="http://gameworld.thesnakefarm.com/downloads/endgame.pdf" rel="nofollow">following this link right here</a>.                        </div>

                            In truth, I did come back after about twenty-five minutes.  I had a mole in the gaming hall to call me once the players had opened the folder mentioned above; the players had continued to play, in character, for about fifteen to twenty minutes after I left the gaming hall.  When I got back, they all said they thought it was hilarious.  We talked about it (and other game stuff) for about an hour.                        </div>

                            Great summary, Thomas. It really did play well.  The BPM mechanic is highly impressive as a pacing mechanic, in that it not only has a clear 'first this, then this' progression, but it also has a natural arc towards an endpoint.<br/>
<br/>
One way you can subvert the atmosphere at a con is to complain (as you did) about the location in-character.  You could have played that up a little more. I know I just cackled inside when you said "I am sorry we could not obtain a conference room for this orientation and had to use this..." (disdainfully) "...lunchroom."                        </div>
