                    Seeing the awesome-o-fied threads makes me wonder:  What is it that makes a setting awesome?  (As an optional primer, back at the Forge, there's a <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=13827.0" rel="nofollow">great thread about the components of setting</a>.)<br/><br/>I would like to talk about both categories of awesome, with specific examples if you have favorites.<br/><br/>My initial thoughts are going in the direction of conflicts in which the characters can participate and cool details that provide a consistent atmosphere, but I'm much more interested in what other people think before I go into that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  So:  what are your favorite settings?  Favorite parts of settings?  And most importantly, why?  And how did they make your games awesome?                </div>

                            My favorite setting was an electropunk Edwardian game my group collaboratively created, complete with Martian blood parasites, Teutonic villains, and heat-ray-equipped aeroplanes.  It was awesome because we made it together and poured a lot of love into the characters and setting, fuelled by obsessive historical research.  We introduced real-world NPCs, changed by the alternate history we'd invented - Jim Thorpe, Chester Nimitz, Teddy Roosevelt, and others made appearances.  Nobody could have predicted the places that campaign went, because we all had a hand in creating and running it.  One of my greatest joys was introducing improbable and pulpy NPCs (Ota Benga!) and objects (The Pemberton-Billing Nighthawk!) that were, in fact, totally real.                        </div>

                            Well, I think an awesome setting is one that offers things that players can tie their goals, beliefs, keys or whatever to in order to drive a campaign.  It all really boils down to a setting that players can be invested in.  I'm not sure there is any one component you could point to (of course, there is the age old Ninjas vs. Pirates debate).                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>So:  what are your favorite settings?</blockquote>
AlQadim: Why: I only played it a scant few times, but it went to a place (middle eastern culture) where no other game went to that scale. Nowadays I couldn't se myself diving into a game without some reworking, but for the time it's good stuff.<br/><br/>Dark Sun: It put moral choices and real solid "good vs evil; life vs death" into EVERY adventure, whether you just wanted to dungeon crawl or not. Also, when The Veiled Alliance came out, I realized that the lands in DS were analogues for real ancient cultures and cities, and I love playing in that kind of environment.<br/>Bizarre, because I originally bought DS, read it, thought "It's a setting for power-hungry gaming twinks", and gave it to my friend. Later, when I saw the Veiled Alliance supplement, I did a total 180 and at one time bought or had all the supplements to this game. BTW, when we say Dark Sun I think we all know I mean the original and not the played-out POS that was the "revised edition" (where you basically play a minor PC living in the shadows of the DS novel author's Pet PCs).<br/><br/>I didn't get too far into Earthdawn, but I liked a lot of the internal logic and flavor.<br/><br/>TRIBE 8: THe core book, while a strained read, set up one of the darkest imaginable post-apoc worlds.  It was real world post-apoc, and it felt like Dark Sun with less magic and more Native American mythology and magic. It was nearly murdered for me by the rolling splat supplements, though.<br/><br/>PLANESCAPE: Go Anywhere. Do Anything. Seriously. THe only limits were the shitty AD&amp;D2E rules.
<blockquote>And how did they make your games awesome?</blockquote>
I only played Earthdawn and Tribe 8 a few times, didn't run them.<br/><br/>Planescape: Every session we would adventure in a totally new and unique place. Kept player interest extreme.<br/><br/>Dark Sun: The savagery of the setting and the power levels involved kept folks interested in being cool, doing cool things, and still meeting challenges from fights, social conflicts, the world itself, etc.<br/><br/>Al Qadim: The mystique of the setting was fan to wear.<br/><br/>Aside from the above established settings, I've had VERY mixed success with game worlds I made myself, most "average" or "the players didn't notice or care about the setting really". The times where the players all got together and developed the world as a group, the setting has been rich and interesting for everyone in the game. So I think that says a lot in there, too.<br/><br/><b>ALSO</b>, I have a sub-question for folks: What needs to eventually get put into the Awesome-O-Tron here? I'm thinking of spacing them out about 10-14 days each for Max Awesomosity.<br/><br/>My List:<br/>Al-Qadim<br/>Dark Sun<br/>Tribe 8<br/>Earthdawn<br/><br/>What else needs The Treatment?                        </div>

                            Oh, I forgot to add non-fantasy games.<br/><br/>Favorite setting for a game I never played (but am mining it for my ongoing PTA game): Continuum.  It's loaded, it's interesting, it's mysterious, it's fucking TIGHT. The gamerules I still say are pretty unplayable as-is, and the internal logic to the game falls apart once you realize whoever says something First pretty much defines the reality of the game.<br/><br/>Favorite Supers Setting: ABERRANT. I don't like the rules, really. But I love the background. It's the most interesting, down-to-earth, socially aware game setting for a supers game I think that we'll ever see. It's internally consistent, explains a lot of supers conventions, has a common point of origins for all heroes, and most of all again it basically has the supers deal with modern issus like poverty, prejudice, wealth, fame and the like. It's not always fighting dudes in weird-science armor...                        </div>

                            What really blew me away about Dark Sun back in the day was that it was an RPG setting with a clear ecological message.  It was after reading that setting that I realized RPG's could be about something important.<br/><br/>And I struggled to figure out what to do with it and just couldn't do it.  I remember being unable to daydream in the Dark Sun world.<br/><br/>Other settings in need of Awesome-O-Tron spins?<br/><br/>Rifts                        </div>

                            A cool setting <br/>
<br/>
Shadowrun. I love this setting to death. Own most of the 3rd ed books for it. (I have serious problems with the rules system but thats another topic) <br/>
<br/>
Why do I love it. <br/>
<br/>
Lots of reasons <br/>
<br/>
1. Its cheezy and makes me laugh, nothings funnier than an elf with a mullet. <br/>
<br/>
2. Its 2 cool concepts thrown together, Cyberpunk and Tolkien. I like lasersharking, what can i say. <br/>
<br/>
3. Cool NPC's that somehow manage to not overshadow my character in any way I care about. Harlequin and Deus and Dunkelzahn are cool. I especially love when they are mentioned in passing as part of an adventure but arent actually in it. <br/>
<br/>
4. Lots of room, I feel like I can run all kinds of stuff in the shadowrun-verse and still have it be engaging, I have seriously considered running a game where everyone plays WageSlaves who occasionally get to be Mr. Johnson's . <br/>
<br/>
5. Relatively focused goal built into the game. You are all criminals, thats the reason you know eachother...GO!. I hate when im a druid and this other guys a thief, and then theres the paladin, and theres no logical reason we even know eachother, much less associate on a constant basis. I like that focus built into the setting. <br/>
<br/>
6. Broad details that cement the world in my imagination yet dont get in my way creatively. Now shadowrun breaks this rule sometimes, but most of the time they got it right. Aztechnology owns mexico, they are into blood magic, they are agressive about expanding there business empire but compared to the other corps they are small potatoes outside mexico. This is enough detail that I dont have to explain what aztechnology is to everyone everytime they get used, but its also little enough detail that I can tweak it to my needs on the fly. <br/>
<br/>
7. And this one mostly goes for pre-3rd as they started getting away from this. but...its fun to read outside of gaming. I honestly enjoy flipping thru the rulebooks and reading all the wierd little details that the people at FASA made up. Its cool stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Thanx<br/>

Ota Benga rawked!  I have always wanted to play that character.  What I really liked about him was how wiley and worldly he could be while maintaining a "fascade" of the aboriginal.                        </div>

                            I find the Rifts setting pretty awesome. (hangs head in shame)<br/><br/>Good Stuff:<br/>The kitchen sink nature of the game gives you a lot of material to work with.  All you have to do is narrow your focus a bit.<br/>The buildup to war between Tolkien and the CS gives you a nice pre-war tension to play on.<br/>Cyber-Knights and idealistic Coalition Officers are great characters to plunge into moral dilemmas. They're even better when you pit them against each other.<br/>Lasersharking!<br/><br/>Bad Stuff:<br/>The Rules

                            Gosh, settings:<br/><br/>Settings I love and why:<br/><b>Tribe 8</b> (Dream Pod 9) - It's got it all.  Spirituality. Grounded human drama.  Story and drive that stem from cultural conflicts on all levels and a supernatural ambiguity that speaks to the mystery that is the human soul.  Tattoos, crazy weapons and artifacts of the past (read modern earth) used as various tools - this game delivers one of the deepest rp experiences of my gaming career.<br/><br/><b>Gemini </b>(Cell Entertainment) - This is, by far, my favorite fantasy setting.  Deep religious overtones, a dark and brooding world with overpowering political conflicts.  Elves and dwarves have flavor and meaning.  It solidifies the genre while, at the same time turns it on it's ear.  Include horrific overtones and I'd run this campaign for the rest of my life if I wasn't so ADD.<br/><br/>Any Western Game (Deadlands/Dogs in the Vineyard/Serenity/Boot Hill) - I am a sucker for westerns.  This genre just opens up to me.  It's visceral and gritty while maintaining some mystery and modernity to it.  It allows for guns and duels while still feeding off melee traditions.  Specifically I also like applying real world with the fantastic.  Magic must be involved in nearly everything I run and this is a great setting to include creepiness, shamanism and hermetic lodges.  By the way if you ever get to read a manga called <b>Priest</b> you'll understand what I mean <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So if I were to think about it ,much of that decision making is very, very subjective.  Certain genres and genre mixes are very evocative for me.  I like toned down magic and a means to explore the human condition.  Something has to "feel" real for it to get my attention.                        </div>

                            All settings rock.<br/><br/>It takes so little to get somebody interested in a setting. Al Quadim, for instance, was so badly realized as a setting by the D&amp;D rules, that it's amazing that Andy fell for it. But, I did too. Why? Because when you see the arabic-esque font, it makes you want to play out something like those old Sinbad movies you used to catch on the local station in the afternoon after school. <br/><br/>I mean, the font is about all there is to Al Quadim. That and the idea that it's somehow "Persian" or "Arabian Nights" or something. Who wouldn't want to play that? <br/><br/>Let's try this, name a setting that you think is non-awesome. I can't do it. They're all awesome. Just the idea of some world with...features...out there to explore. Doesn't really matter what it is. I mean, even if it's our world...our world is fun to explore. Even if the setting is: <br/><br/>Nowhere World - a completely featureless place where all that can be percieved is a non-threatening white light that illuminates the only things that exist, the PCs. <br/><br/>Damn, now I want to play in Nowhere World, too.<br/><br/>Settings just aren't the interesting thing about RPGs. It's what you're going to do in them that's interesting. And, given even the slightest imagination, you get all sorts of ideas in any setting. Making all settings awesome.<br/><br/>So my suggestion? Just pick one. And then pick a system that's going to bring the setting to life. Now that's the awesomest setting of all. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            Thanks for the responses!  I've already learned a couple of interesting things.<br/><br/>Mike: Yes, many settings have the potential to be awesome.  But why are there awesome-o-fy threads?  People are making the settings more awesome.  That means there are some things that are just clicking more with some people than others.<br/><br/>I can name some settings that I think are rather blah.  The setting of Das Schwarze Auge, as of the Second Edition, really was rather dull.  The creators actually announced that they would implement lots of changes to make the whole place more interesting, because there just wasn't much conflict going on in the setting, not many aspects that could create interesting situations for the characters.<br/><br/>It sounds like you're saying, "Setting Doesn't Matter," which just doesn't ring true to me at all.  Sure, some players can make cool situations out of everything.  But then, some players can have consistent fun no matter what System they use.  That doesn't mean that System Doesn't Matter, just that it matters less for some people than others.<br/><br/>Cf. KULT.  The setting as a fictional creation is great.  But the potential to use the setting for situations with the character types presented is rather weak.  Or else, the presentation of HOW to use the setting for situation creation is weak.                        </div>

Yeah, I think it's what you put INTO them that really matters... the more passion you put into it, the more people are going to respond to it... which is why everything in the Awesome threads is so cool.                        </div>

That's the truth!  I must say that Ravenloft always got my creative juices flowing as well.  I think those two are pretty popular when it comes to conversions, since the setting was such a development beyond the rules-set being worked with.                        </div>

<em>In terms of play,</em><br/>Setting is a tool to create situation.  Period.  Setting is only useful insomuch as it provides, guides, and inspires the players to create compelling and entertaining situations juxtaposing characters in conflicts.  If it doesn't do this, it utterly fails the very reason for its existence in regards to play.<br/><br/><em>In terms of reading sourcebooks outside of play,</em><br/>Setting is a rich and detailed situation (contrast already-a-situation with tool-to-create-situation) with colorful characters, multiple sides, and many potential resolutions.  It suggests more than it explains and leads the reader to flights of fancy and imagination.<br/><br/>There's a large portion of the hobby that really enjoys setting in the second sense and mistakes their flights of fancy in reading it with the experience of using the setting in the first sense.  I don't so much take umbrage at the folks who like reading sourcebooks (I like a well-written sourcebook time to time), but the inability to distinguish between <em>playing</em> a game and <em>imagining what it might like to be in the setting</em> kind of drives me up a wall.<br/><br/>So I like <em>Tribe 8</em> as a setting since it's a simple simple matter to create situations with concrete, specific characters and interests that can appear in the ensuing game.  Contrast that with, say, <em>Exalted</em>, which gives very little help in actually generating the situation that the players will involve themselves in.  Or compare <em>Dogs</em>, even if you consider it without Town Creation, with something like <em>Deadlands</em>.  You read the setting bits of <em>Dogs</em> and you know exactly what a game will be like; you read the setting bits of <em>Deadlands</em> and you're left going, "Wow, that's a neat world.  Now I should think of something wholecloth that could conceivably fit in one corner of it."                        </div>

I agree 100% Joshua. I think that the old school D&amp;D modules were superior setting supplements to most of the new setting manual-type products for this very reason.                        </div>

                            Joshua has definitely nailed it.<br/><br/>There are many settings that I have dreamed about, but if that dream doesn't translate into real situation for actual play, it's just a solo mind exercise, or perhaps a bit of shared fantasy between the players, but creates no real play.<br/><br/>Looking back over some of my fondest game memories, I can see how setting translated into situation:<br/><br/>My favorite Cold Iron campaign used the map and bits of setting from Judges Guild's First Fantasy Campaign rendition of Dave Arneson's Blackmoor setting. The way this translated into situation was that the way I ran Cold Iron, travel from point A to point B was quite an adventure as I tossed various "random" encounters at the PCs. The encounters would be based on the terrain, and the various towns and other landmarks on the map were destinations for the PCs. Occaisionally, I would place a "dungeon" from some module and send the PCs there.<br/><br/>A favorite Traveller campaign used a setting I cooked up myself. One of the most brilliant star systems was one that had been a former penal colony, now rebelled. I don't remember all of why I got PCs to go there, but there was always excitement when they got there.<br/><br/>Tekumel flopped for me. I couldn't turn it into situation. There was all this staticness to it. And a layer of political intrigue, something that just doesn't play well for me (partly due to non-support from mechanics, partly due to that just isn't something I'm interested in). Beautiful detailed setting, crap for play.<br/><br/>Glorantha has worked for me sometimes. The cults give players reasons to engage the world, and there's lots of cool stuff you can do with the intelligent "monsters" that aren't always opposition.<br/><br/>The Diamond Throne setting for Arcana Unearthed/Evolved was a total flop. The one thing that grabbed me, the hint of potential conflict between the Mojh and the Giants, got blown to bits in my first campaign by the player who had a Mojh PC, who became a Mojh to protect his Giant master... Suddenly the setting had nothing to create situation for me. He further killed things when I started to get them to travel to someplace different, and he used teleport to negate travel. Now the setting didn't even provide a situation framework in the aspect of a map.<br/><br/>But something I've also learned - setting has to be accessible to the players also. My recent RQ campaign flopped when (most of) the players were not at all interested in learning about the setting. Suddenly we were playing "kill things and take their treasure." That's cool, if the setting supports it.<br/><br/>Encyclopedias are fun (sort of) to read, but crap all for play. If the details they present can't be turned into situation, they're just a load of fluff.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

Man, Greyhawk and Forgotten Realms bore the crap out of me.<br/><br/>Actually, I like Forgotten Realms because it provides you with a lot of power groups with varying goals, which I find the most useful when trying to think of things to challenge player goals.  I guess the geographical details were really not all that important compared to the factions in play.  With the wide variety (like with Planescape) you could usually find one that was in opposition of or made difficult the players' goals.                        </div>

I disagree.  Yes, there needs to be a situation.  However, your setting does <i>not</i> have to be the thing to guide creation of situation.  In other words, your setting doesn't have to be "a world full of adventure".  The setting can provide flavor, context, irony, or many other sorts of meaning.  For example, some of my favorite games are set in the modern or historical world.  So, I'll say something like: "My setting is London of 1893".  That's a great setting, in my opinion.  So, other favorite settings of mine:  Vinland in my Vikings &amp; Skraelings game, which was 1392 of an alternate history where the Icelandic colonies in the New World flourished rather than dying off.  <br/><br/>The <i>SItuation</i> is something apart from the Setting.  There's no reason why situation-creation has to be a part of the setting.  <br/><br/>Personally, I often like a Setting to have depth beyond the situation of the PCs -- so that it doesn't feel like the center of the setting is dungeon-crawling, shadowrunning, or whatever.  I like reading the setting and getting a feel of ordinary life there instead of "adventures".                        </div>

                            A setting is awesome if it has enough cool details to jump-start your imagination into coming up with even more cool details that all fit together.<br/>
<br/>
A setting stops being awesome when it has so many cool details that you stop adding your own stuff because you're afraid of contradicting something.<br/>
<br/>
A setting never starts being awesome if it doesn't have enough cool details to inspire your imagination in the first place.<br/>

Thus, your mileage may vary immensely. But it's all about the balance.<br/>

John, I suspect we're in screaming agreement.  When you play in London, 1893, do class conflicts, imperialism, wealth, culture, and urban living figure into the situation you play?  That's all I'm saying.  It doesn't have to be all <em>adventure!</em> to be situation.  Situation can be why your street urchin is following that stuffy professor into the abandoned tunnels below London to confront the elder gods in their fitful sleep.  Context, yes; meaning, very much so.  Excuse for killing people and taking their stuff?  Meh.  That's easy to fabricate. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            Any setting with a strong attachment to the theme; what the game is about in my actual play.

The setting is a world stripped of everything that isn't cool.<br/><br/>Tribe 8 is about survival and perseverence. The setting is a world of constant danger and oppression.<br/><br/>Basic, vanilla D&amp;D is about leveling. The setting is a world of impractical rows of baddies to plow through.<br/><br/>(edit) Ooh. The alternate settings for D&amp;D change the theme! But they keep the rules . . .

What can you do that's cool in WoD? Nothing. It's all been done in the novels and the supplements by uber-NPCs who will kill you as soon as look at you. You must defy the books to allow the players any influence over their lives.<br/><br/>Remember, this is MY actual play. Your mileage may vary.                        </br></br></div>

                            Y'all are getting it. <br/><br/>Special thanks, Brendan, for falling into my trap. I was specifically somebody would mention those settings. As it happens, I'm right now involved in a thread in which I'm "converting" Greyhawk for use with Hero Quest. Guess what? Suddenly I can see where the situation can evolve from the setting, and where the characters are going to have interesting things to do relative to the setting based on the prompts they find there. <br/><br/>But this isn't because the setting is particularly well written or anything. Again, it's just like every other setting, and includes everything you need really. As people are now pointing out, what really makes things pop is player investment in the setting. To an extent, this means making up the salient and important parts as you go. That is, grabbing from the setting those elements that you need for fun, and expanding upon them. <br/><br/>To this extent, I'd agree with what Sydney said. That there's a limit of data at which you have more than what you need to go forward. In fact, at a certain point, the data starts to get in the way of being able to mold the setting into what you need it to be for play. Note how everyone loves their homebrew, specifically because they made up what they needed as they needed it for play? Characters headed to place X? So you enumerated place X to make it interesting enough to play in. <br/><br/>Anders points this out with Zen-like clarity. <br/><br/>So, truth be told, I think that the "Awesemofie this Setting" threads are misguided except to the extent that they are about using a better system. Because, sans seeing the actual characters created, and knowing the actual players involved, and why they came to play? I don't think you can say anything about what will make a particular setting better or worse. The best setting is the one you take from what you need to produce actual play. <br/><br/>Sure, some will be more inspirational to this person or that. But when the chips are down and we start play, as long as the participants are pulling what they think is interesting from the setting - making it up if they need it - then it's all good to go. <br/><br/>In fact, I'll even say this. The only RPG settings that I don't want to play in, are those that thought that by putting in a kitchen sink approach that they'd be more fun to play. That is any setting that adds elements in, just so that it's MORE setting, under the notion that this'll make it more fun to play? Those are the worst. <br/><br/>No, even Rifts I'd play - the central conciet is not kitchen sink, but multi-universe if you use the right system (yah, with the Palladium system it blows). I'm talking about a setting like FATAL or SenZar, where you're given the option to play a flying bear with cybernetic lazer eyes "because somebody might want to play that." Those settings tend to be completely devoid of the ability to actually produce actual play, because they totally skip the part where the setting is about anything at all other than "getting to play whatever you want to play." Like, OK, now I'm a flying bear with cybernetic lazer beam eyes, and I do....what?<br/><br/>Traveller is the best example anyone has given. I loooooove the idea of 13,000 populated worlds in the Imperium, and that I know at least 7 things about each of them. Yet I never had a game run successfully for too long because, in the end, the game doesn't give you any idea of what you're supposed to do. OK, the PCs are part of a culture of interstellar travellers. OK, and so they...travel. And see stuff. OK. But why? The closest I ever got to making this work was to enforce the "Free Trader Beowulf" concept on the party, and say that they all had to stick to one starcraft. At least then all the mechanics for trading and such could sorta propel play. In fact at times play became nothing but an exercise in starship economics. Only years later do I realize that this is because the system is a "then you do whatever you want" system. <br/><br/>Like all settings, the Traveller setting is infinitely large, and has an infinite number of things to do. Unlike a setting with a good system, however, it gives you no particular idea of what play should be like, and so play meanders and dies. Not even the modules for Traveller could save it, because they're largely scripts (even their "dungeon crawls" are linear), and don't give the players any place to make decisions. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

<p>Mike, I think that, in an important part, these threads are about taking <em>out</em> stuff that isn't applicable to AP, or making it so that it is. That's the philosophy behind my Planescape suggestion: "Focus it around the impenetrable mystery of the Lady of Pain." That gives you a setting-compass to tell you what's relevant and not; you don't have a temptation to wander around in the setting making stuff up that isn't play-stuff.</p>

                            By filtering with system, system is telling you exactly the priorities, so if a detail isn't a priority based on system, out it goes (or it becomes color - but even color is informed by system). And of course system includes the players involved, so the players priorities are relevant also.<br/><br/>For some reason, this got me to thinking about using the Deadlands setting with Dogs in the Vinyard... You could use the modules to inform town creation. Hexslingers and mad scientists would become sorcerors, etc.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

<p>My question is, really, "What makes filtering with system-in-play better (please define your better) than filtering beforehand by omission?"</p>
<p>To me, it seems like filtering-by-omission is better by elegance - you never have any nonessential data.  If you are writing a setting in the context of a system (and when are we otherwise?), then aren't you doing the players a disservice by not omitting the things they won't need?</p>

                            Ok, but I thought Mike was talking about taking an existing setting and paring it down for play in a different system than originally intended. The designer paring down the setting risks removing what jazzed the players about the setting in the first place (of course if they don't choose a system that doesn't utilize what jazzes them about the setting, then they're not going to get what they want...).<br/><br/>Sure, if you're designing a setting for your system, you should only include relevant detail and sufficient color.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ffilz</cite>The Diamond Throne setting for Arcana Unearthed/Evolved was a total flop... Encyclopedias are fun (sort of) to read, but crap all for play. If the details they present can't be turned into situation, they're just a load of fluff.</blockquote>
I'm late to the discussion, but Frank, I agree about Diamond Throne.  How can Monte Cook come up with such neat classes/spells, and come up with such a dud of a setting?  Indeed, a dud of a setting horrifically infected with BFNS ("Bad Fantasy Name Syndrome")?<br/><br/>But I'd echo the consensus of this thread: the setting's job is to do only a few things-- <br/>* Provide awesome color ("The CHOAM corporation force-feeds dudes massive amounts of Spice to turn them into giant octopus-fetus monsters who can transport ships across the stars")<br/><br/>* Provide thematic resonance (any game set in Victorian England is going to include certain themes, even if they're not prominent)<br/><br/>* Hardwire themes, sometimes (see, e.g., Burning Empires)<br/><br/>I think one of the best indie supplements out there is "Sorcerer &amp; Sword," which did a great job of killing the setting-as-encyclopedia approach for me.                        </div>

                            Yeah, Shreyas, best to originally design a setting by marrying it with system, in which case ommission will be an intentional part. But in terms of taking an existing setting, I think instead of trying to say "Ignore all this stuff over here, and this one thing here, and everything about Y over there" simply employing a system that does that focusing is much easier. Yeah, the temptation will always be there to go trolling through the canon, I suppose, but that'll always be there. Unless you actually edit and re-release the text. But even then, if the players are aware of the previously released canon, they'll be tempted. Once something's been published and it's out of the bag, it's really too late to stuff it back in. The best method is to have a system that doesn't encourage players to go off hunting down the canon in question, but to focus on the important parts. <br/><br/>So, if we're looking at Awsemo-fying Planescape, I'm saying that saying "don't pay attention to X" is not nearly so effective as simply employing a system that won't promote players going off and paying attention to it. Or, rather, one that promotes them paying attention to the awesome parts. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            Originality<br/>Substance<br/>Dynamics<br/><br/>The explorative mode is essential to good gameplay. A setting of really good originality will draw you in, searching for the hidden treasures beneath the surface of the text and drawings.<br/><br/>Substance is needed for the setting to come alive. That is: you have to reckognise and identify with something in it, and it must be presented in a clear way. A clearcut substance will grab you by its solidity, necessity and consequence.<br/><br/>A roleplaying setting has to be dynamic. That is: you must be able to use it, to find the gold without having to dig and wash and swallow tons of gruel. Make the setting in easy to pick elements, ready for use, ready for inspiration and interaction. The setting must be ready to dance in the hands of the GM and the players.                        </div>

All the cool shit in the world gets boring really fast if it doesn't have a face.
