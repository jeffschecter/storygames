Bear in mind that many of them can be beaten in less than ten hours. And they've all been out for a bit (except for Dead Space), so they won't break the bank if you know where to look. Also, they're all first-person shooters, and I believe that they're all rated M (mostly for gore and language).<br/><br/>Mostly, these games deal with soldiers fighting horrific aliens and demons in outer space. Some of them feature some interesting gameplay and story mechanics. For example, Doom 3's story is relayed through notes, emails, and other messages that you can find along the way. It's possible to miss some of these, and as a player, it's your choice to examine them or to ignore them. In that way, two players can encounter different story elements during play. This kind of player-authored narrative is nowhere near as powerful as the story structure of a game like Oblivion, but it's still interesting and enjoyable, in my experience.<br/><br/>BioShock (X360, PC): This one was written by my friend Susan O'Connor. She's this great video game writer. I don't know much about the plot, because I'm really excited about this game, and I don't like spoilers. I haven't gotten around to playing it yet, but when I do, I'm setting aside at least one entire weekend for it. All my buddies who played this say the story and gameplay are just stellar. Apparently, in the first few minutes, your plane crashes and you wind up in some kind of facility on the bottom of the ocean floor. Something terrible has happened. Hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>Gears of War (X360, PC): Another one written by Susan. On the planet Sera, a race of subterranean monsters (known as the Locust Horde) tunnels up from the planet's core, and they wage war on the people that live on the surface. The Locusts establish near-complete dominance in a matter of hours. You're one of the few humans left. You're a soldier who spent the past four years in prison (court-martialed for dereliction of duty -- basically, cowardice -- which may or may not be true). You're let out of prison because all the good soldiers are dead, so the humans are throwing ex-cons at the enemy. You are handed a gun, and hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>Prey (X360, PC): Aliens abduct Tommy, a Cherokee who served in the US Army. They also seize his girlfriend and grandfather. While on the alien spacecraft, he manages to escape. He grabs a gun, and hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>Quake 4 (X360, PC): The sequel to Quake 2. During a war with nightmarish aliens, a marine is captured and tortured by the enemy. He escapes, but the procedure has both disfigured him and granted him certain abilities. Hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>Doom 3 (X360, PC): A marine on a remote military base is the sole survivor of a demonic invasion. He grabs a gun, and hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>Aliens vs. Predator (PC): A great game that -- tragically -- has not yet been released on consoles. There have been other AvP games, but they were either side-scrolling shooters, or strategy games, or took some other form that sucked all the joy from the concept. This game, though, is a blast -- and it's so much better than the execrable movie. Imagine the first Predator movie, combined with Aliens, and you can play any one of the three races. As a Marine, you try to kill Aliens and Predators. You carry conventional weapons, and it's basically horror-action monster-hunting in space. As a Predator, you hunt Marines and Aliens, and you use all of those nifty Predator weapons. As an Alien, you don't have any weapon except for your claws and your bite, but you're incredibly fast, and you can climb along walls and ceilings to the get the drop on your prey. At which point hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>Aliens vs. Predator 2 (PC): Same as the first, but with some great new features. For instance, as an alien, you start as a facehugger, and you must 'impregnate' someone. Then you become a chest-burster, and you have to fight your way out of someone's body. And then you molt and become a drone (at which point, yes, hilarity ensues).<br/><br/>Resistance: Fall of Man (PS3): Not set in space. However, it's got a fairly intriguing premise. After World War 1, a peace accord in Europe leads to an alliance. There's no Great Depression, no World War 2. Everyone is happy and everything is nice. Then, in 1950, aliens attack. Russia falls, then Europe. The aliens then invade England. The plucky Brits give them what-for, and hilarity ensues. Of course, you don't play a person from England, you play a grim and stubbled American soldier. I think that I might have liked the game just a little better if the player character had been a chubby fellow from Daleshire-over-Lathersby named Reginald Coodlesridge Ramsbottom. But even though the player character's a bit of a cliche, the gameplay is solid (if a little too difficult in the very beginning). <br/><br/>Dead Space (PS3, X360): Next year, EA will be releasing Dead Space, a survival horror game set aboard a derelict ship floating in space. Not sure what else is going on with this game, since I'm really excited about it and so I'm avoiding spoilers.<br/><br/>Okay, hopefully some of those will prove useful!<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105122/#Comment_105122" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T09:34:01+00:00" title="October 27, 2007  9:34AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The most disturbing science fiction book I've ever read was Solaris by Stanislaw Lem. It was disturbing because the scenario it presented was completely alien and it provided no easy answers as to what was happening. Was the planet an intelligence reacting to the humans studying it, or were their thoughts and memories being reflected back by some unknown natural force? The horror comes in when the characters realise that whatever they're dealing with is outside the realm of their knowledge and that the planet seems to know much more about them, than they do about it. The book is great, and I highly recommend it. I hate to say it, but the (American) movie doesn't really convey this nearly as well as the book. It leaves out some really freaky scenes.<br/><br/>Gene Wolfe's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_New_Sun" rel="nofollow">The Book of the New Sun</a> series is set in the dying days of Earth, where layers upon layers of cultures, technologies and scattered bits of knowledge have accumulated into an ungodly mess of weirdness. Some really strange shit happens in these books, and a lot of it isn't explained, leaving one sort of unbalanced and unsure of what to expect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105127/#Comment_105127" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T10:03:18+00:00" title="October 27, 2007 10:03AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            5 Days a Stranger is brilliant, Temple.

With the exception of Unreal, Battlefield 1942, and the aforementioned AvP titles, I don't play PC games at all. I know that System Shock 2 is supposed to be quite good, but knowing next to nothing about it, I wasn't sure I could recommend it. Glad to hear you're giving it the thumbs-up, though. I really wish they'd release SS2 on the console -- I mean, Quake 4 (Xbox 360) includes Quake 2, and the original Doom is available on Xbox Live Arcade...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105156/#Comment_105156" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T16:09:25+00:00" title="October 27, 2007  4:09PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well if we're talking PC games, then Half-Life (1 and 2) are also obvious choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude" title="Consonant Dude"><img alt="Consonant Dude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/6858/fhjfhffblack2iv7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude">Consonant Dude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105157/#Comment_105157" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T16:10:20+00:00" title="October 27, 2007  4:10PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Johnson</cite>I've somehow gotten all spun up in a desire to plumb the depths of sci-fi/horror, but having hit the obvious stops of Alien and Lovecraft (not very sci-fi, but the whole mysterious horrors from the beyond has the right idea), I'm unsure where to go next.

There are plenty of sci-fi films that feature technical difficulties for the ship but few do so as effectively as Ron Howard's, IMO. It's certainly a source I use for my horror sci-fi gaming. The idea that you are going to die alone is a powerful one. You mix that up with other concepts, such as making it take place on a larger ship and having some of the crew go loco, Shining-style and things can get nasty. <br/><br/>As well, several horror concepts are not in space but are portable. Carpenter's "The Thing" is an amazing classic. Any movie that features weird organism can be translated for space. The Body Snatchers (the 70s one) or any Zombie movie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1" title="forlorn1"><img alt="forlorn1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/n6SIEC3F01EX7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1">forlorn1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105164/#Comment_105164" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T17:51:29+00:00" title="October 27, 2007  5:51PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Not considered horror but I find it scares me a LOT because I can relate to the feeling: Apollo 13 (the movie).

Since the game is built on horror movies as inspiration, we were variously using <i>The Thing</i>, <i>Alien</i>, <i>Ice Station Zebra</i> (not actually horror or sci-fi), <i>Event Horizon</i>, <i>Ghosts of Mars</i>, and <i>Final Fantasy</i>.  These sources worked well, because frozen wastelands and deep space share the same stressful atmosphere-  maddening isolation, and a hostile environment, a small group of people ready to turn on each other.

It's one of the best PC games I've ever played.<br/><br/>Following the events of System Shock, where you played a hacker fighting against an insane AI onboard a space station, System Shock 2 has you playing a soldier in cyrostatis on board the maiden flight of the first faster-than-light starship. Of course, things go wrong. You start the actual gameplay being revived after the ship has been invaded. Unfortunately, this lifeform\u2014The Many\u2014has taken over the ship's personnel and corrupted the ship's AI, XERXES. The basic plot of the game has you being guided by a doctor to where she's hiding, where you and she will attempt to strike back at the invaders, and then the actual striking back. There's a big bunch of spoilers that I could dump out, but it's really worth getting the game, playing it, and encountering the OMG moments on your own rather than reading them on an online forum.<br/><br/>The creators of the game developed Bioshock, their own "spiritual successor" to System Shock 2. (Rafael mentioned this above.) Instead of a far-future outer space adventure, Bioshock was set in an underwater city in 1960. Bioshock was released this year, System Shock 2 was released in 1997 (?).<br/><br/>GameSpot mentions this in their review of System Shock 2 as one of "The Greatest Games of All Time":<br/><br/><i>The game was scary. Damn scary. And this is not schlocky-horror-movie-style monster-closet scary, where the bogeyman jumps out at you when you least expect it. Shock 2 projected real psychological terror through the tragic grotesquery of the formerly human enemies, the urgency and grim portent of the crew members' audio logs, and the unparalleled sound design that brought the menace and forebodingness of the Von Braun to horrible life.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105382/#Comment_105382" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T11:29:46+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 11:29AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charles Stross' <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Atrocity Archive </span>is Lovecraftian, cyberpunkish, militaristic and espionage-ish.
