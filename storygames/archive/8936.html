My goals are eventually to produce an integrated system where I can pull the fun in the D&amp;D combat and leveling systems up into social infighting, intrigue, and dynastic growth. <br/><br/>One of the problems in the design of 4E D&amp;D has been that the skill subsystem and the combat subsystem don't properly link. Other than passive insight and perception, skills often feel like they should be opposed by defenses, but the math doesn't work out, because the skill system wasn't built on the same scale as the combat system. The reason is that there is no sense of damage in skill rolls, so everything must be handled by success or failure. <br/><br/>For P.Y.X. I've decided to explicitly mold skills under a combat model:<br/><br/>A skill attack uses the ability modifier for the skill for both attack and damage, with a proficiency bonus and skill damage die based on training level. Untrained characters use a d4 for that skill and +0 proficiency. Trained characters use a d8 and a +2 proficiency. The racial skill bonus translates to an additional +1 racial bonus to attack, and the skill specialty feat works just like weapon focus by adding to damage. Skill attack and damage also receive the obligatory enhancement bonuses that combat does (in P.Y.X. those are part of leveling so this is an easier change to make, but it wouldn't be hard to add a fourth requisite item slot and adjust treasure accordingly). <br/><br/>For the simplest actions, this doesn't make much of a difference, other than to make a skill attack versus a Will or a Fort defense a reasonable mechanic (a small victory in itself). The skill test has become like attacking a minion, as long as you hit it doesn't matter how much or how little damage is done. <br/><br/>Where skill attacks really matter is conflicts. <br/><br/>Conflicts are P.Y.X.'s replacement for skill challenges, loosely inspired by Dogs in the Vineyard's conflicts. At the start of a conflict two or more positions are created, each with a number of hit points (based on the level of the participants). The participants can choose sides, or in some cases have their sides chosen for them. Then the skill combat begins. This can happen in place of a physical combat (in which case Int is used in place of Dex for initiative), during combat encounters, or even over the course of several other encounters and conflicts. <br/><br/>The hit points of each position represent a buffer, and they are depleted by the skill attacks. In the simplest case, a single character may be struggling to complete a task (such as disarming a trap before it fully activates) by hacking it's buffer down. When the position runs out of hit points it is defeated, unless one or more characters have joined it and continue to hold it, taking damage in it's place - this represents the effort required to uphold the sinking ship. When only one position remain undefeated it's outcome occurs. <br/><br/>Added to this are some basic maneuvers, letting characters bolster positions with healing surges second wind style, letting them abandon positions, letting them make the occasional skill attack as a minor action (to facilitate joint combat/conflict situations). <br/><br/>It is remarkable what can arise from simply following what already works.<br/><br/>    - Mendel S.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197356/#Comment_197356" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T06:12:21+00:00" title="March 17, 2009  6:12AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel, this is an interesting approach to a problem <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/mouse-guard-lessons-for-4e/" rel="nofollow">I've been</a> thinking <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2009/03/16/making-4e-work-for-me/" rel="nofollow">about too</a>.

Although, I think there is something to be said for unifying the mechanics even as the scopes of skills and combat remain distinct. Among other things it requires less additional design when making combat powers relevent in skill situations, because they share the same mechanical basis.<br/><br/>I was remembering when I first starting trying to fix the skill challenge mechanics, and was wondering about ways to link the use of powers to make them a resource in challenges. Ultimately it seemed lots of work for a secondary use of the powers. <br/><br/>With this hack though, if a player wants to stunt in one of their attacks or combat utilities, it becomes a much simpler matter. Imagine a swordmage slighted in a debate, and giving back a truly icy retort with Frost Backlash. Or a ranger Yielding Ground to leave her companions with a better defended position. And I can imagine some particularly amusing hijinks on behalf of a Warlord using Opening Shove to appropriately re-arrange a few romantic conflicts during a ball. <br/><br/>Although I must say, I'll be intrigued to see where you take things. I've always found it interesting in the past.<br/><br/><br/>Stephen,<br/><br/>Things are much further along than what I've posted here. Some things to look forward to:<br/><br/><br/>Pick a Fight - daily (sort-of) fighter power : start a combat encounter with members of an organization, if you win deal damage to that organization<br/><br/>Vendetta - story (~1/level) clan power : start a vendetta event, just yourself or with others, gives you additional daily powers to work to weaken the organization you have the vendetta against. This event ends when that organization is destroyed.<br/><br/>A "ritual" that allows you to find a lover and another one that lets you build a family.<br/><br/>A racial power that lets half-elves kill people by being really disapproving.<br/><br/><br/>P.Y.X. originally stands for a Chinese word, but since the setting will be invented via a lexicon game which will be running in parallel with the design / development process, the actual name may change. <br/><br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197492/#Comment_197492" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T16:23:52+00:00" title="March 17, 2009  4:23PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel, yeah, I totally agree that this would be much easier if the average difficulty of hitting a level-appropriate enemy and the average difficulty of a level-appropriate skill obstacle were the same (and the bonuses you applied to each one were on roughly the same scale).<br/><br/>PYX is Chinese?

The difference is between (for example):<br/><br/>Dex 20 Halfling Rogue with Skill Specialty Thievery and a Dex 8 untrained character:<br/><br/>+5 (ability) + 3 (proficiency, 2 for trained, 1 for racial) for + 8 attack and 1d8 damage + 5 (ability) + 1 damage (skill specialty) <br/><br/>versus -1 (ability) for -1 attack and 1d4 - 1 damage.<br/><br/>The Optimized character will hit the default defense of 13 on a 5+, the anti-optimized one on a 14+, although the former will be far more effective on a hit. And anyway, this comparison is somewhat silly, because our anti-optimized character almost certainly has a better option, even if it's just another untrained skill with a better ability score. <br/><br/>One of the real advantages of these mechanics is that they help give even untrained folks the ability to contribute. Not to mentioning a whole to new power type: Skill Attacks are meant to parallel Attacks and Utilities - giving some heroic (and beyond) options for dealing with skill conflicts beyond the basic skill attack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198058/#Comment_198058" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T11:29:35+00:00" title="March 20, 2009 11:29AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And an example conflict:<br/><br/>Persuading a recurring villain's lieutenant to join your side: (Lead is the party member who initiates the persuasion.)<br/><br/>Key Skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Insight<br/>Positions:<br/>  Lieutenant Turns You Down: Lieutenant's Level x 4 + Lieutenant's Charisma  (Defense = Best Will or Default)<br/>  Lieutenant Joins Your Side: Lead's Level x 4 + Lead's Charisma  (Defense = Best Will or Default)<br/>Special: The Lieutenant abandons the Lieutenant Turns You Down as a free action when it is reduced to 0 hit points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198061/#Comment_198061" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T11:35:22+00:00" title="March 20, 2009 11:35AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't stunts and consequences for skill challenges link the skills to combat?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198071/#Comment_198071" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T12:15:01+00:00" title="March 20, 2009 12:15PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd,<br/><br/>My goal here isn't to connect skills and combat, that's more of a side-effect. My goal is to improve the skill subsystem. <br/><br/>My main criticism, is that the core skill mechanics don't work as well as the core combat mechanics, so I making skills more like combat instead. Skill attacks don't (generally) deal damage against characters or monsters, just positions in conflicts. Skills and combat remain as two different worlds, but they share a common language - the language which all in all works better.<br/><br/>This has an added bonus of making stunts easier, because you can translate between the two systems much more easily. You avoid hidden traps like rolling Intimidate against Will defenses and guessing for the skill effect of a daily attack power. <br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
