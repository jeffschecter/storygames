Of course, the keep is somewhat rundown after a gang of goblins occupied the place, and clearing them out will be the first issue to be addressed. After that, the PCs will be tasked with the repair of the keep and the protection of the nearby village. Roving monsters will need to be hunted, alliances forged, and rivals appeased or outmaneuvered. Lots of coin is needed to fix up the keep and it's lands, either by reclaiming nearby resources or discovering lost treasures.<br/><br/>What are your thoughts on this as a starting point for a game of Dungeon World? How would you do it, what dangers could be faced?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443523/#Comment_443523" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-01T21:28:00+00:00" title="March  1, 2015  9:28PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems more like it should be Apocalypse World rather than Dungeon World.

The Birthright setting was entirely focused on it (with the whole bloodline powers thing thrown in). In other words, it's been around as long as modern rpgs and there's quite a bit of potential material out there, even if much of it would require adaptation.<br/><br/>I've found that it works best in solo games in that you don't have to have power disparity or competition among the players. We had a long running BECMI campaign based upon it, with various drop-in players filling roles in the primary player's kingdom. At the lower levels the kingdom was controlled by an npc regent, and most of the adventuring was the main character proving himself, and gaining the support of the people to ascend the throne. Mid-level was kingdom building, and upper level wars and expansion. Probably our MOST story-driven, roleplaying &amp; character focused game of my 30+ years of gaming. Regularly went whole evenings with at most a handful of rolls. <br/><br/>In addition to the things you mention there's infinite room for political intrigue, large scale wars, family development with power struggles, collaborative world building, dm/player role reversal (with the players preparing defenses against DM incursions), and so on. Not sure exactly how the specifics would play out in DW versus other games, but the basic themes should all translate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443528/#Comment_443528" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-01T23:56:16+00:00" title="March  1, 2015 11:56PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having played and run games like that, the first and most important thing I can say is that it's almost essential to make "You will be owning a keep and running the lands around it" part of the initial pitch for the game.

FWIW, one of my very best-received gaming experiences was running an AW:DA playtest minicampaign- the game, the world, the characters, just would not have worked in DW, if I can get all system matters-y.  A DW party is a bunch of a Troll-Killer murderhobos by default.<br/><br/>I'd imagine the DW engine will tend to emphasise and reward 'adventuring' as the answer to many questions of rulership.  (At least until the Wizard makes the keep a Place of Power).  Might get a bit Questing Knights of the Round Table-y?  If that's the game for your group, then great!  You might want to change say the end of session XP rewards in DW to ones more focused on improving their fiefdom.<br/><br/>For me, I'd want to focus on different answers (and questions), so my response to your original question would be 'I'd make DW more like AW:DA...', which isn't much use if you've rejected it already.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443534/#Comment_443534" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T03:55:41+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  3:55AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2015 3:56AM by Cneph.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> (Letting the things no one is actually interested in be handled "off-screen" is another good idea; because, yeah, it's tempting to be all "Ah ha!

As I said, early D&amp;D worked fine for some in providing a certain type of Lording experience as it was always integrated with the game and a lot of material was published for it.

By being so generalized it was approachable (as well as being innovative for the time), and broad enough to let each group find their own thing and expand it however they chose. While there's benefits to having each aspect more fully developed (like several are in modern adaptations), in such a far reaching game I can't begin to imagine how huge and potentially unwieldy that system would become.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443606/#Comment_443606" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-03T17:15:13+00:00" title="March  3, 2015  5:15PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great points.<br/><br/>I've played OD&amp;D with people who had all kinds of interesting interpretations, including one group which said, "We read the original rules very carefully, and it says what dice you roll for your hit points, but it never says *when* you should roll them!" <br/><br/>And then they had various guidelines for when to roll, but it was never during character creation.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443634/#Comment_443634" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-04T01:19:51+00:00" title="March  4, 2015  1:19AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not too much I can say that hasn't already been mentioned, but I will expound upon a point that was touched tangentially:<br/><br/>From running and playing in a couple of these types of games, I've found it's best to have the players sit down before they begin play and decide on the governing structure of their kingdom.  Do they want to nominate one PC to be the lord and all others his counselors?  Are they a shadowy cabal who will install a puppet NPC while they work unseen from behind the curtain?  Do they each have their own Lordly title and their own fiefdom, making them a loosely unified group of Lords trying to manage their own affairs but help their allies as well?  Obviously, this is not an exhaustive list, but it's trying to illustrate that the players should know what they're headed for and have an idea how to implement it. That way, they don't get bogged down or annoyed that Jane has all the power and they're just lowly servants.  <br/><br/>Your typical dnd-type game has a much more egalitarian bent: they all level roughly at the same time, they all gain treasure at the same rate, they all gain magic items around the same time.  Something like this has the potential to throw that familiar balance out of whack.<br/><br/>Finally, I would second the notion that you should look to change some of those DW end of session questions to more accurately reflect this style of play.  Maybe instead of "Did we loot a memorable treasure?" it should be, "Did we successfully expand our influence?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443646/#Comment_443646" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-04T06:07:56+00:00" title="March  4, 2015  6:07AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great point. <br/><br/>Building off of this:<blockquote>Your typical dnd-type game has a much more egalitarian bent: they all level roughly at the same time, they all gain treasure at the same rate, they all gain magic items around the same time.

(It's just, y'know, less lucrative than killing things and taking their stuff. But safer, I guess?)<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443857/#Comment_443857" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-09T14:31:55+00:00" title="March  9, 2015  2:31PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what's the most hygienic way to do this? <br/><br/>In my mind it's either to form the players up into a disembodied narrative committee that have a stable of influential characters that they manoeuvre by consent against the DM controlling the forces that threaten the kingdom. Want more information about the enemy kingdom, roll up a Spy into the stable and start dealing with his adventures every turn, moving the spy-piece across the hex map. <br/><br/>Or it's to give each player a noble PC who controls a keep and a village and then works to pacify the DM controlled wilderness and expand their influence, competing or corroborating with other players. The conceit would be that the PCs all serve the same king so open warfare against one another would be discouraged (unless the players fancy some to-the-hilt PvP), but every winter (each 4th turn) the nobles would be summoned to the capital to receive favours depending on their success.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
