The game was fun but something I had trouble with was coming up with NPCs qualities. I knew that I wanted him to have 5 levels of qualities and quickly split them up into +6 +4 and +2. My problem is when I had to come up with descriptors for the qualities. I didn't really have a list to choose from and coming up with these descriptors is difficult. You have to think about what the NPC is about and come up with quality names for them. It is kind of like when you stumble for a name in a hurry and end up coming up with something really lame only you have to come up with 2-4 names per NPC.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've had the same problem with aspects in SotC. Does anyone have any suggestions on coming up with good descriptors on the fly?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196611/#Comment_196611" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-11T20:39:16+00:00" title="March 11, 2009  8:39PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would just name the ones that I know work and figure the other ones out during play based upon what seems organic to the story and the interactions with the PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cczernia" title="cczernia"><img alt="cczernia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zerneeak.com/avatar_mini.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cczernia">cczernia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196763/#Comment_196763" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T22:59:44+00:00" title="March 12, 2009 10:59PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This would work if the NPC was going to last a while in the adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that sometimes I need to use the skills/aspects right away.

Think of what you want the person to be like, find a stereotype that matches it, and pick qualities for the stereotype. If the character isn't going to be around for long, you don't need particularly interesting qualities. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, depending on the mood of the game, you can pick completely arbitrary things, like "loves cookies" "wants to be a ballerina" "french accent" "Hollyhock is my middle name" or "pyromaniac".<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sort of advice may not work for you, though.

However, for FATE I was actually thinking about aspects created during conflicts when I posted.<br/><br/>Some good advice on running SOTC that I've heard is that the GM's job is to keep pushing hard enough on the players to get them to spend FATE. Once the FATE economy is humming, players are more apt to take compels, to use invokes, tags, place aspects on the scene or NPCs, etc. So, if I was stuck for aspects on an NPC I'd leave some of em blank and then decide during the conflict if I was rolling enough to dice to push on the players. If not, I'd give him an aspect that fit the NPC and scene and invoke it. Hopefully, a juicy aspect that the players might be able to tag as well. My baddie might be "Stubborn as a mule" for instance, or "hellbent on destruction" or whatever was needed at that moment to make things interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
