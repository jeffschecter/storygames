                    By ploy, I mean a course of action you can take which may alter the situation to your advantage, but will cost you <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">if it fails</span>.<br/><br/>Trollbabe has several ploylike things (not by that name) available to the player: An Unexpected Ally, A Remembered Spell, etc. These are not true ploys, however, because they are more like "fortunate coincidences" than "risky things the character tries". They are ploylike in effect but not in content.<br/><br/>Examples of ploys:<br/><br/>A Dangerous Shortcut.<br/>An Untrusted Ally.<br/>A Desperate Leap.<br/>A Wild Burst of Firing.<br/>A Last-Ditch Defence.<br/><br/>I don't have a mechanic for this worked out yet but I'm sure there are many possibilities. The Trollbabe ones give you a reroll, if I recall correctly. But there should be some downside (either potential or inevitable), apart from "you can't use it again this session".<br/><br/>Any thoughts? Idea have legs?                </div>

                            Mike, we see this all the time in fiction, teevee, and film, but it almost always succeeds in the end.  The "danger" never manifests.  (Or the ploy only fails when it occurs at the beginning of the piece, and then it's a means to set up the situation.)  In gaming, this sort of all-or-nothing tactic is very problematic, because if the PCs lose on it, it can very easily kill the game.<br/><br/>How do you accomodate that?                        </div>

                            Okay, so game X has two types of Traits: Simple and Problematic.<br/><br/>Each Simple Trait has a Ploy.<br/>You can use the Ploy in the same way that you can simply Buyoff a Key in TSoY.<br/><br/>Utilizing a Ploy jeopardizes the straightforwardness of a Simple Trait.<br/>If the ploy fails, that trait is now permanently problematic.<br/><br/>That way, the game isn't killed, there is a risk, but there is also a benefit - if the ploy works, you get to keep it and the trait stays simple.                        </div>

                            Joshua, that was kind of what I was driving at but not expressing well. This is something to pull out when you're eyeball-deep in alligators, outgunned, outclassed and outmanouvered, and you really, really, really don't want to fail.<br/><br/>The ploy ensures that you don't fail. It does so spectacularly. But it also has a cost - which may be a "cost" to the characters (greatly increased complexity, more obstacles between them and their ultimate goal, new issues to deal with as Joe suggests), but is a benefit to the enjoyment of the players because now the story is even more interesting.                        </div>

                            There's a John Wick (I think) trick that I'm only faintly remembering that handles this pretty nicely.  You start play with a bowl of white stones which players can take and spend for some positive effect.  Players are free to take stones any time they want, but every time a player takes a stone (or possibly under other circumstances) the GM tosses in a black stone.  Since draws are blind, the more often you pull from this, the more likely you are to pull a black stone, which has some specific mechanical bad effect.  This gives you the opportunity to do risky things (ploys) but with escalating risk.  Not a 100% match, but I think it's in the spirit.<br/><br/>One other option is to (Stealing a nerdword back to it's real use) allow players to stake mechanical elements of their sheet on on an outcome.  This doesn't work for every type of game, but for games that have elements like aspects or other personal elements with a mechanical meaning, it  allows for genuine double or nothing giving the character a greater bonus than usual, but removing the element from their sheet (Temporarily or permanently) if some condition is not met.  Now, "Failing" is technically a viable option for not meeting conditions, but I think that runs the risk of being mechanically unsatisfying - the player is doing this with a reasonable expectation of success, and failure is probably already bad enough that it doesn't need something else.  There's a gambling issue of perceived cost that tends to make greater consequences of failure decrease in impact once the initial cost is established that I think outlines this issue pretty well.  If players already don't like failure enough to be looking for a ploy, making failure worse won't move their needle much.<br/><br/>If, instead, the stakes are on something specific - some subset of the conflict, or some secondary issue - then you get some juice again.  Perhaps something akin to the declaration and qualification of Mortal Coil or Polaris would serve here:  "My Faith in My Father gives me the strength to survive this..." "...But only if the child is unharmed".<br/><br/>I admit, I like taking the price directly out of the player's hides.  Unless you're playing a mechanical opposition game, like Rune or Agon, adding complexity or challenges are briar patch punishments.  I get to take a big bonus and my punishment is that there's more cool stuff to fight? Oh, no! Not that! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/><br/>The exact nature of the bonus is also an interesting question.  Consider: is the player's concern that they succeed (that they desire a specific outcome) or that they not fail (Thatthey wish to avoid a specific outcome)?  That question alone opens up interesting negotiation possibilities.<br/><br/>One last option that worked really well was by using a currency for it, but making it insanely rare.  The old WEG did an awesome job with this with Force Points in Star Wars.  They were _crazy_ powerful, but you had *1* and if you used it in a non-heroic fashion, you wouldn't get it back.    You had to do something awesome just to break even, but if the awesome thing was blowing-up-the-deathstar awesome, you'd get it back with a bonus.  How tightly this was controlled probably varied from group to group, but my experience with it was very tight fisted, and it really managed to produce the desired outcome: The ability to pull it out of the fire when you _really_ needed to but strong incentive to try everything else you could first.<br/><br/>Kind of rambly, I know, but it's an issue near and dear to my heart. <br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            OK, my latest thinking on this.<br/><br/>So instead of bonus and penalty dice like in say TSOY, you get â€œrisk diceâ€ in a given situation. These are dice of a different colour which cancel out your dice if they show the same value. So if you roll three risk dice vs your five skill dice, and the risk dice come up 1 3 6 and the skill dice 1 2 2 4 6, you lose the 1 and the 6.<br/><br/>Now, depending on other circumstances, some of these numbers are successes and some are failures, so risk dice can remove failures as well as successes (letâ€™s say 1 is a failure here and 6 is a success for our example). The cool thing is that (in the game I am envisioning) the numbers for success and failure shift according to your fatigue and injury levels, so if you are in a state where you would normally expect to succeed, risk dice hinder that, but if you are in a state where you would expect to have a high chance of failure, more risk means you are actually more likely to pull it off. (This isnâ€™t â€œrealisticâ€ but is reflective of a particular kind of story, which is the kind of story I have in mind.)<br/><br/>In the example, the 3 is left over from the risk dice, and that means you take a hit to your fatigue, which in turn changes what is a success for the next round. (Perhaps odds hit fatigue and evens hit injury, or something.)<br/><br/>Opposition is a special case of risk dice; by exercising a skill against your opponent, you are creating the risk that your opponent will fail.<br/><br/>When you invoke a ploy, two things happen:<br/><br/>1.	You nominate a skill you are using to create extra risk against your opposition (the opposition may be a non-personal challenge or a person attempting something). The opposition gets as many risk dice as you have levels in that skill to weigh against what they are attempting.<br/>2.	You also nominate something you care about to receive the same number of risk dice, against an appropriate skill you are using to try to protect it.<br/><br/>So, for example, you have the skill â€œLocal Area Knowledgeâ€ at 5, and invoke the ploy â€œSecret Shortcutâ€, meaning that you can add 5 risk dice against your opponentâ€™s attempt to escape you. However, you put your horse at risk because youâ€™re riding down this steep, narrow path to try to cut the bandits off. You roll 5 risk dice against your horseriding skill, and if you end up with more failures than successes, your horse breaks its leg.<br/><br/>(Probably instead of two rolls of the risk dice you just do the one roll.)                        </div>

Sorry I didn't respond earlier...<br/>Simple Traits are able to be used without spending any resources, risking any relationships, getting yourself into trouble.<br/>Problematic Traits require some resources to use, risk relationships, complicate the scenario, or something like that.<br/><br/>Here's how it would work in Perfect:<br/>Simple Traits don't have Fallouts attached, Problematic Traits do.                        </div>
