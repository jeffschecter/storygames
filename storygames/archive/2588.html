Is Capitalization (or other differentiators) a distracting interruption to normal expectations of sentence construction?  Or are they welcome signposts that remind the reader that key concepts are being discussed?<br/><br/>I'm kind of on the fence with this.  I find that it's helpful when key concepts are called out in the text in some fashion (makes skimming easier).  But it can be exhausting and disconcerting to read a paragraph dense with non-traditional capitalization or font use.<br/><br/>Your comments and experience (as creators and users of game design texts) appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59347/#Comment_59347" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T14:40:07+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  2:40PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Overcapitalization tires out the eye.

The style-and-define is ripped right from mid-level technical tutorial books.  Higher level texts don't style defined terms at all, or use jargon with the assumption that the audience understands it already, which usually means finding a definition (idempotent, isosynchronous) or figuring out the meaning from context.  Pulling the definitions is also common in more introductory texts.<br/><br/>I'm surprised Josh BishopRoby hasn't already gone buck wild here, seeing as how he <em>edits school textbooks all day.</em><br/><br/>In an early draft of Greylight, I was using the Capitalized Mechanical Terms, and in a sort of crux paragraph is read like a German Book about Role Playing Games where every Noun Phrase had Capital Letters and was a Staggering Feat to read without suffering a Complete Mental Failure.

And we started capitalizing all of these. So we'd get sentences like "When Framing a Scene the Framing Player must establish Time, Location, and Introduce at least one Component. He may not be Interrupted before he has made this first Introduction."<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the big problem with this (other than the capitalization becoming useless in the mess). Notice how Framing and Framing Player are both capitalized? They have unique meanings in the game, of course, but what you should avoid are making new jargon terms from the existing ones just by modifying the term for situation. Instead the sentence should say "the player doing the Framing." Yes, it's more wordy, but you avoid creating a new term by doing so. Framing has been defined, and we know what a player is, so we don't need an additional capitalized term that indicates the player who is doing the framing. Similarly, it's Introduce or Introduction, depending on if you want a verb or noun for your term. And you probably want a noun. Because it's far less awkward to say, "...until he has made an Introduction" than to have to say, "He may not be Interrupted until he does Introduce a component."<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as a practical example. I believe that it was Rich Forest who taught me this lesson.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59946/#Comment_59946" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T12:34:19+00:00" title="March  8, 2007 12:34PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Forests of capitals remind me of the blurbs on those genre-fantasy novels that I pick up in the library and always put down again after reading about two sentences of the blurb. "The T'Tin are invading G'foth, and Plador, the Man in White, is all that stands between the High Falutin and the fanatical Mazors..."<br><br>So I try not to capitalize too many words unless not doing so will lead to confusion between the technical sense in which I am using them and the sense they normally carry. For example, in City of Masks I capitalize "Face" when I'm referring to the social currency, because I also refer to faces meaning the things on the front of people's heads. But "mask" I leave uncapitalized because it's clear what I'm referring to.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59959/#Comment_59959" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T13:20:54+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  1:20PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>"The T'Tin are invading G'foth, and Plador, the Man in White, is all that stands between the High Falutin and the fanatical Mazors..."</blockquote>\n<img alt="image" src="http://www.xorph.com/magestrike/logo.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59991/#Comment_59991" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T15:02:14+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  3:02PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>"The T'Tin are invading G'foth, and Plador, the Man in White, is all that stands between the High Falutin and the fanatical Mazors..."<br/></blockquote>\nDude, you jest, but the next month of my life is being spent rewriting Tenra Bansho's background sections so that it doesn't look like this. :-)<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
