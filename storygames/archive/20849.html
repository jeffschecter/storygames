I'd like to use my position of privilege to be an ally to anyone and everyone, but because I lack this insight, I have trouble doing so sometimes.

The game I'm working on now is called "Just Got Real"; if the title sounds familiar, yes, it's an implicit reference to Bad Boys II, but it's a genre-agnostic game for action stories.  Rules-light, traditional GM/PC setup, with tight scene-framing and pacing rules.  <br/><br/>The "story so far" is created by the GM building a loose premise:  for example, "A cult has stolen a nuclear submarine from the US Navy base in Alameda.  They are attempting to extract concessions from the US using their new presence as a \u201cnuclear state\u201d as leverage.<br/><br/>The GM then asks the players a series of leading questions to fill out the details:\n<ul><li>Who are they?</li><li>What are their demands?</li><li>Have they performed terrorist deeds before?  What was the outcome?</li><li>Who are the PCs?  Why do they have jurisdiction to stop them?</li></ul>\nThe design goals I am trying to hit with the game are quick pacing and play, allowing all players to have their fair share of spotlight time by explicitly focusing scene cuts around each PC,  and making all the players invested in the story by drafting their help in creating it.<br/><br/>It's that last one that I'm drilling into here; since this game isn't about one setting in particular (instead about a genre in the large), I can't necessarily bake folks outside the white, cis-gender, heterosexual default into the setting, but I want to make sure my design is welcoming for everyone.  At present, I'm trying to support that by not assuming defaults at all, and drawing up example settings and characters without drilling into gender, sexuality, and race at all, and leaving the door open for anyone to fill in what they want in their action story.  But are there more or better steps I could take to fulfill that goal?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457703/#Comment_457703" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-31T01:32:53+00:00" title="October 31, 2016  1:32AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2016 1:39AM by David_Berg.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, okay, this is for a game!<br/><br/>An action story game.<br/><br/>I'd say the easiest options for inclusiveness in general are:<br/><br/>- Make sure your rules give every participant an equal voice.<br/>- Write your instructional text without defaulting to male pronouns and the like.<br/>- If you have examples of characters, make those characters diverse.<br/>- If you have examples of situations, make those situations diverse, meaning not just the sorts of action stories traditionally aimed at hetero men.<br/>- Make sure your rules are supportive of such situations, rather than funneling everything into punching matches or whatnot.<br/><br/>The reading and playing of the game will still take place in a cultural context that may not be as inclusive as you'd hope -- if you wish to fight <i>that</i>, I think you'd need to go a good deal further, but I can't claim any expertise on that front.<br/><br/>Hoping someone with more experience will chime in!<br/><br/>P.S.

I keep discovering - to my horror - more and more ways that I've been exclusive over the years. Only recently at a games convention some parents asked me to run a game to introduce their young children to RPGs and I found I hadn't updated the pregens for the particular genre they chose to my current standards. (All my pregens these days come in a choice of gender - identical character sheets laminated back to back with different names and illustrations. With a range of racial and cultural types available across the spread.) One young girl didn't have a range of characters to choose from and had to pick the only available female. I made sure I updated all my convention pregens to my new standards as soon as I got home.<br/><br/>BUT we haven't had to live it and - coming late to the table - shouldn't get on our soapbox and proclaim the evils of the world and announce that WE'RE going to solve things.<br/><br/>The best thing to do is to keep quiet and to do no further harm. If you try TOO hard, it comes across as tokenism. "Bad Boys" is a specific case but, in general, if you wanted to truly simulate 1980/90s cop shows and films you'd be required to have a black Police Chief, in the same way that to simulate Sci Fi shows you'd need a black guy as the "warrior" figure. Because of the tokenism/positive discrimination/affirmative action - whatever you want to call it - prevalent when they were made.<br/><br/>Don't try to "fix" things. Just make sure that the example characters in your rules are at least 50% female and all have generic names so that readers can picture them in their heads however they choose. <br/><br/>If you're lucky enough to go to publication, make sure the ART presents a range of cultural and racial types, but don't make a big issue of it. The central figure on the cover of my most recent games is now always a strong black female character. It's got nothing to do with the game and I don't draw attention to it, it's just something I do.<br/><br/>There's no way to hard code "inclusivity" into the rules and it gives the wrong message if you try to do it. However, there are things that you can do within your setting. For my SteamPunk game, I was well aware that some people can bring in Proto-Victorian colonial attitudes so I deliberately wrote my setting to make it clear that Prince Albert has brought forward social change and turned the British Empire into a Commonwealth of nations a century early and that people from India, the West Indies, Africa are all considered "British". Of course that means we need somebody else to be the protagonists and, I'm sorry, the Hun and the Yanks got to fill that slot. You can't please everyone.<br/><br/>For YOUR game I'd say the trap lies in the fact that the bad guys in the films are almost always Identified by their racial groups. "The Cubans", "The Mafia", "The RUSSIAN Mafia", "Yardies", "Ku Klux Klan" etc. If you stick to this template, then make sure that for every negative image you include, you include at least as many positive images from that same group. Personally, I'd rip it up and invent a pan-global syndicate containing bad guys of every stripe. I know this is more GI Joe than Bad Boys but it's safer.<br/><br/>But whatever you decide to do, just do it quietly behind the curtain. Don't bang on about it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimD" title="JimD"><img alt="JimD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimD">JimD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457774/#Comment_457774" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-01T20:33:48+00:00" title="November  1, 2016  8:33PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">@Simonpaulburley</a>, you make solid points all around.

Provide good answers to those, and you'll have a great head start on a play experience where the participants naturally include each other.<br/><br/>What's your plan for encouraging collaborative authoring?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457781/#Comment_457781" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-02T01:02:17+00:00" title="November  2, 2016  1:02AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My view, unpopular though it is, has always been that if you're not overtly excluding then you're inclusive by default. What I mean by this is that when I say: you, them, they, us, we, person, people, he, she, it, etc I'm referring to anyone who subjectively views themselves that way, and not trying to overtly classify or define others using my own biases. I adhere to this in all things, not merely game design.<br/><br/>Moreover, when I write/design something I'm doing it usually to create something either that I believe to be needed, or something that someone (myself included) wants. I don't expect or ask anyone else to need or want it, or even like/appreciate it. If they do, great, if not, please feel free not to buy/use it. Don't tell me how to do my own thing however, just to adhere to your own biases.<br/><br/>So basically I consider all political correctness a bunch of ignorant, vile horsecrap which is dangerous and destructive, and actually prevents both efficacy and equality by continuing unnecessary categorization and differentiation.<br/><br/>Not too many people ever designed a game specifically for genius, lower-middle class perverts who don't identify or belong to accepted societal/cultural groups of nearly any type, so why should I design one specifically for anyone else? Then again, That niche actually describes the original player base of D&amp;D pretty damn well, so maybe they did after all (by intent or accident).

It's all about having a safe place to spend hours taking on disposable identities based on stereotypes to experience problems which aren't yours. The most popular RPG on the planet even defines characters in terms of Race and Class and calls the guy who runs it 'Master'. And many will consider this kind of thing a waste of time, haram, or culturally 'white', regardless of how 'good' the representations are.<br/><br/>So already, <i>based simply on the fundamental properties of the medium</i>, a tabletop RPG excludes (if not offends) a bunch of people. And to just include the people I mentioned (all of whom I've encountered IRL) you're going to have to overcome massive cultural barriers in an environment where you're likely seen as a cultural threat.<br/><br/>Oh, and it doesn't matter if you're <i>not</i> a white cis male either. If fact, those trying to change the culture <i>from within</i> face greater hostility and have far more at stake than those without. Most ultimately join our 'community' if they really want to continue playing, and when we see that, we think diversity has improved. Which in a way it has, but not for reasons which allow us to expand to whole groups.<br/><br/>So despite what anyone says, the barriers you're facing are not setting and system, but cultural and economic. And if you want to be inclusive, then the best thing you can do is go out and actively invite the people you want playing your game, and let the community form from there.\n<blockquote>Forgive me if I'm misreading your tone, <a href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">@AnonAdderlan</a>, but while your message is clear (it's not enough to try to be everything to everyone, I have to take a stance), your response comes off as exceptionally harsh.  Is there something I said that was unintentionally hostile?</blockquote>\nYou weren't hostile, and I wasn't trying to be harsh, just <i>direct</i> (and a little bit sarcastic). Because these ambiguous nice guy inquiries help no one. So if my message <i>was</i> clear, who are you trying to include?\n<blockquote>All my pregens these days come in a choice of gender - identical character sheets laminated back to back with different names and illustrations. With a range of racial and cultural types available across the spread.</blockquote>\nWhy do your pregens have gender, race, and culture defined in the first place?\n<blockquote>The central figure on the cover of my most recent games is now always a strong black female character. It's got nothing to do with the game and I don't draw attention to it</blockquote>\nThen it's the very definition of tokenism (with bonus points for using the 'strong black woman' trope) and <i>you just drew attention to it here</i>.\n<blockquote>Of course that means we need somebody else to be the protagonists and, I'm sorry, the Hun and the Yanks got to fill that slot. You can't please everyone.</blockquote>\nAs a 'Yank' I find this to be... a complete non-issue.\n<blockquote>For YOUR game I'd say the trap lies in the fact that the bad guys in the films are almost always Identified by their racial groups. "The Cubans", "The Mafia", "The RUSSIAN Mafia", "Yardies", "Ku Klux Klan" etc.</blockquote>\nYeah, it <i>is</i> tricky because bad guy groups all share cultural similarities which are what make them groups in the first place. And even if you avoid representations of real world groups, you can still trip up with fictional groups which share enough similarities.\n<blockquote>To me, these sound like "avoiding negatives" rather than "adding positives".</blockquote>\nI think this is a key thing to keep in mind when dealing with issues like this, which goes far beyond RPG design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457818/#Comment_457818" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-03T00:23:35+00:00" title="November  3, 2016 12:23AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I am the "default", and</blockquote>\nAre you?<br/><br/>Actually, this sounds like an interesting place to start.<br/><br/>My - very personal, very biased - suggestion is: stop thinking of yourself as a "default" something. Stop thinking of yourself as a category, or even an overlap of categories.<br/><br/>As a new writer, start by assuming you don't know your audience. Start from yourself, with sincerity. Think of your work as something peculiar to you as an individual, coming from your personality and personal history. Do not obfuscate your individual self in your work. Introduce yourself to your audience through your work - "categories", "groups" you think you "belong" to describe you inaccurately, while your work is an authentic part of yourself you're putting out for everybody to see.<br/>It's even possible your work is of no interest whatsoever to anybody else, but you know, maybe not, maybe other individual people will individually relate to it, each in their own individual way - an act of communication. But you can't start from them and create a work in their image, because you don't know them. You have to start from your self.
