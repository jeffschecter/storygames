                    Over in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2487&amp;page=2#Item_3" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> I started a discussion of the ways in which central authority is a strong and reliable foundation for a social contract ... but it was by contrast with other stuff, and the other stuff proved so fascinating that we've had a fun discussion about it, which I wouldn't have missed.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time ... central authority!  Neat, huh?  Good for a hundred and one household uses!  Clean your floors, polish your silverware, snake your toilet ... or, even better, delegate those tasks to someone else!<br/>
<br/>
Socially, passing the <i>functional</i> buck to a central judge or arbiter seems to go along with passing the <i>social</i> buck to the same central figure.  That can be a very good thing:  human beings organize well into packs.  It's a pattern our instincts make familiar and easy.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, getting together a group of people for the first time, where I care about the long-term stability of the group (i.e. not convention games) I might well lean toward a game with central authority, purely to provide a structure for everyone to discover each other without risk of pushing dysfunctional relationships.<br/>
<br/>
How do you use this powerful tool?                </div>

                            One of the basics of family therapy (ove the last 40 years) is that groups form hierarchys. It may be very flat or highly stratified but it is always there. As a therapist I would work to help people structure it in functional ways. This always breaks down into a division of labor with responsibilities going to those with ability so parents run the house rather than kids. There is a whole body of literature on functional and dysfunctional structures that would be worth looking at. Try googling Structural Family Therapy, Salvidor Minunchin or Jay Haley.<br>
<br>
An example of hierarchy will show up right here. I just joined this group yesterday (though I've lurked for a while) so I have the least power in it. I'm not part of the regulars which means fewer people will read this post and quite likely no one will respond to it. Of course I am posting near the top of the thread so it will be looked at. The point of power and hierarchy comes from being listened to and considered.<br>
<br>
What I would ask about functional power is how well does it work at incorporating new people and how it integrates them?<br>

                            Chris:  I agree that it is a powerful <i>analytical lense</i>, in that it is totally possible to see the entire world of human relationships as a structure of hierarchy.  Personally, I think that lense distorts a lot more than it reveals.  But that would be a discussion for an entirely different thread.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm asking here is <b>how do you deliberately USE</b> the structure of central authority to make your gaming better.<br/>
<br/>
I will be very miffed ... at you! ... if this thread turns into a debate about human relationships in general, and the place of hierarchy within them.  That's totally not what I'm interested in talking about.                        </div>

                            Central authority is a highly useful tool for certain types of play.  In particular, play where the focus is on the experience of being in the game world and play where the focus is on some form of mystery or puzzle solving.<br><br>Why so?  Because by centralising authority you appoint a creator of world content or a creator of the underlying mystery.  As such, the other participants are empowered to concentrate on the experience of being in that world or solving that puzzle without having to simultaneously worry about creating part of that world.<br><br>For some players this is a really big deal, as for some the act of creating world content significantly impairs their ability to then absorb into the experience of being in that world.  For other players this is not such an issue, or experiencing the world is not so important anyway, and so it may be of less use to them.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Oh, I prefer central authority play for precisely these reasons.  In play, much of my fun comes from the experience of being in that world, and if I then also step out of character to participate during play in the creation of that world then that fun is impaired for me.  <br><br/>Also, I tend to think that a single creative vision tends to produce more interesting content than a committee job, tends being the operative word.

                            I think that central authority is good, as previously stated, for "discovery" play.  The central authority can create content that is discovered by players.  This can be a mystery, a carefully crafted world, or many other things.<br/><br/>Also, a central authority can present structured narrative.  The authority can impose a novel-like (or other) structure on a game and take the players through the story with a consistent vision.  In spite of the fact that this is not my preferred mode of play...I tend to refer to this using the term "railroading"...it can be done compellingly and I myself have seen it done very well.<br/><br/>A central authority also provides a social center for play.  When a player is unsure of what to do next, he has a clear figure to look to, a source of guidance and aid.                        </div>

                            The WoD larp rules encourage assistant storytellers to create that stratified division of labor. The central authority plans out the major events with the co-horts who then scatter through the game and disseminate to the players. Often these co-GMs are also characters of note in the game world as well to provide an in-game authority. <br/><br/>Cue the wailing and gnashing of teeth as a co-GM abuses their power like an immature forum mod. At least, that's how a dysfunctional system works.<br/><br/>In regards to my larping history; I was young and foolish.                        </div>

<p>If you could, Tony, I'd like some clarification. By "central authority", do you mean that a given mode of authority (creative authority, rules interpretation, conflict resolution) is vested in a single person, or do you mean that <em>all</em> the modes are vested in the same person?</p>

                            John:  Uh ... either?  All?  I'm talking about central authority as an <i>organizing element</i>.  You can use it to build all sorts of different social contracts, depending on where you apply it ... as you've quite reasonably pointed out.<br/>
<br/>
I do find that it's sometimes hard to separate the purely social, people-herding, side of gaming authority from the creative and rules authority though.  I sort of wonder why that is.  Maybe it's just my personal experience, and not a general pattern, though.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>What I'm asking here is<strong>how do you deliberately USE</strong>the structure of central authority to make your gaming better.</blockquote>
The main things I see using it for is ensuring that everyone get's their spotlight time, pushing ahead when consensus isn't clear, and handling continuity.  <br><br>1) Spotlight Time <br/><br/>The spotlight time issue was something that struck me while attending a seminar last weekend.  In seminars I was used to there being a moderator who would cut off people who went on to long, and made sure that other people had their turn.  With a moderator, people would raise their hands and be called on.  In this case without one, I felt I had to interrupt someone to be able to get my comments in.  Because there were a few people who would go on, it was an aggressive environment, and some people just never got to speak.  <br/><br/>2) Pushing Ahead<br/><br/>Pushing ahead when consensus isn't something I do a lot, but it comes up from time to time.  One of the interesting things about Forge-associated games is that many of them encourage the GM to do scene framing, whereas I more commonly leave that up to consensus.  The players say what they are going to do, and we skip ahead as we agree.  If someone wants to not skip ahead, they generally can.  However, there are times when I'll call something and skip to someone else, and so forth.  <br/><br/>3) Continuity<br/><br/>This is acting as a consistency check on background.  This particularly applies when you've got a game where there are secrets, but also works for other things by having attention to it.  Finding inconsistencies isn't something easily distributed -- you need to have at least one person who both knows everything and is actively looking through it.  Multiple people can add redundancy to this, but they can't split up the job.  The key thing is that by having this, I can not only create secrets (i.e. reveal new background to one or all players) but I can quickly confirm suggestions from other participants as working or not working.                        </br></br></div>

                            Balbinus just neatly summed up everything that I would have wanted to write, even down to preferring the experience of central authority play.  I haven't quite figured out what (if anything) I can enjoy in a more distributed-narrative-authority system as much as I enjoy that.<br/><br/>Unless <b>I'm</b> the central authority, I really don't want to have to step out of character to generate world content during the game.  And if I'm the central authority, I really don't want to have to play a character beyond dipping in and out of various NPC roles, so that works out neatly.  I don't mind making contributions to world content <i>outside</i> the game: ask me during character creation, solicit ideas from me at lunch during the week, send out an e-mail questionnaire, yak at me while we're riding the subway, and I'll be happy to pitch any ideas I come up with.  If they get accepted by the game's central authority and pop up in next week's session, I'll even get a little rush of pride out of it.  But once we're at the table, making up content is something that drags me away from a part of the game that I think is insanely fun, and so far that hasn't been a good tradeoff for me.                        </div>

                            I think that central authority does not have to mean just a GM. It is the notion of who has power that is important and how much authority they have to use that power. <br/>
<br/>
Tony asked what my specific experience has been (which by the way is a perfect act of central authority to direct a conversation. He starts off with agreement and ends with the corrective miffed growl at my post. It worked because the thread didn't go off topic. A+ moderating.)<br/>
<br/>
The first central authority in all games are the rules. These define what people do and how. In board games that is all the authority that is needed because they limit the range of action so much. Players move around in the world and make things happen - the rules give them authority on how to do that. RPGs give players power to make things happen as well (even in the most simulationist game). So central authority is not harmed by the idea of division of labor.<br/>
<br/>
I do Engle Matrix Games, in them the division of labor is that the players make arguments about what happens next in the world. They alone create. They can stay focused on their characters but they don't have to. As is needed for the story to work, they can say what other characters do. The rules provide a "plot track" that suggests a sequence of actions that should happen to tell the kind of story they are playing. The rule's authority is suggestive not mandated so player's range of action is not curtailed. <br/>
<br/>
One player is the referee of the game (though this role can be shared - passed around from player to player). The referee labor is to be the voice of reason. They determin the chance of success of the player's arguments. The advice I'm giving to first time referee's now is to start off giving all arguments a 50/50 chance of happening. After a couple of turns they can start using their judgement to rule some arguments stronger or weaker. Once their confidence is up they can act as a real central authority to keep games on an even keel. <br/>
<br/>
MGs are a very robust system. They work even if the players make "poor" arguments and the referee is practically random in ruling. When players make good arguments and the referee is confident in their judgement they work great. <br/>
<br/>
Unlike a narrativist RPG view of story now the effect is more detached and problem solving like. They are verstile though with the same rules working for murder mysteries, spy thrillers, action adventures, horror stories and more. <br/>
<br/>
Players who don't want to step outside of their characters in session will have problems with the division of labor because it calls on them to create. On the other hand, they are relatively easy on the referee. I've GMed games for 30 years and know how much work it is. It burns out people. This shares labor and thus saves GMs.<br/>

<p>Chris,</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>I think that central authority does not have to mean just a GM. It is the notion of who has power that is important and how much authority they have to use that power.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Yes, of course. Because "GM" is actually a bundle of several different tasks (creative control, referee, adversary, and so on) that can be assigned to different people, as we went into on the other thread. This is kind of what I was getting at with my question for clarification, because I wanted to know if Tony only meant games where the majority of authority-based tasks are vested in one person, or whether he just wanted to look at games that assigned a specific task to one person throughout play.</p>
<p>At any given time, only one person can have authority over one task. What makes games different is whether there is a process for transferring authority: How often does the authority change? What triggers the change? Games on the more collaborative end (what I would call games with fleeting authority, to use an old classification scheme) have methods for transferring authority on demand, either informally (interrupting someone in a freeform game) or formally (winning a die roll in InSpectres, etc.) I'm sure Tony is excluding games where authority is fleeting for most of the tasks.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the benefits of central authority (fleeting or fixed) boil down to "talent". To take the less glamorous task of interpreting the rules, that task usually goes to the person who's most familiar with the rules; it might shift if the rules arbiter recognizes that another player knows more about a given section of the rules, but this is an informal and usually temporary process (I can't think of any RPGs that allow formal challenges about who gets to interpret the rules.)</p>
<p>Creative authority is likewise centralized when one player is regarded as having more talent or knowledge, either overall or for a specific vision ("Bill's suggestion for a sci-fi/horror game about intelligent spiders sounds interesting. Do you have it written up, Bill? GM it!") Authority over social disputes is pretty much always assigned to the best negotiator in the group and isn't related to the game rules at all.</p>

                            I'd add "enthusiasm" to talent and knowledge above, since in my experience that's the main thing that gets other people in the group to acknowledge one person as the creative authority for the game.<br/><br/>Bill may or may not be the most talented or knowledgeable person at the table in absolute terms, but he's certainly the guy who's willing to put the most effort into crafting a sci-fi/horror game about intelligent spiders...and <i>that</i> is what's going to tip the scales towards him being the central creative authority, as opposed to just being another talented and knowledgeable participant in a shared-creative-authority game.                        </div>

<p>Maybe I'm thinking of enthusiasm as a kind of talent. The example of Bill is meant to show that, in a group where several players have GMed in the past, one person may still turn out to be the best person for a specific job. Maybe Bill has so much enthusiasm that everyone feels his game will have a lot of energy; or maybe it's just that Bill's idea sounds the most intriguing and he's the logical choice as GM because he came up with the idea and is willing to do the work to flesh it out. Or maybe three people all have idea they're enthusiastic about, but not everyone likes the other two ideas; only Bill's idea has the most support, so he wins.</p>

                            "Talent" reminds me of my old family therapy supervisor. The man was a marvel. Weird as all get out but great at helping people. His approach to structural family therapy was summed up in a book called "Courage, Competence and Change".<br/>
<br/>
Central authority without out talent/competence fails. <br/>
<br/>
I'm also interested to see what Tony is using by way of definition. Is central authority real if it floats? I think it is. We change presidents. Ancient Romans changed consuls. The government went on regardless. Once competence was lost (ie when my ancestors destroyed the empire) the state fell. <br/>

                            With a centralized GM, I find it easier to play in a no-holds-barred sandbox fashion, yet still have a unified game vision. Where a traditional board game has well-defined rules, which allows you to exploit them fully without having to worry about "playing in the proper spirit", the rulings of a GM who has a strong, consistent vision also provide the predictability that's necessary for meaningful manipulation of the game-world as an external object. (I think it's a little easier to be consistent with oneself than with a group of others.)<br/><br/>This is in addition to the advantages that Balbinus described above. I'm talking about central authority as referee or judge; the GM may or may not have made up the scenario, and may or may not be playing "the opposition" (someone else could be delegated that task), but by being fair and consistent, and as impartial as possible, the GM gives everyone else the freedom to concentrate on playing their character.                        </div>
