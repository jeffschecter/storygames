Bear with it.<br/><br/>Thinking of designers willing to make a game on commission... I don't know if it's any more unlikely than art on commission, in the end. Probably just rarer because wanting a game to carry your art is such a niche want to have - when you have art, it's not like you can't use it in other ways, you don't need a game specifically for it. But if you did, I'm sure there would be ways. For instance, generic and adaptable systems can make for potentially very short design cycles for entirely valid games.

It might not include development and writing, but it also might - artists do work at hobby prices, so why not a game designer? I could see myself doing enough game design for a small game relying on an existing system for a $100.

Even then, I couldn't guarantee it would be good, or anywhere near my best work.<br/>I doubt that someone else with a game design/publication CV would give you more certainty, or expect less money.<br/><br/>In short, I'm not sure that Eero's idea would float very far, though it's an interesting one. It's kind of like saying "Oh, I've got all this beautiful hand-planed hardwood lumber, that I logged out of my own back yard with my stallion. Instead of selling these raw materials to contractors, I'll just hire someone to come up with an interesting thing to build with them, and then to build it."<br/><br/>Now, if you knew this cool person (say, Ronald Gesher) who has written a few games you really like (say, "Dying Alone" and the prize-winning "Dragons Are Forever"), and you had a specific idea for a game that you were really juiced about... then that's a different story, perhaps. Having friends and collaborating is awesome, but that takes a certain spark, and a certain luck, and creative compatibility, and mutual enthusiasm... and it's a lot more variables than "hire a designer".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257072/#Comment_257072" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T08:02:09+00:00" title="February 18, 2010  8:02AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: northerain</cite>As for doing the opposite, it's harder than you think.

That being said, I would LOVE to be contracted to make a game about someone's art, provided that it's good art, and I get paid a reasonable amount for it. I suspect a lot of other game designers would say the same.<br/><br/>$100 isn't really workable though, as JoePub said. With me, $100 would get you about five pages of manuscript at Letter size, maybe a bit more if I got a good amount of artistic freedom. It all depends on what you're expecting really. There are a few good games out there that are that short, so who knows? I think JoePub's estimate of $1000 is a pretty decent offer for an Indie game from a good designer. You could probably get 100 pages (half-letter size) for that kind of fee.<br/><br/>That's the problem with writing though. With art, you can break it up easily into smaller portions (individual pictures) to be bought one at a time slowly over a period of time. Writing, well, it's going to be one great big lump that's not easily split in the mind. I can well understand someone balking at the idea of paying $1000 to have a game designed, because it's not easy to make a profit even out of a good RPG. It's for similar reasons that we designers have such difficulty paying a fair fee to artists for their work.<br/><br/>This is an interesting topic, maybe we should split it off into a thread of its own?<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257076/#Comment_257076" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T08:36:47+00:00" title="February 18, 2010  8:36AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The 100$ price tag was simply an example. I'm aware that any game of decent size would cost many times more. At the same time, that's the difference here. I'm selling multiple instances of illustrations, at cheap prices. Hell, I've offering 50% off on top of that. <br/>But that's my point, I can't afford to hire a game designer (nor does anyone else I think) because you can't buy bite-sized games.

It's doubtful that you'd even be able to do it with a game's system, which can feasibly be used in more than one product.

The one thing that always pains me about the Indie gaming scene is that so many games don't bother with world-building or are insanely brief and vague with their background. If you look at a lot of mainstream products, the core rules are perhaps less than a quarter of the book, with the rest being taken up with setting-specific rules or fluff material.<br/><br/>But like I said it depends what the buyer wants.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257126/#Comment_257126" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T15:36:01+00:00" title="February 18, 2010  3:36PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2010 3:36PM by Johnstone.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Destriarch</cite>And that's another point of course, presumably you'll be selling each image more than once.

I shouldn't expect that Palladium paid more than once for the repeated segments, assuming even that freelancers had anything to do with the writing - I don't know what their business model is, never having been interested in the Palladium games.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
