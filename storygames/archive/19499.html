They are on a quest together, i.e. they have to travel to a foreign land. The barbarians want to save their best friend from an evil sorcerer and the ponies need a special potion from this sorcerer to save Ponyville. So, they have to work together to achieve their goals.<br/><br/>I have a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">system</span> question: What should I do system-wise?<br/>1. Pick either one of the two systems, convert one setting to the other system?<br/>2. Run both systems in parallel within a game, i.e preparing NPC attributes in both systems?<br/>3. Convert both settings to a generic system (i.e. Fate Acclerated, Cortex Plus Leverage, AW engine)?<br/><br/>Currently, I think I'm favoring the third approach. But I would like to hear your opinion on what could work at all (or can't work) or what approach you would suggest.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Veav" title="Veav"><img alt="Veav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/007/n3BMK8VFYEJK8.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Veav">Veav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433632/#Comment_433632" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-09T17:10:33+00:00" title="June  9, 2014  5:10PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2014 6:25AM by Veav.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played Barbaren, but what is it that attracts you about this idea?  Is it the juxtaposition of barbarianism and love-and-tolerance?  I feel like all three options above are focused on "how do I map these character sheets" without addressing "these are the principles I want to enforce".  For me, the first thing that came to mind was a Trollbabe hack - a one-stat game, with a sliding scale between "barbaric" and "harmony".  Direct, to the point, constantly reinforces the divide between their behavior patterns.<br/><br/>Outside that AW would cover ya I guess, it's also nice about setting up two very different playbooks against the same system.  I don't see Fate or Cortex doing the trick... I mean, it'd <i>work</i>, but my gut says the characters from each world wouldn't feel much different.<br/><br/>(The other thing I notice is, it's a one-shot.  This one may be personal preference but I can't see the time and effort needed to marry two systems - or run both in parallel, even for character creation and conversion - being worth it for a beer-and-pretzels one-off.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433658/#Comment_433658" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-10T06:33:23+00:00" title="June 10, 2014  6:33AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Veav, what's the agenda behind it? I wouldn't use AW unless you really want a game about tough choices and sacrifice, and feel like writing entire playbooks from separate genres with the same stats. If you're aiming for a goofy romp, I say use Fate Accelerated and you could be playing in minutes, without a lot of tweaking. The trollbabe hack sounds immediately compelling but you're gonna have characters that all fall on one end of the scale- how much barbarianism is in a pony? How much friendship-is-magical is in a barbarian?

I'd probably build the world by cherry-picking both sourcebooks and doing a mash-up, but my <i>mechanics</i> would be a super-simple system like basic FUDGE or <a href="story-games.com/forums/discussion/11348/x" rel="nofollow">Roll For Shoes</a> (don't knock it - it's simple as shit to run, and awesomely effective at supporting wacky impromptu ideas).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433677/#Comment_433677" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-10T16:57:33+00:00" title="June 10, 2014  4:57PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might this <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18770/harry-potter-and-the-natural-20-how-would-you-play-this" rel="nofollow">earlier thread of mine</a> useful reading.<br/><br/>The basic idea I had, which I would apply here, would be to choose a basic and low-detail conflict resolution engine, like Primetime Adventures or The Pool or Fiasco (or even Archipelago/Archipelago II) and overlay it over the other two systems. (A simple token bidding system could work, too - whoever wants something has to give points to their adversary, who may accept or deny by bidding a higher number themselves.)<br/><br/>So, when a Barbaren character does something, you respond as a Barbaren GM. When a Little Pony does something, you respond as you would in that game. So far so good - and the schizophrenia of the whole thing is a feature, not a bug, where perhaps due to some quirk of the rules a Barbaren character can't open a door but a Pony can...<br/><br/>But whenever a situation comes up which can't be handled easily using the rules of either game as written (the most obvious example being a conflict between a Barbaren and a Pony), fall back to the "overlay" system.<br/><br/>In other words, when the rules fail, or an outcome is not obvious, or when a Barbaren starts arm-wrestling with a Pony, switch to the simpler and more general conflict resolution engine. (Maybe they each bid tokens to win the contest, for example.)<br/><br/>Perhaps you use Fiasco as your "basic engine" - if so, freeform those things which aren't covered by existing rules and have someone give that character a Black die or a White die if their fate is in question.<br/><br/>The weird emergent situations (like where a mighty Barbaren warrior can hack down a dozen monsters but can't arm-wrestle a sweet Pony) would be part of the fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433704/#Comment_433704" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-11T10:39:20+00:00" title="June 11, 2014 10:39AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The more I think about it, the more hysterical ideas I get... :-)) i.e. imagine the barbarian bringing a woman back to his to his tent, she's seeing all the ponies and thinking 'WTF??'...<br/><br/>I think I'll throw out all mechanics concerns, go with something really, really simple and encourage everyone to go nuts. :-)<br/>I'll probably go with Fate Accelerated (FAE), Risus or Lady Blackbird for that kind of stuff.<br/>Free form Fiasco-style play sounds also interesting.<br/><br/>Asif: have looked at Roll for Shoes.

Everybody plays a barbarian <i>and</i> a pony. You go through every scene twice; first as one, then the other. Same adventure, same world but... askew, slightly off. Think the Mystics and the Skeksis of The Dark Crystal. <br/><br/>  Begin to draw parallels between the characters - your barbarian is hurt, your pony is hurt. Also start introducing cross-skills; maybe after an encounter, your barbarian gains Diplomacy; at some point, your Pony just has to kick some-one. Towards the end, you end up with one character: Ponan the Barbronian who should have all the necessary skills to tackle the final challenges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433731/#Comment_433731" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-12T00:19:07+00:00" title="June 12, 2014 12:19AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the out-of-the-box ideas <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>"Ponan the Barbronian" sounds great <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> But I actually want the ponies to interact with the barbarians, not merge them.<br/>I think I'll pick a generic rules-light system and add some setting-specific details from both settings.<br/>Thanks again, everyone!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
