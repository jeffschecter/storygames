I hear interesting things from Paul about his experiences with improv on A Fistful of Games.  So, I ask you, tell me more of this improv theory.  What I know of it is little -- I'm just someone who has been gaming for a decade, watched a lot of <em>Whose Line Is It Anyway?</em>, and has lurked on these improv posts on occasion.<br/><br/>Specifically, I'm looking for texts or whatnot to read at my own time and pace.  I don't have the time &amp; energy to commit to an improv class at the moment -- I understand that that's probably the best way to experience what ya'll are talking about, but right now it's not in the cards.  So, I'm asking you to suggest books I could read and perhaps why you think that book is good, so that I might get started.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>- Ryan                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65346/#Comment_65346" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T15:23:02+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  3:23PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ryan, that's totally cool that you are getting interested in this stuff.<br/><br/>If you Wikipedia and Google the word "Improv", you will get some good sites to explore.  People have recommended the book "Impro" and it is good, but it's not an overview of the medium.  Take a look at some of the improv wikis out there and you will see what it's all about.  There are lists of games and short-form and definitions of all of these things we are talking about.  Then I think you'll be able to come back with some more focused questions for us that we can answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65353/#Comment_65353" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T16:26:24+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  4:26PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things I like about Keith Johnstone's <i>Impro </i> is that it is much more focused on "story theory" than most improv books, which tend to be technique-heavy. Oddly, I wasn't as big a fan of <i>Impro for Storytellers</i>. Recently, I've found Carol Hazenfield's <i>Acting On Impulse</i> to be useful, while I'd pass on <i>Improvise: Scene from the Inside Out</i>. I'm only a few pages into <i>Improvisation for the Theatre</i>, so no comments there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65398/#Comment_65398" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T00:20:14+00:00" title="April 26, 2007 12:20AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, there are very few decent texts.<br/><br/>The three classic ones are:\n<ul>\n<li><br/>Keith Johnstone, Impro. Slightly mad but very readable. He has an idiosyncratic style that grates on some people.<br/><br/>Viola Spolin, Improvisation for Theatre. In my opinion, an unreadable list of games, aimed at children. I don't recommend it.<br/><br/>Kim Johnson, Truth In Comedy. Readable, has a couple of good points in it, but, really, it's not worth much.</li>\n</ul>\nCaesar's idea of doing a web search is good. Remember, though, that many of them concentrate on improv games, which isn't quite the same as the theory behind improv scenes.<br/><br/>Oh, have a look at www.yesand.com. That's an improv bulletin board. That'll have linked and things.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65405/#Comment_65405" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T04:46:30+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  4:46AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And for God's sake, don't pick up <i>Truth in Comedy. </i> Or rather, be prepared to weed out the ten useful pages if you do.  Those ten pages are pretty good.<br/><br/>I like Mick Napier's book<i> Improvise.  </i>He talks about willfully breaking the rules, which is refreshing.  Lots of good exercises, too, including solo exercises.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
