I've been reading discussions here for a while, first time poster, etc.<br/><br/>I was reading <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21515/safety-in-games-tools-for-same-and-on-the-cutting-of-scenes" rel="nofollow">this interesting discussion</a>, and I realized I felt like something was missing. It seemed better to start a new discussion than to derail, though, so here I am.<br/><br/>My main question's this: is there a reason why we don't just ask each other what we're comfortable with in the moment? I don't feel like I've seen any games or guidelines recommend that, but it seems easy enough to do. Has anyone had any experiences with this approach to safety issues?<br/><br/>For context on where I'm coming from, I've made some posts on the same topic, and I think they're relevant. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/safety-and-part-17603748" rel="nofollow">Part 1</a> is a short introduction to how I see the state of safety/consent practices in the RPG scene, and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/safety-and-part-17636269" rel="nofollow">Part 2</a> is how I actually design around safety and consent in my game (which might be more interesting).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470844/#Comment_470844" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-20T20:23:57+00:00" title="March 20, 2018  8:23PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think oftentimes designers look for game design things when you could just solve it with a human thing.  I mean, a thing is always gonna try and fill in somewhere, and sometimes it's nice to let silence speak, or uncomfortableness happen.  Socializing is sometimes anxiety-inducing, but it also can be very rewarding.  <br/><br/>I'll take a break from play, where I get to plead my case about whatever made me uncomfortable or offended, then just an X-card.  I think it's an easy way out, and not much of one anyway.  Yes, it's supposed to be a safe environment.  I get that.  But it's just words and ideas.  I can certainly see it's need moreso in LARP.  Do people capitalize the acronym for live action role-playing anymore?<br/><br/>Designers are gonna look for a tool, or a dogma for a solution.  There might not always be one, certainly one that fits all instances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470846/#Comment_470846" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-20T20:48:45+00:00" title="March 20, 2018  8:48PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main difference between "just talking it out" and "designing a solution" is that in the latter you introduce the topic of discussion in a game text and give it a snappy name in the hopes that the reader might remember it when playing the game and coming face to face with a situation where this "rule" applies. The actual substance of the advice/rule could be precisely the same, and actually is in the case of several game texts that explicitly instruct the GM to observe their players and react to signs of discomfort by broaching a constructive discussion (of whatever kind the game's author thinks fits the bill).<br/><br/>In other words, it's not such a big difference. Various gaming traditions just differ on what should be called a "rule" and what should be called "advice on best practices".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/manixur" title="manixur"><img alt="manixur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/manixur">manixur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470847/#Comment_470847" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-20T20:51:15+00:00" title="March 20, 2018  8:51PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2018 8:53PM by manixur.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me clarify a bit - that's not quite what I was going for.

Taking it as a given that we want/need safety/consent systems, why is it that so many of the systems we make put the social responsibility for speaking up on the person whose boundaries are being violated? Why do we feel like we have to guess what other people want when we're sitting at a table together and can ask each other before doing something risky?<br/><br/>Edit: Missed Eero's post, so let me add one more clarifying detail: I'm proposing "explicitly asking" as a mechanical alternative to using one's judgment to evaluate potential harm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470849/#Comment_470849" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-20T21:22:50+00:00" title="March 20, 2018  9:22PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense to me, that's pretty much what I do in my home games: some explanation in advance about the nature of the game, some more explanation as we play, still more explanation when something substantially new occurs, and asking the other players about whether they're having fun, are comfortable, want something to drink, would like to play again in the future, want to get the hell out of here as soon as you unlock the door...<br/><br/>It is true, now that I think about it, that the traditional (read: unthought boilerplate) rpg text treatment about potentially touchy subjects has tended to be "think real hard, GM" more than "talk about it together". Interesting observation, that - it mirrors the general attitude where the GM is the subjective actor while the other players are there primarily to be acted upon. In my mind this mostly goes for traditional style games, but I'm sure one could find some rather proge games with the same boilerplate, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470850/#Comment_470850" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-20T21:42:54+00:00" title="March 20, 2018  9:42PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, I now can put words on this.

The fact that you have some measures in place to prevent injury/trauma means that you can actually hold back less once you're comfortable and familiar with the tools you're using.<br/><br/>For example, if your group became comfortable with the kind of "Always Ask" system I describe in the Part 2 link of the original post, then you might find yourselves asking about things you'd normally hesitate to propose, confident that each other would say "no" if the proposal pushed beyond the range of fun discomfort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470868/#Comment_470868" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-21T05:55:27+00:00" title="March 21, 2018  5:55AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm personally big on talking it out instead of using safety devices in my own play, but I also feel like the text of an emotionally-challenging and potentially painful game should discuss safety devices and the like, to foster an environment of "This is how we do things in this game. We support each other and treat each other well."<br/>Which, with the fact that a lot of groups don't necessarily do this, and you have a lot of dysfunctional groups out and about, a game telling you that supporting each other is a part of how the game is played is honestly this extremely refreshing breath of air. <br/>Also, I feel like it would likely be helpful to groups that haven't really had scenarios come up where they needed to think about that sort of thing before, as they get into games where it's important to be mindful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470872/#Comment_470872" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-21T09:45:33+00:00" title="March 21, 2018  9:45AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2018 9:49AM by DeReel.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The boxing image was exactly what I had in mind, specifically with a case of punching on an old wound. See, until now, I wanted the game to "hold" as far as possible against bad faith. The following technique, while not explicitly mentioned, is purposefully not forbidden in my game : "(...) use the question-answer system as a tactical tool to drive the game not just towards your preferred tone, but towards your intended outcome for your character. This is playing unfaithfully." And character onwership is as of now the only boundary that triggers a petition for consent. Because it's traditional.<br/><br/>I see how always asking can solve a big part of possible problems. I believe the corresponding technique from LARP is "slower" "brake" or, the one I prefer "step back, breathe, look around " triggered by incoming sensistive material. Notice how I didn't mention anything about asking for consent. I don't value consent much. What I aim at is creating the material conditions that will make a change of course possible. (Now I'm getting all political...)<br/><br/>It's not a distinction between LARP or table top. Talking it out fits naturally in a game where you discuss what will happen next. Not so much in a game where every word uttered is directly true in the fiction. In this case, always asking is costly.<br/><br/>I am left with a question : what is sensitive material ? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">physical or psychological harm</span>, excrements, reproduction, nudity, profanity, ancestors, religion<br/>It feels like there won't be much time to play...<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470873/#Comment_470873" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-21T12:06:58+00:00" title="March 21, 2018 12:06PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a couple ways to edit content at the table:<br/><br/>1. Do it before play (lines and veils discussions).<br/>2. Do it during play, right before it happens (X-card or a verbal "stop").<br/>3. Do it during play, after it happens (discussion).<br/><br/>All of these are great tools and a group should employ any and all safety tools they have at their disposal to make their gamer friends feel comfortable and included. <br/><br/>The risk of doing it all before is that it requires discussion. People don't always want to discuss their issues in detail. Saying "no child molestation scenes" says a lot about a person's history and they might not want to share that. It takes a certain amount of safety at the table to be able to express things.<br/><br/>Doing it (only) after takes a huge safety net and a lot of trust, and you're basically setting yourself up for pain at the table. Most people don't want that.<br/><br/>Doing the editing during play has the benefit of being able to deal with actual issues, not theoretical issues. You're not saying, "I don't want clowns in our game," when it's really unlikely that clowns will feature in your dungeon crawl. You're saying, at the moment it comes up, "I don't want killing orc babies in our game," because someone just talked about killing the orc babies.<br/><br/>The X-card adds a safety layer to that. It makes the act of editing out content as quick and unobtrusive as possible, so people can do it and move on. No discussion required. <br/><br/>Not talking about it at all is the default for a lot of groups. The default works for people with default problems, like you and me. It fails to work for people who are more at risk. A lot of people do not want to work it out at the table, or feel unsafe to work it out at the table. <br/><br/>A person who was raped probably doesn't want to stop play and have a discussion with people about why X in the scene makes them feel sad or unsafe, especially because the other people don't <i>already get</i> why that content is unsafe for them.<br/><br/>A person who is gay or transgender but not "out" doesn't want to explain why they don't want a bunch of cis people tromping all over that subject.<br/><br/>Heck, you might not want to talk about why giant spiders freak you out, or why stories about dead grandmothers makes you incredibly sad, or why the inclusion of cigarettes makes you irrationally angry. It's a game, and you shouldn't have to explain that stuff at the table if you don't feel like it.<br/><br/><b>DeReel</b>, I'm gonna respond directly to your last comment, "It feels like there won't be much time to play..."<br/><br/>I say this with love, but honestly, if you can't find a set of content for your games that is safe for everyone at the table, then maybe that group shouldn't be playing. And if you feel that your game-fun is more important than someone's earnest request to keep something out of a game, you should re-examine your priorities.<br/><br/>In practice, having used the X-card and lines + veils discussions in games for years, there's always plenty of fruitful content for whatever game we're playing. No one abuses the tools. There are never any issues, except for people like you and me who don't apparently have many hang-ups at the table and want to nitpick the theoreticals to death. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470875/#Comment_470875" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-21T14:44:49+00:00" title="March 21, 2018  2:44PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2018 3:02PM by DeReel.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am valuing my game fun over an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">absence</span> of request right now, which is a valid set of priorities.<br/>Contrasting this with what <a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> has read in my message, I think there is a misunderstanding at work here.

How do the players know when they have to ask ?<br/>If it means you always ask before : rape and torture, the rule is of little practical use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470888/#Comment_470888" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-21T19:16:49+00:00" title="March 21, 2018  7:16PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking about this a lot since playing with a variety of strangers at a convention over the weekend. <br/><br/>I know this is a slight derail of the discussion happening, but I feel it's related:<br/><br/>I really think one of the best things we can do for safety at the table is to encourage and use <i>positive reinforcement</i>, instead of relying only on "Cut!" and the X-card.<br/><br/>I played with people who always made a point of indicating when they enjoyed something and wanted more of it, and it made gaming with them <i>so easy and fun</i>. For instance, in one game, a stranger was playing a character of a persecuted race. I made a character who was responsible for the murder of her sister (and general atrocities committed against that race of people). <br/><br/>This worried me; I was trying to fit into a fictional universe I was unfamiliar with and to contribute some exciting drama to the game, but I didn't want to antagonize or upset a stranger. She looked angry and upset, playing her character's hatred of mine, which was scary to me, since I wasn't 100% sure whether it was entirely in-character or not, and was tempted to pause the game and check in with her.<br/><br/>However, we had a little piece of paper on the table called a "Support Flower". As she played out her character's hatred for mine, she kept putting her finger on "Yes! Keep going!".<br/><br/>It was a lovely way to communicate that she was still enjoying herself, and felt like a warm hug. <br/><br/>In that environment (we all joined in, fairly quickly!), it would be quickly obvious when there was a chance someone wasn't enjoying themselves (a lack of positive reinforcement), and that would allow us to easily "spot" moments when it might make sense to "ask" or "check in" with each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470890/#Comment_470890" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-21T19:56:46+00:00" title="March 21, 2018  7:56PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2018 8:06PM by DeReel.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you Paul_T.

One of the reasons "Always Ask" is a good fit for Stand in Defiance is because the game is centered around what players and characters want and how they feel about things; pausing to ask each other how we feel helps start that conversation and emphasize that priority. It's necessary, in fact, to balance the speed of play with deliberation. This isn't all games. For a fiction-centric, "everything you say is something that happens" game, I think the X-card or a similar safe word system is a better tool.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I am left with a question : what is sensitive material ? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">physical or psychological harm</span>, excrements, reproduction, nudity, profanity, ancestors, religion<br/>It feels like there won't be much time to play...</p></div></blockquote>\nThat's a conversation that every group's going to have to have for themselves at the start of the game.

Punching monsters, cool; wondering if you're punching the monster because it reminds you of your mom, <i>not cool</i>. And when I looked back at our character generation work, I realized that we'd been talking right past each other and making false assumptions about what the other one meant.

The model in itself is very similar to <a href="http://sexedquestions.tumblr.com/post/28708253976/the-bdsm-color-system" rel="nofollow">the traffic light system</a> in BDSM, which use models of consent and communication that, honestly, I wished more social contexts could use. <br/><br/>Yes, it's good to be able to talk things out, and be able to articulate your needs before, during and after play, but honestly speaking? Sometimes people aren't good at it. And consent can shift. And while we can say that more talking is good and clear communication is a must, that's not something that everyone can do on demand, and to assume otherwise is a privilege.

I mean, normally when people are not playing roles you can interpret their behaviour and maybe see that something's wrong, or when they say "I don't like this" you might see that they're serious about it.<br/><br/>The problem with playing is that the whole point is to dilute what's real and not. But as long as there is a way to make sure the safe-word communication is under no circumstance misunderstood, then you should be alright. Right?<br/><br/>Also the deal with safe environments is that in larps people can leave the fiction and go somewhere else (the off-tent or whatever it's called) when they need to take a break - in tabletop you might not be able to walk away (if you're in someone else's apartment for example). That's why the table has to be safe to begin with and the Safe-word instead removes the fiction from the table. But, if the table is not a safe environment as you do not trust the people you play with, the Safe-word won't work. Because even when the fiction is gone you're still not safe.<br/><br/>So I see discussion as a necessary complement to Safe-words in tabletop play. And that discussion can take place either before, during, or after the activity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471132/#Comment_471132" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-26T13:55:55+00:00" title="March 26, 2018  1:55PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, generalizing and spreading the idea that players' personal comfort level is a Thing, and that not all players are equally at risk of being marginalized, is the important thing. As this thread has pointed out, there are different ways of going about handling this issue, depending on the situation, and there's no one right way to answer things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
