I have toyed with a variety of methods, but lately, I've found that given the frequently-unexpected nature of my gaming sessions, having something instant and on-hand is vastly preferrable to setting up a home stereo solution.<br/><br/>Currently, my favorite two methods for ease of use at the gaming table are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yak_Bak" rel="nofollow">Yak Bak</a> (a nifty personal sound effect recording pocket toy) and my Nintendo DS Lite, for which I have a wonderful <a href="http://www.r4ds-ds.com/" rel="nofollow">R4DS</a> homebrew modchip card.  The last time I used them was in a Star Wars game.  I wanted to be able to replicate the heavy breathing of Darth Vader and the sounds of blaster fire and clashing lightsabres at the drop of a hat, and using the Yak Bak made that very effective.<br/><br/>The DS card has a wonderful media utility called Moonshell, which essentially functions for me as an extended Yak Bak, with a wider range of mp3 music and effects available - perfect for when you need to queue up the Imperial march or the Binary Suns theme, stat.<br/><br/><br/>What are your own techniques for incorporating music and sound "on-the-fly" into your games, in an easily controllable manner?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199009/#Comment_199009" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T21:59:07+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  9:59PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use an ipod stereo.

When a character does or says something dramatic, everyone shifts into the perfect mood, and then the right little notes are played on the speakers and everyone looks at me and nods, it's perfect.<br/><br/>My biggest issue has never been volume, but timing.  I'll have musical cues planned in advance, but launching the effects and cues at the right time can be tricky.  I've found that the R4DS and Yak Bak I mentioned above are perfect for those quick one-to-three-hit cues, but lack effectiveness for assembling proper constant atmospherics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199096/#Comment_199096" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T10:08:35+00:00" title="March 27, 2009 10:08AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2009 10:10AM by David Artman.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those wanting a laptop solution but find the music search and fiddling distracting, take advantage of a little-know aspect of HTML: it can do a <i>file:///</i> call. So you make an HTML page which is all links to your MP3s, using this syntax:<br/><code>&lt;a href="file:///C:/Music/blaster.mp3&gt;Play blaster effect&lt;/a&gt;</code><br/>(Obviously, you'll have to change the file path and name to suit your actual file locations and names, for each link.)<br/><br/>Then, for example, you can get really jiggy by grouping links by type (SFX, ambient music, surprise hits) in a table format, or using icons or images instead of text for the link trigger (i.e. the stuff between the A tags), or whatever you can imagine using HTML. Advanced students can code individual effects to be fired when a specific key is pressed, but that takes some JavaScript....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199114/#Comment_199114" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T11:07:06+00:00" title="March 27, 2009 11:07AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David Artman, you are a prince among ordinary schmucks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199124/#Comment_199124" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T11:36:14+00:00" title="March 27, 2009 11:36AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um... thanks?

I posted a good starter piece of this information over in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8856" rel="nofollow">A Soundtrack for Lacuna</a> thread but I am re-posting and re-hashing here as this thread has a less specific focus<br/><br/>I find music to be a huge part of my game experience. Having background music was something I began doing years ago, when I ran some of my first Vampire games as a teenager. As my musical tastes changed, so did the way I incorporated music into my games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: NPC</cite>Currently, my favorite two methods for ease of use at the gaming table are the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yak_Bak" rel="nofollow">Yak Bak</a> (a nifty personal sound effect recording pocket toy) and my Nintendo DS Lite, for which I have a wonderful R4DS homebrew modchip card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>For those wanting a laptop solution but find the music search and fiddling distracting, take advantage of a little-know aspect of HTML: it can do a<i>file:///</i>call.</blockquote>\nI am fascinated that although there really isn't anything available, people are <em>creating</em> ways to incorporate music into their games. I see a need, but don't yet see enough demand to have something commercially available... although some are trying:\n<ul><li><a href="http://www.rpgsoundmixer.com/" rel="nofollow">RPG Sound Mixer</a> - Commercial Product</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.rpgaudiomixer.com/" rel="nofollow">RPG Audio Mixer</a> - Open Source</li></ul>\nI've done a lot of searching and brainstorming for ways that I can create a live soundtrack for my games. I love how NPC words it:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: NPC</cite>... assembling proper constant atmospherics.</blockquote>\nBut it seems everyone is coming up against similar problems: gimmicky; too difficult to control; volume problems; gets repetitive quickly. I don't claim to have <i>the</i> answer, but here is what has worked for me and how it (appears) to overcome some of the aforementioned issues. I will say that I do not use sound <em>effects</em>, only sound <em>tracks</em>, as the time investment during a game would be too great.<br/><br/><strong>The Setup:</strong> I GM from my laptop and use Winamp Lite with a few different plugins: a crossfader, a volume normalizer, and a toolbar controller. I plug in speakers that sit on the floor, beside the table, so they aren't in anyone's eye or ear-shot. I have multiple playlists which are numbered based on Action, Tension, and Mood. For example: 313 would be High Action, No Tension, Happy; whereas 231 would be Medium Action, Haunting (Tension), Sad. This is the most time consuming part, I admit that, but as a lover of music, I have no problem sitting down for an hour, listening to music, and rating different pieces. If all the music is already on your computer it's simply a matter of dragging the files to the appropriate folder and creating a playlist from that.<br/><br/><strong>Game Dynamics:</strong> Throughout the game I keep a lookout for changes in Action, Tension, and Mood (track characteristics above) and choose the playlist accordingly. I use the cross-fader plugin to transition between each (random) track on the playlist; it also transitions when I select a different playlist or skip a track in the current playlist, covering my tracks with sound as I make musical decision. The toolbar plugin let's me change the playlist in 2 mouse clicks (which could be assigned to hot keys if one were so inclined). The normalizer plugin helps to keep the music at a constant level; that is, even if the music changes in tempo, or style, it will never go above or below a certain level. You can increase your master volume, however, to accentuate specific pieces<br/><br/><strong>The Music:</strong> I know everyone has different tastes for music, but here are a few things I always keep in mind, followed by some of my music choices.\n<ul><li>No lyrics - It is simply too distracting to have another voice overshadow the voices at the table when voice and dialogue is central to roleplaying.</li>\n<li>Quality - Use music created by real musicians and composers. It's like using professional photography instead of clip art, it really creates the mood.</li>\n<li>Quantity - The more tracks you have in each playlist, the less repetitious it will be.</li>\n<li>Be picky - Some music just won't work, no matter how much you like it. If you can't fit a piece of music into a specific playlist either drop it entirely; cut it up in an editing program so that it fits into a specific playlist; or (if there is enough of this type of music) create another playlist. There is no sense in having one track that fits the mood perfectly fade in to another track that ruins the mood because you couldn't bring yourself to get rid of that track.</li>\n<li>Theme - Some tracks work in any game, other only in specific games. With the right tracks and the right ear you can score for a specifc session, mood, or game. Also, espesically for ongoing games, it can be quite evocative to have a theme song that opens and closes each session.</li></ul>\nHere are some of my music choices:\n<ul><li>Film: Cliff Martinez (Solaris, Traffic), Thomas Newman (American Beauty, Road to Perdition), Hans Zimmer (The Dark Knight, The Last Samurai), Alexandre Desplat (Birth, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button), Angelo Badalamenti (Lost Highway, Arlington Road)</li>\n<li>Videogames: Silent Hill, Max Payne, EVE, Homeworld</li>\n<li>Artists: Brian Eno, Philip Glass, Biosphere, Aphex Twin, Spacetime Continuum, Nine Inch Nails, Moby, Mogwai, Godspeed! You Black Emperor</li></ul>\nI hope this will be useful to some of you. Even if <em>sonance compositing</em> is not your thing, I hope it gives somebody the nudge they need to start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DVUS" title="DVUS"><img alt="DVUS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3459/3796518754_5531e4a169_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DVUS">DVUS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199547/#Comment_199547" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T15:08:54+00:00" title="March 30, 2009  3:08PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just made an HTML file to organize my sound clips and it works like a dream!

I decided to have one sound effect to signal when combat would start (a beating heart) and the players really liked it.  They'd freak out whenever it started playing, saying, "Oh, crap!  What did we do now?"  I also successfully used some creepy music to set a mood.  They met a guy that felt strange to them and they were just laughing it up, then I played the music and they started looking around, then said, "Ok, you're scaring us!"  So, yeah, I think it's a good thing to use.  I must definitely build up my collection of sound effects and music.<br/>\n<br/>\nD                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NPC" title="NPC"><img alt="NPC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://nathanaelcole.com/_pics/me/spider.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NPC">NPC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199676/#Comment_199676" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T07:51:22+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  7:51AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey DVUS, would you mind showing us a sample of your file?

It's a neat little program that generates ambient music and sound effects based on sound packs that can be customized.  So, you set a few sound effects for each track, and then a few songs for the music track, and it randomizes among those, based on variable intervals and so on.  I've toyed with it, but never had a chance to use it in game.<br/><br/>When I just want some quick background and mood music, I've been using Last.fm's <a href="http://www.last.fm/download" rel="nofollow">desktop app</a>.  I've had great success just typing in things like "fantasy ambient" or "dark ambient" and getting music that's appropriate to the game I'm playing.  It's fun to get that point where everyone at the table notices that the random song in the background works perfectly with what's going on in the game.  Oh, and all their music is all volume normalized, so there's rarely unexpected jumps in volume either.  Sadly, however, Last.fm is about to start forcing paid subscriptions for any users outside the US, UK, or Germany, and I've yet to decide if their service is worth paying for.<br/><br/>Oh, and speaking of volume normalization, I've personally run my entire mp3 collection through a program called MP3Gain, which does volume normalization based on the apparent volume of the song.  It gets all the music to more or less the same level without screwing with the relative levels within each file, but on listening you end up with songs that are all around the same volume level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DVUS" title="DVUS"><img alt="DVUS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3459/3796518754_5531e4a169_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DVUS">DVUS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199812/#Comment_199812" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T17:09:14+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  5:09PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I customize all my sound effect/music files, so I don't have problems with the volume.

I took a screenshot of it displayed.  I don't have a lot of sounds yet, but the table worked out great to organize.  I have a column for common sounds (things I think I'll use multiple times in a game session), then one for war, horror... and I'll get more headings as I get more sound effects.  I put the music in it's own heading, since I will have much less music than sound effects.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="3402358249_0f66957427.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3638/3402358249_0f66957427.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\nD                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199928/#Comment_199928" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T09:25:01+00:00" title="April  1, 2009  9:25AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While we're on the subject of file calls, don't forget that you can do calls to your music player application, with the appropriate command line parameters to send it the song/SFX title AND tell it to loop AND set volume, etc. Check this, as an example:<br><a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/commandline.html" rel="nofollow">MPlayer command line controls</a><br><br>So those <b>file:///</b> calls could also handle looping (or, with MPlayer, nested looping!), feeding a whole playlist at once, or whatever it supports as command line arguments.
