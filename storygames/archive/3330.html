Even if you get everybody on board and enthusiastic for "being more descriptive of stuff," that does not mean that the players will then leap into describing everything in appropriate levels of detail or making those details interesting to the other players.  In fact, I would suggest that <em>most of the time</em> the "big talk" is most effectively followed by <em>reliable exercises</em> that guide the players in practicing the new skill or habit.  Talking is going to get everybody on the same page of "this is what we're going to do."  All the talking in the world will not get everybody on the same page of "this is how we're going to do it."  For that, you need to actually <em>do something</em>.

I'm not questioning the discussion of techniques, but rather the way in which we judgmentally declare certain things to be "problems" which need "curing" in a group which seems to have settled into its own style of play. I've heard of a bunch of groups get turned off to story games and the like just because someone pushed a little too forcefully the idea that Something Is The Disease, And I'm The Cure.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75369/#Comment_75369" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T10:27:54+00:00" title="June 13, 2007 10:27AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Certainly I found trying to run a game of Dogs very revealing about how I could GM a game quite differently from the style I was used to.

So Josh is right, Ville is right on board with his examples.</blockquote>\nDoesn't that step came after open discussion? Because if there's no discussion, isn't that "sneaking up"?<br/><br/>By framing the question as "cures" for "symptoms," I think it's implied that someone in this picture is passing judgement. E.g., I don't see not being descriptive about your PC's sword blows as an inherently bad thing, especially if the system could care less.<br/><br/>If we frame the discussion as "List specific techniques to bring the awesome and which games do them best," then I'm all for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Discordian" title="Discordian"><img alt="Discordian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Discordian">Discordian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75441/#Comment_75441" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T12:32:09+00:00" title="June 13, 2007 12:32PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Woah.

Meanwhile, I'm getting all these magic items Y and Z, which aren't what I want to play with.<br/>Treatment: Try Donjon.  When looting monsters or searching a treasure trove, you get to declare that you're hoping magic item X is in there.  No more waiting for the GM to put it in the adventure or roll up on those random treasure tables.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75739/#Comment_75739" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T14:43:32+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  2:43PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark, "Sneaking Up" in my essay, is only changing a few select rules in an attempt to cause a change in play-style.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not against talking about these things in general terms, but I am, in fact, against implying to the other players that how they're playing currently is "wrong."

And people are suggesting that, in order to get people to try italian, they're suggesting ketchup on the hamburgers (as a prelude to red sauce). I'm suggesting that it's OK to suggest going to the Italian restaraunt to try it out. Nobody is bad or wrong here, we're just trying something else that I think and hope we might all like. Since I like Italian, and don't know anyone who doesn't like Italian.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if I come at folks and say, "You know the reason we eat hamburgers is because we've all been enculturated by the hetrogenous dictatorship of American culture" that might just put some folks off. If all the talk amounts to is, "I like Italian, wanna give it a try?" then I'm all for it.
