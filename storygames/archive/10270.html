Caesar_X had a lot of good feedback and I am incorporating that into Book 1. Book 3 (Cities and Adventure) is still just notes and somewhat usable.  Book 2 is well, a pile of paper. For those that expressed interest in the thing I'll be sending out copies as soon as I get the changes made.<br/><br/>But before all that some questions for folks.<br/><br/>There are six paths in Book 1. Horse Rider, Solider, Traveler,  Rogue, Privateer, Merchant.<br/>Instead of the Advanced Education Table each path has a specialized skill table based on a core ability (like Str, Dex, Ins, etc..)<br/><br/>For each path what would be skills and/or benefits available only to that group?<br/><br/>The Social ability doesn't get used enough. So right now I have the following rules for Social:<br/>It allow your character access to certain parts of the city <br/>If your character Social ability is high enough the Law tends to look the other way<br/>To maintain a given Social level your character has to cough up Soc x 10 in coins per month<br/><br/>What other fun things can we do with the Social ability in a S&amp;S setting?<br/><br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>ara                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon%20W" title="Simon W"><img alt="Simon W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon%20W">Simon W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228315/#Comment_228315" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T23:41:39+00:00" title="August 27, 2009 11:41PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your character gets to bed wenches that are way out of his league, normally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also love to get a playtest copy of this when you have something ready.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228386/#Comment_228386" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T10:09:26+00:00" title="August 28, 2009 10:09AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looking forward to seeing the drafts.<br/><br/>Regarding Social, you might take inspiration from Swordbearer, which used social class as a way of determining what equipment a character had access to.  For example if you are a noble, it's easy to scare up plate mail &amp; a horse, but if you are a commoner, you might need to settle for an iron cap &amp; Shank's Mare.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
