I'm going to be at two panels at Fanime in May: one is on Bliss Stage and the Bliss Stage computer game, the other is on what's happening with the CelStyle Games imprint.  <br/><br/>It looks like the Bliss Stage panel is going to be early on Friday, so keep that in mind if you want to attend...<br/><br/>I'm curious what you'd like to know.  Anything in particular you'd like us to talk about?  Any questions you'd like answered?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
