A lot of the conversations being had here at the moment require a fair amount of Story Games cultural background to understand. Trying to push those into someone else's forum would be more like an invasion. Also, Story Games as a discussion forum has a lot of issues, which periodically get examined in fits of navel-gazing but never actually fixed. Starting anew gives an opportunity to actually fix those rather than just transplanting them elsewhere.<br/><br/>I have been thinking about what the perfect software to run somewhere like this would look like - it probably doesn't exist, but here's my wish-list:<br/><br/>Inline word definitions. People complain about jargon, but it's used because it's useful. Something that links to a single source of truth that people could mouseover to get a concise definition, that looks a bit like <abbr title="thanks 2097">this</abbr> would work wonders to make the place make sense. Either something fully automated - where, say, the first use of a word in the glossary and every nth usage of it after that are marked up, or some easy tagging system (e.g. writing [GNS] would show as <abbr title="gamism/narrativism/simulationism - blahblahblah">GNS</abbr>. I think the important thing being that there's one canonical definition and not thirty.<br/><br/>Being able to split threads easily would be a good thing - I think all forum software allows mods to split threads, but it would be good if other people could. Currently there's a lot of 'if you want to talk about it, start another thread' type posts - being able to prune off posts into new threads would a) increase the amount of discussions happening, b) keep the thread on the original topic clean, and c) decrease the pace of threads so that there aren't five different topics going on at once.<br/><br/>Once upon a time, I remember there being a [Slow Down](?) tag put in the titles of threads that were moving too fast for people to catch up on or be involved in if certain prolific posters were deep in discussion. Systemising this would be nice - being able to mark a thread as Slow could add a cooldown timer for posting, maybe limit post size, and prevent double-posts. Being unable to keep up with the pace of conversations is a big turnoff from participating.<br/><br/>Getting a bit more pie-in-the-sky, but some way of automatically summarising threads and indexing them or the ideas in them for later reference would be nice. There are algorithms that can shrink articles - if there were something that could shrink threads and pop out the salient points people made without all the wading through the point/counterpoints to get there - and then if that could be automatically linked next time someone makes a similar thread as a 'what we think about this so far' ... well, that would be nice. As-is, you sometimes get someone who posts a bunch of old threads with hundreds of long thoughtful posts and that's great but often way too much (though I guess just automating the link-finding would be relatively easy - other forums already do that).<br/><br/>Maybe a way to set up a voice call discussion. I reckon if people sat down and talked for ten minutes, that would obviate the need for ten pages of back-and-forth disagreement on what they mean by a particular word, and the long text posts could be saved for the 'why this is cool' part of the discussion. Plus, for a forum about conversation-based games, it would make a lot of sense if you could play one here.<br/><br/><br/>Anyways, enough wishful thinking. I would really like there to be a successor forum to both here and The Forge though, so I'm happy to help with whatever effort gains traction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484539/#Comment_484539" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T21:41:10+00:00" title="May 28, 2019  9:41PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me personally, discord would be most appealing, but maybe with specific channels where it's encouraged that you post more like a forum, what with waiting for responses and stuff, and some channels devoted to live chat.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484540/#Comment_484540" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T22:30:50+00:00" title="May 28, 2019 10:30PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like there should be a way to have elements of discord (real time chatting, seeing who's online now, pbp) sort of embedded into a more traditional forum.

But from how I've seen moderation go down, they keep the place pretty focused on game discussion (not theory), very humanist/positive, blocking of toxic folk, and very open to small-press/hippie game discussion (their "game of the month" is basically a hit list of Story Gaming classics). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg</a><br/><br/>(there are also individual subreddits for various games, including game design.

Folks looking for forums/long term discussions might be disappointed.<br/><a href="https://dice.camp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dice.camp</a><br/><br/>* <b>Itch.io</b> (a very interesting up-and-comer) has a Tabletop Games discussion forum, even with a place to discuss Play, Theory, LARP, and sub-forums dedicated to indie classics:<br/><a href="https://itch.io/community" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://itch.io/community</a><br/><br/>Please do feel free to share more- Forums, Discord Communities, etc.<br/><br/>I also continue to urge people who have a real interest in this kind of thing, to consider starting new communities (no rush, take your time etc) or getting involved with new forum software initiatives (if they have that skillset or are interested in developing it). I'd love to see new places, new focuses, new communities of activity, new users discussing the fringe, and so on. <br/><br/><b>EDIT: </b>I'll close with a few fringe offerings.

This diagram illustrates how the different platforms communicate, and, more importantly, who can actively communicate.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://i.snap.as/K7USdZh.png"/><br/><br/>The second part of that is that a pod/instance is only as reliable as its admins.<br/><br/>I have an account on several different pods, which isn't the recommended way to go.  But my introduction was more haphazard.  I started out on Pluspora, which is a Diaspora* pod created for G+ refugees.  I had a good run there and the admins were very responsive, but wanted to communicate with people outside of the Diaspora* network, and found out about forums, which I definitely wanted to be a part of.  I also have an account on dice.camp, which is a mastodon instance.  I want to say that Vincent Baker runs that one, but don't quote me on that.  It's very lively and is geared towards TTRPG enthusiasts and such.  But as I found out, that really doesn't make a difference. <br/><br/>As everything is federated, as long as your platform can communicate with others, you can interact wth people on a variety of platforms.  There are limitations in the implementations of the protocols across platform, though they are always working on them, it seems.<br/><br/>I decided on Friendi.ca because of the fact that it could communicate with pretty much everything, was pretty user friendly (unlike my experience with Hubzilla, and had forums).  This is the part where pod reliability comes into it.<br/><br/>Most of the people that are doing this are in it for reasons other than money.  So when the instance interacts with money (real life, technical issues, etc), you can have a less than reliable experience.  For Friendi.ca, I chose rpgtable.top.  I wanted to support an effort rather than striking out on my own, and that one was geared towards TTRPGs from the start, just as dice.camp.  It started out well but had stability problems, and the instance was down for weeks.  During that time, I rolled my own on my own server and pieced together my contacts from the little that I had available to do so.  It came back up, and I think it's more reliable (they got another admin, and I haven't seen it down), but I realized I'd rather have control of my experience, and I wasn't really missing anything by not being on a large instance.<br/><br/>That's been my experience- I'm on my instance and on dice.camp/tabletop.social (as a backup for when dice.camp is down), and am enjoying it, though it's definitely a lot different than having a centralized experience.<br/><br/>A few links:<br/><br/><a href="https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/FAQ_for_users" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/FAQ_for_users</a><br/><a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-i-wish-i-knew-before-joining-mastodon-7a17e7f12a2b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://hackernoon.com/what-i-wish-i-knew-before-joining-mastodon-7a17e7f12a2b</a><br/><a href="https://medium.com/we-distribute/the-do-everything-system-an-in-depth-review-of-hubzilla-3-0-692204177d4e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://medium.com/we-distribute/the-do-everything-system-an-in-depth-review-of-hubzilla-3-0-692204177d4e</a><br/><a href="https://medium.com/welands-smithy/teaching-and-learning-with-decentralized-social-networks-friendica-and-the-fediverse-d2a7afa831bd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://medium.com/welands-smithy/teaching-and-learning-with-decentralized-social-networks-friendica-and-the-fediverse-d2a7afa831bd</a><br/><a href="https://the-federation.info/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://the-federation.info/</a><br/><a href="https://aggronaut.com/2018/08/27/fediverse-things-i-wish-i-knew-earlier/comment-page-1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://aggronaut.com/2018/08/27/fediverse-things-i-wish-i-knew-earlier/comment-page-1/</a><br/><a href="https://howlingpixel.com/i-en/Fediverse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://howlingpixel.com/i-en/Fediverse</a><br/><a href="https://github.com/joyeusenoelle/GuideToMastodon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/joyeusenoelle/GuideToMastodon/</a><br/><a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.joinmastodon.org/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485702/#Comment_485702" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-10T17:19:26+00:00" title="June 10, 2019  5:19PM">June 10</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\u2019ve never used these formats before (like Mastodon).

It's a bit better for longer discussions as you can trace your way back to the conversation easier in my experience.  But it's still Twitter, microblogging, and all that implies.<br/><br/>Diaspora* is a bit better.  The downsides that made me start looking elsewhere were the lack of forums and the lack of an ability to edit posts (delete and republish!  Mastodon has that limitation also).  It does have the ability to follow bare tags in your stream.  So if you followed <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23ttrpgs&amp;Mode=like">#ttrpgs</a>, anything tagged with that would show up in your stream.  But also, <i>anything </i>that was tagged with that would show up in your stream.<br/><br/>Friendica has Forums, though they are a bit challenging when compared to your traditional forum.  There's a certain format that people have to follow to publish to them.  And they have no index, so just like things can scroll off here at times if they aren't touched... Friendica has it even worse, so if something goes cold, it will be hard to find it.  You can't follow hashtags, though you can save the searches.  Friendica also has the ability to bookmark and organize threads, so even though there's not a real easy way to get back to old stuff, you can bookmark it to make sure it remains close.<br/><br/>I know that one person that I follow is developing a game on it in his private posts.  That MementoRPG forum that you see is in the screenshot above is a forum that I created for playtesting my game.<br/><br/>None of them a perfectly equivalent, but I prefer the engagement and conversations on Friendica.  (I didn't really <i>figure out</i> Hubzilla enough to engage with people on the platform)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
