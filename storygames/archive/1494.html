                    Somebody who groks Bangs (in Sorcerer and elsewhere) help me out, here.<br/><br/>A Bang is a situation which requires the player to make a thematically significant decision.<br/>The GM prepares Bangs out of player Kicker/Flags.<br/>The GM then gets the characters to the Bangs and lets the players make their decisions.<br/><br/>Now, the whole point of the Bang is to let the players make their big important decisions without GM interference, and that I get.  But doesn't the GM have to employ a little or a lot of Force to get the players to the Bang in the first place?  Is this just an acceptable amount of GM Force?  Is this one of those Indie 1.0 things, where Sorcerer, state of the art at its time, was three steps away from Illusionism, and now from my vaulted position of five steps away I'm looking back and wondering why the decade-old game is back there?                </div>

                            Isn't the key difference that bangs give the player a meaningful choice, while illusionism is about guiding the player to a predetermined choice?<br/><br/>If I bang, I don't know what will happen next.

                            Joshua,<br/><br/>I'd guess that it's probably going to differ based on specific Bang techniques employed, but...  The way I use them, which I learned from Mike Holmes, is to simply have a big list for each character.  I look at the characters, I look at the game in general, and I try to figure out what thematic buttons I want to push.  Then I make up a big list of stuff that could happen to that character that pushes those buttons.<br/><br/>The power of Bangs is, in my eyes, that they are prepped.  You can improvise awesome choice-forcing stuff of course, but by prepping the Bangs between sessions you can edit them and hone them and make them as awesome as possible.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

I think Bangs might be a more subtle concept than you're thinking it is.  I've played Dogs with you.  You use Bangs as Sorcerer intends.  Some dude falls half dead out of a second story window at my feet?  That's a bang.  Oh his wife did it because he was with another woman?  That's another bang.  Crap, there's some woman in town setting up arranged marriages.  That's yet another Bang.<br/>
<br/>
Note: These are "clue" bangs and see how they're very very different from Call of Cthulhu style: "Best check out the manner house at 1221 Miskatonic Avenue!" type clues.<br/>
<br/>
I think you might be confusing Bangs with really agressive Scene Framing.  Really agressive Scene Framing *can* be (doesn't have to be) a form of GM Force.   I can use Scene Framing techniques to reduce the number relevant choices you have within the scene or worse to indirectly imply significant decisions your character must have made in between scenes.<br/>

                            Framing, Force, and Illusionism are some of those gray-areas in the theory-language that lead to misunderstandings. A lot of how a person will evaluate illusionism will be based on their expectation of input. If I expect no force whatsoever to act on me during the game (I am the only moving part) then having the evil baron show up on my doorstep demanding a duel (even if I can decline it) may be seen as "force" ("I could decline it ... but look like a coward! How could you do that to me!?").<br/><br/>Of course for most systems and most players this isn't a realistic example or a realistic expectation--which is why I think bangs don't count as illusionism in any reasonable way. <br/><br/>Firstly, there is no "illusion" involved (neither with framing). Secondly, there is no Force (for any reasonable definition of Force) involved in the *solution*.<br/><br/>Secondly, the GM is simply "posing the question." I think the GM "gets to pose the question" in most games (certainly all traditional ones I can think of).<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

                            Actually, Josh, I think you're hitting the cognitive nail on the head for me.  Bangs were one of the non-starters for me in Sorcerer, because in illusionist play  that's pretty much what I'd always done: given my players the illusion that they had a choice until the moment where what would be termed a "Bang" came up.  But it takes a bit of cat herding to drive players to the point where they decide between hitting a defenseless woman in the face with a sledgehammer and doing their own damn legwork.  If it's not a choice, then the results aren't anything like as profound.<br/><br/>But, and here's the point that seems to be missed, to get them there you do need to do quite a bit of steering.  Unless, as Ben suggests, you just go around banging your players.  Er, rather, their characters, right?  For that, though, it seems like you'd need really vaguely hashed out bangs in order to drop them whenever they come up.  Which almost seems like it'd be more reasonable to just improvise.                        </div>

                            Joshua,<br/><br/>That's a specific implementation question, and a good one.  I've used various implementations to solve that problem, all of them have been pretty interesting.  You can use any of these by themselves, or in combinations.<br/><br/>1. Don't be so specific.  Instead of my Bang being 'Bob's sister is going to be sacrificed to the harvest god', I'll use something like 'Bob's sister is going to be sacrificed (something related to religion or the community)'.  This way it's easier to slot my Bang into whatever situation is going on.<br/><br/>2. Have a lot of Bangs.  A whole lot of them.  If you have enough the players are bound to run into some of them.  (I don't do things this way much these days, but it worked okay when I did.)<br/><br/>3. Remember that NPCs are proactive too.  Your Bang is that Bob's sister is going to be sacrificed?  Well then his mother may well hunt him down to beg him to go save his sister.  You don't have to get Bob to the altar for the decision to be powerful, he may not even go.  Rather than bringing the players to the Bang, you bring the Bang to the players.<br/><br/>Cross-posted with Nathan, Jesse, Marco, <i>and</i> Judson.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Nathan, destabilizing events I can grok.  But you can't plan those, can you?  That's where my disconnect occurs.<br/><br/>Jesse, when I ran Dogs for you, I opened the game with you coming down the road into town with a farmhouse looming above you.  Then the guy came crashing out of the window.  But I couldn't have the guy come out of the window without having used at least a little bit of Force in that scene-frame.  Otherwise, he goes crashing out the window and you're, you know, not there.  I liked the results and all, so really, I'm nitpicking the finer points here to understand how it ticks.  Why wasn't that scene frame to put you in the right place Force on my part?<br/><br/>Marco, I think you and I are working along the same lines.  There seems to be a sort of acceptable level of GM Force, which differs from game to game (as in, my Sorcerer may require more or less than your Sorcerer which may require more or less than Judson's TSOY, etc).  There's also some touchy territory concerning over which decisions the GM can use Force -- the GM may plan a bang for a player who's actually more interested in some element of the lead-up to the bang.  If the GM tromps on what is for the player a thematically significant decision, even if the GM is unaware or has simply misjudged the player's interest, then there is some level of transgression on the part of the GM.<br/><br/>Judson, we've talked along these lines before.  I'm open to the possibility that I'm either not seeing something or my conception of bang is slightly skewed.  Nathan and Ben's bangs, for instance, sound like a different but related concept to what I seem to remember reading in Sorcerer.  Which is why one of my suspicions is that it's a first-generation indie thing that has since been elaborated and improved upon.                        </div>

                            I think people are right about talking about bangs as something which the player is not guided to, but is instead dropped on the player when and only when it's applicable.  But I also want to talk about my understanding of illusionism here as well.<br/><br/>For me, illusionism is guiding or forcing a player to a point that looks like a choice, but in fact isn't.  It is distinct from a bang in that a bang "expects" the story to branch from there afterwards dependent on which choice is made, while illusionism says, here's a choice, but secretly, all of the things you might choose lead to the same outcome and it is therefore no choice at all.

                            Fred, I get that, and I think that bangs as specific instances where the GM lets go and the players do their thing and the game progresses is a very good thing to hammer into heads.  I think the concept of the bang has improved game design.  Et cetera.<br/><br/>What I'm getting at is that first arrow between the pawn and the starburst in the third illustration.  Between the 'g' and the 'n' of Progression, decisions are being made and roles, they are being played.  And it seems to me that there's some GM Force being applied in there, getting the player to the starburst.<br/><br/>It's like a scope of inquiry thing, where if you zoom back, bangs are an alternative to illusionism for the reasons you cite.  But zooming in, there is space between bangs, and those spaces seem to require some GM Force to operate.  Or else I'm missing something, which is entirely possible.                        </div>

<br/>
If we're talking pure Forge defenition, Force is the act of the GM removing *relevant* choices from the players, not removing ANY choices from the players.  Relevant is highly specific from game to game.  In our Dogs game there was nothing for me, the player to do, before you put me on that street.  There was no reason for me to go, "Hey wait a minute, but I want to be in the inn shining my boots!"  Where I started the game wasn't relevant.<br/>
<br/>
Now if Dogs were a tactical western game then sure, I might be kind of miffed that you had me walking down the street.  I mean whether I'm on horse back or nor or whether I'm coming down the main road or from a less traveled angle is HIGHLY relevant and damn well it would have been Force.<br/>

                            Ack!  Thomas said something and I cross-posted and didn't notice!
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thomas Robertson</cite>1. Don't be so specific.<br/>2. Have a lot of Bangs.<br/>3. Remember that NPCs are proactive too.</blockquote>Okay, I'm hearing a lot of 'don't be specific' and 'don't really plan too much' sort of responses, so perhaps I've been making bangs into a much more concrete sort of plan than they are intended to be.  Thomas' scatter-shot have-lots-of-bangs strategy, where each bang is sort of loosely defined (and therefore less work) seems to support that, as well.  So can I get some chatter from the rest of the folks?  Are bangs just not as specific as I've been making them?<br/><br/>The <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> gets me, though, because this seems to me to be supporting the GM-uses-a-little-Force thing.  The NPCs are proactive, too, and they massively outnumber the PCs, so the GM can arrange the pieces on the board, so to speak, to get the players to the next bang.<br/><br/>Now, sidestep time to personal view of reality and such.  To me, a decision is entirely determined by its context.  Which is why I love Dogs: it takes any number of "black-and-white" decisions (don't shoot your grandmother) and then puts human, hurting faces on the participants and suddenly the decision isn't so simple any more.  It's all about the context.  So in large part, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> sounds to me like it's putting the GM in control of the context, and therefore in control of the decision.  When I run Dogs, I'm very damn careful to leave some ambiguity to the NPCs and their motivations so that players have some room.  I could see running Dogs where I don't leave that ambiguity, and I think it would kill the game.  That little dance where I let myself complicate things but not be too didactic about it, that's me using judicious Force.                        </div>

What you're missing is that the third diagram cannot be considered without the context of the fourth.  There's no GM vector being applied on the arrow in the third diagram prior to the existence of the starburst.  The arrow would bend (as it does in diagram #2) if the GM was doing something to it, right?  Instead, the GM is observing the arrow as the player's momentum.  It's happening, whether the GM's involved or not.  Given that this is occurring, the GM then says "Ah! I have a bang that occurs along that already-determined path.  Let's drop it in there."<br/><br/>This is <i>massively different</i> from an illusionist saying, okay, they're headed in this direction, but I'll tweak it so they're actually heading in this <i>other</i> direction, and now they'll hit this thing I've bent them to run into.<br/><br/>So it's really the comparison between diagrams <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> for me.  In the illusionverse, the lines are bent, because the illusory choices are in fact gravity wells that pull the player's trajectory in.  In the bangverse, the bangs aren't gravity wells.  They're things you intersect with, or you don't.  And when you intersect with them, you're presented with the choice to change your trajectory.  But it's only <i>choice</i> that's changing the course -- not gravity.                        </div>

                            Hi Joshua,<br/>
<br/>
I think you're confounding Force with any sort of interesting GM input, or more accurately, scene-framing or role-playing input from someone who doesn't have a player-character.<br/>
<br/>
Force = someone who doesn't play Mary (a player-character) reaching over and making a key decision for Mary, co-opting that job from Mary's player.<br/>
<br/>
It can be done very clearly and obviously - "Mary thinks this and does that." It can be done relatively subtly - "The sword flies from the villain's hand and lands at Mary's feet!"<br/>
<br/>
Because elements of scene framing, for instance, <i>can</i> be utilized as Force, does not mean that Force is being utilized every time a GM frames a scene. Similarly, because NPC comment and direction <i>can</i> be utilized as Force, does not mean that Force is being utilized every time a GM provides NPC input or action which affects a player-character. I run into this a lot - for fear of being a railroader, a GM finds himself paralyzed from doing anything.<br/>
<br/>
Asking "how is a Bang not illusionist?", is like asking "How is a cat not a duck?" By definition a Bang cannot exert Force; it can only provide opportunities for actions and decisions, with control and choice over those actions and decisions being placed in the hands of the other person.<br/>
<br/>
You also seem a bit boggled by the idea of preparing Bangs. I'm not sure why. Nothing about preparing a Bang means that it must be used (hence no need to push a PC into it), and nothing about preparing a Bang means that you're dictating what the player does in response (hence no Force). And if you <i>do</i> deliver that Bang, nothing about introducing its elements into play necessarily means using Force.<br/>
<br/>
... ah, fuck it. Look - post in Actual Play. Describe a real instance of GM and player interaction which you think is relevant to this question. All will then be easily discussed and no confusion will be possible.<br/>
<br/>
Best, Ron                        </div>

                            Fred,<br><br>This is exactly the missed communication I'm talking about.  My experience with anything like a bang was that there was some of the illusory choice happening in order to lead up to the bangs that had no plan after them.  The image I have is of a railroad reaching the end of the line, and the cabbie asking "where to?"  I consider this a hybrid of the either/or relationship proponed in this discussion and neatly illustrated by your diagram.<br><br>My intuition is this: the universe of possible story is infinite, on a transfinite order at least with the real numbers, and possibly up there with all possible curves.  Bangs are necessarily finite regions within that universe, and if the paths of the characters are going to intersect those fields, there has to be some guidance.  To a limited degree, Kickers provide that in <cite>Sorcerer,</cite> by designating a start point, and a wise GM structures his bangs in a shell around the kicker.  <br><br>But other legitimate alternatives include guiding the path of the characters to bangs, but not afterwards, or improvising bangs in the path of the characters.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

The GM using their input to guide a game in a productive fashion isn't Illusionism - it's what the GM does in that game.

                            Jesse, who decides what's a relevant choice?  It seems to me that the bang-structured game is perhaps not the GM deciding what is the right answer, but the GM is deciding what the right question is.<br><br>Fred, I get what you're getting at, but... I don't buy that the GM is really that hands-off between bangs.  Does the GM not actually <em>speak</em>?  Does the GM not introduce new fictional events and details that might change the players' course of action?  I have trouble buying that the GM is even capable of not influencing inter-bang travel, as it were.  Or -- and maybe this is a missing part of it -- is the bang-structure dependent on player buy-in that, once they decide on a course of action, they ramp it up to the max until they hit something?  So the GM throws stuff out there and the players dig on it cause it's foreshadowing the mystery thing that they know that they're going to smash into?                        </br></br></div>

                            Josh,<br><br>A certain amount of "force" is acceptable. Forge-type narrativist games employ force all the time, as you have observed. But the idea of "relevent choice" is very important here. The GM is (usually) allowed to skip the players over the "boring stuff" and get straight to the action of bangs.<br><br>Also iago's (Fred?) post is spot on---the difference between Illusionism and "good" force is that the illusionist GM is guiding the players around a predetermined plot, while the "good" force/bang GM is adjusting the course of the narrative according to player choice.<br/><br/>[edit] Also, there's no doubt that the bang GM is a powerful force in the direction of the game. In the "bass playing " GM style Ron likes to talk about, the GM's role is to recognize the thematic direction the players are moving in and present situations along those lines. It is an inherently reactive style. But it still comes with a whole lot of influence. I don't think anyone would disagree. [/edit]                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            The answer is - in practice, shittily-chosen and/or crappily-presented Bangs are approximately the same as shittily-presented and crappily-designed Illusionism. Since I don't think Illusionism is always bad (it's the same thing as Participationism and that's exactly what my group wants) and I don't think Bangs are always good (good pacing is hard to figure out), I don't see any problem at all in equating the two. <br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Fred, I get what you're getting at, but... I don't buy that the GM is really that hands-off between bangs.  Does the GM not actually<em>speak</em>?  Does the GM not introduce new fictional events and details that might change the players' course of action?  I have trouble buying that the GM is even capable of not influencing inter-bang travel, as it were.  Or -- and maybe this is a missing part of it -- is the bang-structure dependent on player buy-in that, once they decide on a course of action, they ramp it up to the max until they hit something?  So the GM throws stuff out there and the players dig on it cause it's foreshadowing the mystery thing that they know that they're going to smash into?</blockquote>
Well, here, you're conflating "GM speaking" with "GM force", right?  Is it your experience that every sentence a GM speaks, whether bangs are at play or not, constitutes a force?  I think this is at the crux of the trouble you're expressing with bangs.  And as to any of the rest of this, I gotta point at Ron's earlier post and leave it at that.                        </div>

                            Ron, I'll post over at the Forge shortly, but I think you're underestimating my facility for confusion. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Nathan, to elaborate a bit, I don't think there's a very distinct line between GM Force, GM Influence, and GM Participation.  It's one of those things where no matter what you do, it has an affect on the fiction and the other players.  Now, you can do things intentionally with an eye towards the effects, or you can do things unintentionally (at which point your superego, cultural heritage, and unspoken assumptions start influencing those effects).  Especially when you're dealing with second-guess-the-GM players, but I think applying to all players everywhere, there's a sort of groping towards shared mindspace that's happening.  (Which is awesome.)  So what the GM does may be no different than what any other player does, but the rest of the table will listen, digest, and act accordingly.  So when the GM says to herself, "Man, it'd be cool if the Baron was waiting in the treasury when they get there," and so moves those proactive NPCs or otherwise contributes to the ongoing story, how is that not GM Force?                        </div>

My very quick, not overthought answer is: Because that does not take away a relevant, meaningful choice from the player.  It just creates a situation of tension.<br/><br/>Edit: Er, THE PLAYER, not the GM.  Bad Fingers!                        </div>

<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21694.0" rel="nofollow">Actual Play post</a>, Ron.<br/><br/>Fred, it seems to me to not take the relevant, meaningful choice away from the player <em>as long as</em> the player is exclusively in Actor Stance.<br/><br/>We had some trouble with this recently in PTA, where one of our players really struggled with cramming his creative roleplaying mind back into Actor Stance after playing so many games that afforded him much more leeway in determining what happened around his character.  He wanted to narrate good portions of the context around his character -- things much like whether the Baron is in the Treasury or not.  So in PTA, the player decisions that were meaningful and relevant to how he wanted to see the game develop were the province of the Producer, and the decisions that the Producer made could very well trample over those relevant, meaningful things that he wanted.                        </div>

                            Well, I talked in the context of my experience of Sorcerer play, which has largely been actor-stanced players with a GM making story-sensitive choices about when and where to place bangs.  So my answer still stands; you didn't provide a context when you posed your question.<br/><br/>If the player's not in actor stance, and you're using a game like PTA?  Then, yeah, the player should be deciding the baron's in there.  At which point the player has provided a kicker, instead of the GM providing a bang, and I'm kinda fine with that.  If your game's supporting that sort of player input, the GM shouldn't be dictating bangs unless he has the narrative control and authority to do so, right?  Instead, the GM should say "Wouldn't it be cool if..." and then the guy with the narrative authority to do so can author a kicker (i.e., player-bang) that fits that.  Which, also, isn't a force.                        </div>

Then Qaldun says, "Look, I think we started off on the wrong foot. Can we start over? I'm Qaldun. I've heard much of your skill and ferocity in battle; I'm proud to ride with you."

                            Fred's answer is 100% correct.<br/>
<br/>
I strongly suggest saying to yourself, "I am using the word 'Force' in a way which Ron [who invented the term with some help from Mike Holmes] is not using it. Therefore we are talking about two different things."<br/>
<br/>
I GMed a not-very-successful session of Sorcerer at GenCon 2005 - a short game, not a demo. Judd was playing a near-homeless, conspiracy-nut character. My best moment that evening was responding to his announced action, "I'm going straight to the mayor and telling him this is fucked up!!", by having the mayor meet the character, reply to him with respect, and offer to hire him as city manager for all such complaints. Judd's jaw dropped. He accepted in a kind of shell-shocked way, and kept staring at me as I described his character getting steam-cleaned, shaved, and dressed in a nice suit.<br/>
<br/>
That was a Bang. I had no idea how Judd would like to play his character in response to the mayor's offer. Any response ("I strangle him!") would be OK. But this is where we all, as a group, found out whether there was a reasonable core to Judd's character, not to mention whether people were interested in learning more about this surprisingly casual/powerful mayor.<br/>
<br/>
Where's the Force? It's not there. Was there GM input? Hell yes. I popped Judd's character straight up to the mayor (framed the scene). I played the mayor as a non-trivial character in the fictional situation. I posed a direct challenge to the player-character's written concept as a homeless weirdo. I <i>did stuff</i> with this scene and with my character in it.<br/>
<br/>
But I didn't fuck with a single iota of what Judd's character wanted to do in response. I didn't even anticipate any response in the sense of having a contingency plan or any sort of "and if he does <i>this</i>, I'll do <i>that</i>" frame of mind. Hence, no Force.<br/>
<br/>
GM-input has no special name in Forge jargon. It's a contribution to the shared fiction, that's all, with or without special privileges or responsibilities depending on the game. <i>Force</i> is something highly specific, highly defined. When you ask questions like "But if I say the character is now on-board the ship, isn't that Force?", I can only shrug and say, "Did you <i>forcibly</i>, i.e. without consent, take over the player's choices in doing so?" If you didn't, then it's not Force. The cat ain't a duck.<br/>

                            Fred, I apparently wasn't clear.  In the beginning portion of a PTA scene, a scene which he didn't frame, this player was trying to narrate lots of things that the Producer "ought" to be narrating.  That's just the way that PTA works, which is fine.  But in this example, you can see how a player may want important and thematic things out of the context in which his player is situated.  In a game where the player <em>does not</em> have such narrative authority, the GM may be trampling over the things that the player wants in her attempt to get to the bang she thinks is important.  Is that GM Force, since the player wants things that he doesn't actually have the power to effect in the game?<br><br>Shreyas, oh hell yes players can offer bangs to other players.  Sure.  Which is sort of what I'm after.  The GM-structures-game-with-bangs thing seems to be a patch on a wobbly system.  Bangs in isolation as "important decision point" are gold.  It's the use of bangs as the waypoints in a structured game that's getting me all cross-eyed.  A game can't be composed exclusively of bangs, for instance; there is space between them, and that space is filled with... what?                        </br></br></div>

So Ron, steam-cleaning Judd's character wasn't Force?  What if he wanted to be City Manager but remain shabbily pseudo-homeless?  What if he wanted to make a point of being that scary-to-look-at guy but be invested with municipal power?                        </div>

There. <i>There</i> it is. Right fucking there.<br/>
<br/>
If by "structured" you mean "GM takes over player-characters at will, with no negotiation," then such play is incompatible with Bangs.<br/>
<br/>
That's your mental knot. You are just not seeing that a notion about what to throw at a player, even a rather organized and pointed one, is not Force if it doesn't infringe on the player's right to respond. That is, as I see it, a mental scarring on your part. Someone, somewhere, forced your character into stuff by overriding your decisions or potential decisions in the process. And there was nothing for you to do, because dealing with that stuff was "playing" in the first place, as that person or group saw it.<br/>
<br/>
That's all I got for this thread. I'm stickin' with the Forge thread from this point on to avoid confusion.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>A game can't be composed exclusively of bangs, for instance; there is space between them, and that space is filled with... what?</blockquote>
The activity (and by 'activity', I want to conjure the furor of movement that arises within a kicked anthill) that results from the player's reaction to that Bang; whatever that reaction and resulting activity is, and however long it takes.
<blockquote>BANG:<br>GM: "Your sister isn't home, there's a note on the door saying she went to talk to Big Shiv."<br>Player: "Fuck. Umm... Okay, I head down to Big Shiv's pool hall."<br>GM: "... interesting.  Okay, you head inside, and it takes your eyes about the same amount of time to adjust to the gloom as it does for Shiv's thugs to recognize you as the guy that Shiv specifically ordered 'never to come back to my place, again, evah.'  They're heading your way."<br>Player: *sigh* "Yeah... I figured. Damn..."</br></br></br></br></blockquote>
Now... the fallout from THAT scene might be one or six or seven or fifty-eight following scenes where 'what we're framing next' is clearly obvious, resulting activity from that Bang... during that time:<br><br>1. The GM is going to have piles of NPCs in those scenes, and each of those guys WANTS something, and they're going to try to get what they want in some way, and playing that is the GMs job -- it's not *automatically* GM Force to say "there's fifty guys in the bar, and when Shiv says 'kick his ass', 25 of them get up to do just that." (It *could* be, yes -- if, for example, the GM is doing that to <b>negate the player's legitimate choice</b> of coming to the Pool Hall, because the GM doesn't want the player to 'ruin the plot' by talking to Shiv or the PC's sister right now, or something -- but it is not automatically Force.)<br>2. The setting itself has some 'physical laws' (gravity, air pressue, inertia, magic, super technology, sorcery) that the GM is obliged to 'accurately' reflect, by which I mean 'according to the tone of the game'.  It's not GM Force to say "if you stand in the middle of the busy highway, at midnight, you're gonna get hit by a fucking car."<br><br>Eventually, all that furor of activity will start to tail off, and somewhere before everyone starts thumb-twiddling, you drop another Bang.<br><br>... that's what's in between.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            So, Josh... what's the alternative?  That you determine how your character addresses the issue and resolves the problem without any input from the GM?<br><br>And then, did the way the GM set up the issue in the first place infringe on your ability to thematically address the problem?<br><br>It seems the solution to your issue is for you to write a story all by yourself.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Is that GM Force, since the player wants things that he doesn't actually have the power to effect in the game?</blockquote>
Given a liberal enough definition, <b>anything</b> can be a GM force.  The GM certainly always has the <i>tools</i> for a force.  Controlling the circumstances before and after a bang are trivial powers compared to her ability to control <i>when a bang will happen</i>.  It's effectively the power to frame the question.  if one wants to add in subtle nuance of description and the like, the GMs power can be absolutely conspiratorial in its scope.<br><br>That said, the GM also always has the tools to be throwing dice at her players heads.  That does not mean she's doing so.<br><br>There's an assumption of agenda which is not only false, but actually runs contrary to what some GMs strive for.  The GM whose agenda is to empower the players and be responsive to their needs and interests has the same tools as the railroad engineer. The difference is in how they're used.<br><br>The problem with conflating GM power with a force is that a force (in the colloquial* sense - I don't know Ron's definition well enough to address it) does not depend on a disparity of power, but on a disparity of information.  It is not the disparity itself which creates the force, but rather the <i>exploitation</i> of that disparity.  Similarly, in any game with a strong GM, there are many potential abuses (of which a force is only one) but they are only potentials, not certainties.<br><br/>So is a bang a force? Not necesarily. Can a bang be a force? Absolutely!<br/><br/>But if so, so what?<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>* - as in "Magician's Force"                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Josh: I want to resolve this with without violence<br/>Judson: Okay, how do you accomplish that?  For a start, Big Shiv has reason to see you in the hospital, and he doesn't go anywhere without bodyguards.  If you want suggestions, you might try calling him, or arrange with another gangster to set up a sit-down.  Or maybe your sister has a cell-phone?<br/><br/>As a cross-bleed, from the thread over at the Forge, my take away is that Ron's definition of illusionism is (at least to me) readily identifiable as nightmarish play.  I'm not entirely sure that GM-force from the Forge glossary is useful to me personally as a player or designer, because it's mis-use throws so many big red flags for me on it's own, much the same way as I have only an academic interest in the differences between the types of diabetes.                        </div>

                            Okay, guys?<br/><br/>I'm not saying that GM Force is a bad thing.  I'm not saying that the GM using Force to get at a Bang is a bad thing.  I'm not saying that the GM having input into how a theme is addressed or resolved is a bad thing.<br/><br/>I'm saying that the GM uses Force in order to contextualize and pace Bangs, that the GM therefore has input to those Bangs, and <em>isn't that fucking awesome?</em><br/><br/>So my 'alternative' to Big Shiv is not that I should get some sort of carte blanche to do whatever I like, but that I can't resolve the Bang/issue/premise without some buy-in, contribution, and interpretation on the part of the GM.

And I'm saying, "Hey, lookit that, the GM uses Force in a productive manner!"<br/><br/>Am I making sense, or are flying donkeys pouring out of my mouth?                        </div>

                            Couple funky things about that game.  We were sharing characters between me, JJ and another guy we had just met but seemed swell.<br/><br/>We were all just shocked and were really into it.  We all took turns describing his "cleaning up" as I recall it and how incomplete it was, how the madman was still under there but now he had a desk.<br/><br/>The game wasn't going well until that moment and when that bang hit, I wanted to play that character, who suddenly was a surprise instead of just another shell-shocked vet with an END IS NIGH sign on a street-corner.<br/><br/>What if you gave that madman on the streetcorner a position in city government?<br/><br/>What kind of mayor does that?!?  What the fuck is up with that Mayor and...WHAT IS HIS DEMON?!?<br/><br/>It wasn't force because Ron wasn't banking on any one response from us, he wasn't forcing us into one spot, he responded to our response from the mayor, we responded to the mayor's offer and it wasn't forcing, we were surfing off of each other's input.<br/><br/>And despite that game not being particularly successful, I really wanted to know where that wave was going.                        </div>

                            I'm saying the moment the GM says, "the thugs start after you" he's introducing violence -- at the very least the concept of violence -- into the picture.  If we could elaborate the situation further, the GM might respond to my 'peaceful solutions' by pushing a theme that might resemble 'sometimes you've got to break a few heads.'  The tension between my character's desire for peaceful solutions and the GM's insistence that the world ain't going to let me have my idealism without a contest, is what makes the game interesting.                        </div>

                            The distinction is, I think, between creating the necessity of a choice and constraining a choice.  There's a lot of overlap there, but there are some practical distinctions between creating the situation which calls for a choice (Thugs show up) and limiting the range of responses ("Do you fight, or jump out the window?").  In that any choice is based on a limitation on options, it might very loosely be called a force, but at that point the definition gets so gauzy as to be meaningless.  <br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Joshua, you simply are not supporting your point. Your two statements are <i>not giving enough information</i>. You seem to be working with some notion that either the player is handed an utterly blank canvas and a perkily-compliant GM, or it's a "limit" and therefore "Force" must be involved.<br/>
<br/>
No, Force is not defined as a GM limiting the choices of PCs. I really hate to wave the definition at you, but I simply have to, at this point:<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">The Technique of control over characters' thematically-significant decisions by anyone who is not the character's player.</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
Did I say "limit?" I did not. I said control. Did I say "options?" I did not. I said thematically-significant decisions (and I'll be happy to substitute Gamist and Simulationist equivalents for "thematically" if needed; for now, let's say CA-relevant).<br/>
<br/>
See? It's not about limits. Part of a GM's job in a particular game may well be all about being the limit-person, and that does not mean by definition that he or she is exerting Force.<br/>
<br/>
Force is very, very specific. I reach over and take <i>control</i> of your characters' <i>thematically-relevant decision</i> (to stick with the Narrativist context). I can do it very harshly, just overtly playing your guy, suck it up. I can do it sneakily, by situationally placing the character in a way which socially manipulates you into behaving like I want.<br/>
<br/>
But if I merely say, "Hey, how about next morning, you wake up in the boat," and you say, "Sure!" and we start that scene ... that ain't Force.<br/>
<br/>
And if I say, "Hey, how about you're in your office," and you say, "Sure!" and then I say, "The thugs come in! They attack! They're gonna pound your face into pizza for what you did to Louie!" ... that ain't Force either.<br/>
<br/>
I dunno, man. I tried not to shove that definition at you, but it just doesn't seem to be working any other way.<br/>
<br/>
Best, Ron                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>The problem with conflating GM power with a force is that a force (in the colloquial* sense - I don't know Ron's definition well enough to address it) does not depend on a disparity of power, but on a disparity of information.</blockquote>
See, I find that in particular fascinating.  Because that's the definition of force that sticks with me as well: like a magician's force.  Of which the simplest possible example is:<br><br>Me:  Hey, I'm going to write down a number, which I predict you will select!<br>You: Um, okay.<br>Me: Okay, now, of the numbers one, two or three, pick two.<br>You: What, like two and three?<br>Me: Exactly.  So what does that leave behind?<br>You: Um, one.  Duh.<br>Me: Of course it does, which is what you will find written down.<br><br>It's a dumb trick, because no matter what the audience decides, the magician gets to pick the actual result, but it can be really effective.  And with that term in my brain, a "GM's force" had an obvious implication.  Especially when there's an association with illusionism.<br><br>But the Forge definition of Force is different, even though there's some overlap.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Ron, this is where I get all editorial and nitpicky about diction and phrasing.  The definition, with which I am familiar, says "a technique of control" whereas you are using it here as "taking control."  The latter is exclusive and absolute; the former is not.  There's a big difference between the GM <em>taking control</em> to the point at which the player no longer has any control whatsoever and any number of control-sharing techniques where different players have different control over different aspects of the fiction/story/setting/situation.<br><br>If we're talking about the GM taking control, or to put a finer point on it, the GM taking <em>all</em> control, then Force becomes such a narrow phenomenon as to be almost useless.  How often does the GM take full control of a player character?  More importantly, how often does a player come back to such a GM if he doesn't like that?  I think what's more likely is that Force, which is a label applied to an identified phenomenon, as you say, is more accurately the player <em>taking umbrage</em> at the level of control that the GM has claimed.<br><br>Because, really, the GM has some control over the players, just as the players have some control over the setting/situation/world/whatever.  If we didn't have overlapping and intersecting control, there'd be no interaction; there'd be no <em>game</em>.  There's a broad spectrum between "GM exerting almost no influence over player character actions" and "GM dictating all player character actions."  Somewhere along that spectrum, you've drawn a line and said that one side is Force and the other isn't.  Where that line is drawn is determined by whether the decision is "significant" which is hardly a black-and-white affair.  What is significant to one person may not be significant to another; what seems significant now may not be significant later (and vice versa).  The criteria of the definition is incredibly vague.  I find this a little naive and not incredibly useful.<br><br>What benefit do you see in defining "Force" in such terms?  Perhaps I'm not seeing it.  Or maybe it's not as widely applicable a concept as I thought it to be.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            First of all, yes, it is not as widely applicable as you had thought. I've been saying that for a while throughout this thread. Even in this post, you extend the concept of "control" to a much larger and much more neutral topic of input or contribution ... or perhaps authority. Perhaps it will help to say that by "control," I am not referring to authority over some imagined element. I'm talking about control in a far more limited sense.<br/>
<br/>
Second, we can push and hammer and shove about the "degree of control" until the cows come home. I am saying there is a hard limit, a boundary, over which the person who owns that character has been shorn of a key factor in play - the actual ability and opportunity to fulfil his or her end of a Creative Agenda by using/playing that character.<br/>
<br/>
Is that boundary in the same place for all people with all characters in all games? I see no reason to think so. But I think that such a boundary does exist, intrinsic to the activity. That boundary is what I'm talking about with "control" in the definition. I don't think the word "all" needs to be applied, but I do think "over the boundary" is the topic at hand.<br/>
<br/>
If, in your experience, that is rare, then you may count yourself a fortunate role-player. I have known and observed many people who are convinced that role-playing cannot occur <i>unless</i> such control is in action.<br/>
<br/>
Enough for the day, I think.<br/>

                            As one of the people who got strongly involved in Force discussions, I think I agree with Ron about the limits of its applicability. As a concept it pretty much, as far as I can tell, only applies to an explicit, for-real, character hijack*. Even telling the player the character will face certain death if they choose a course of action may not be Force since the character could decide "X is worth dying for."<br><br>That said, I think the concept of Force--even at that level of specificity--is problematic.<br><br>For one thing, it's problematic because there is *so much* other stuff the GM can do to exert pressure that singling out one of them (the character hijack) for discussion creates a false sense of emphasis. I'm less interested, in general, in the GM who says "Your character feels fear and runs from the Black Knight!" than the GM who simply creates the character, stats and rolls on the table, in such a way as to ensure that I cannot beat the character in order to force me to resolve the plot in the way he wants (in this example, I think <i>not illusionism</i>).<br><br>So I think that 'Force' as a term (and illusionism, which is problematic because it is both a technique and a mode of play and means different things in both cases) actually confuses some discussions (and man, did it confuse discussions I was in).<br><br>But I would say this: if we assume that the GM is allowed to generate bangs and still allow for thematic, player-driven play, then we have to acknowledge that the shape of that play is still largely shaped by the GM. The question is as imporant as the answer, IMO--and if the GM is posing most/all of the questions--and can follow up one question with another, that's an awesome amount of control over the narrative and the direction of the story.<br><br>In that sense, while not "illusonism" or "force," I think it is <i>reasonable</i> to say that bangs represent a powerful tool for GM authorial input into the game and may even constitute a form of story control depending on how the participants wish to define such a thing.<br/><br/>-Marco<br/>* Ron suggests there are sneaky ways to do this manipulatively. I'm not sure what those are or what that would look like--Ron? Maybe you can expound on that?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Joshua, it seems like you want to have a broad discussion about the GM's influence over the actions of the players. I don't know that I have a lot to contribute, but I'm interested in reading it. But... I'd also like to stick with a narrower definition of Force and Illusionism. I've been in Illusionist games and been tapped upside the head by Force, and so when you say "warmed-over Illusionism", I'm hearing "crappy techniques used by lousy GMs to eliminate that frustrating player input thing." I think it's convenient for me to have a single word for when a GM stomps on my opportunity to do something cool with my character, and I thought Force was the word. If we're going to come up with a much broader definition, can I have a word for the thing that makes me so angry?<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, stripped of the disputes about definitions and my unfortunate desire to join in them, this is an interesting thread. At the very least it highlights the need for open communication between player and GM... which now that I think of it, has never been there when I've seen Force  (narrowly defined) employed.                        </div>

... the GM isn't ...<br/><br/>Okay, either Shiv is sending bodyguards at you, or the GM is, to block the PLAYER. Which is it?  Because Shiv sending bodyguards after the player -- that's the game, man, and it doesn't in any way detract from the awesome of your choice.  The *GM* sending thugs after your character is him blocking you.<br/><br/>If you're in the former situation, you sit down with the GM and say "so is there a way I can do this, or is Shiv just totally unreachable, they way he lives?"  If you're in the later, you sit down with the GM and say "dude, what the fuck's up?"<br/><br/>Now, in your example, I sense a good amount of GM-dickery, and start to agree with Ron a little, but that's my take on it.                        </div>

I'll take a stab at this, since Ron's out for the day, and I (unlike Josh) don't find this particular tactic particularly rare in play at all.<br/><br/>Force.  Two examples, using the Big Shiv At the Pool Hall situation.<br/><br/>Example One: Hard Force<br/>GM: "You walk in, and Shiv's guys recognize you and move toward you with pool cues and stuff.  Roll initiative."<br/>Player: "Whoa, I'm looking for a peaceful solution to talking to Shiv."<br/>GM: "... the first guy hits your AC... 14 points of damage... ow.  What're you attacking with?"<br/>Player: "I don't want to fight in the first place."<br/>GM: "Okay, so just your fists."<br/>[The player can roll for their character if they want, but if not, the GM will -- the fight's gonna happen, period.]<br/><br/>Example Two: Doyce's Lame example of sneaky, soft (Illusion) Force<br/>GM: "You walk in, and Shiv's guys recognize you and move toward you with pool cues and stuff."<br/>Player: "Whoa, I'm looking for a peaceful solution to talking to Shiv."<br/>GM: "Yeah... they really aren't.  Roll initiative?"<br/>Player: "Do I have to if I run the hell out of here and try this some other time?"<br/>GM: "Well, probably. There's... see here? The guy, by the doorway, right here, blocking your retreat, and he got a 24 on initiative, so he's moving to block you, probably before you can act.<br/>Player: "I was into the room that far?"<br/>GM: "That's what I figured, if you wanted to see Shiv once your eyes adjusted.  The good news is, there's a couple pool cues on the table next to you, and I'll let you use em with your savate skill... so it's a big bonus for you..."<br/>[GM continues with Carrot-Stick tricks until the player finally caves in and fights.]<br/><br/>In both examples, all relevant thematic choices have been taken from the player.<br/><br/>-------------------<br/><br/>Then, just for something completely different.<br/><br/>Not Force Example:<br/><br/>GM: "You walk in, and Shiv's guys recognize you and move toward you with pool cues and stuff."<br/>Player: "Whoa, I'm looking for a peaceful solution to talking to Shiv."<br/>GM: "Yeah... they really aren't."<br/>Player: "So... I fight... or I stand here and let them beat the shit out of me to prove a point, or I retreat to try it my way at a better time?"<br/>GM: "Sure... or something else. It's all good."<br/>Player: "Okay, I'm gonna get the hell out of here."<br/>GM: "Awesome.  There's a guy in your way, here, and that's going to oppose your roll to get out of here, so we might be looking at your getting passively pounded on anyway, if you can't make it past him."<br/>Player: "I hate these guys... okay, let's do this."<br/><br/>In this example, the player's choices in how to deal with the situation ALL REMAIN VALID, but the GM might still block him from SUCCESSFULLY REALIZING HIS CHOICE, via a combination of setting, system, et cetera et cetera, because that's his job.<br/><br/>And that isn't Force.                        </div>

                            It's a decent example--but I'm not sure I agree with it.<br/><br/>1. In the hard-force example so long as the GM will actually start rolling dice for the PC, that's fine. I agree: Force.<br/><br/>2. In the "sneaky" example, though, I have some problems. I remember an example of a GM framing a character in a horror game to a graveyard. In the graveyard, there's an attack by a ghoul. Now: it is probably possible that with sufficiently paranoid tactical play the horror-player could get into the graveyard in such a way as to not be attacked by the ghoul (but it's not clear how). Otherwise, the attack happens: the ghoul will not negoitiate and while the player might be able to escape, I would not presume it is "all good."<br/><br/>Rather, I would presume that in the functional-framing example, an attack with no clear way out is still possible and still valid. <br/><br/>I'm not sure that the GM in the third example is necessarily more committed to player-choice than the second. He may just be using different langauge assuming the GM in the second. If the third GM blocks the character's attempt to escape ("Well, you go for the door--but hey, the guy rolled a 24 Initiative!") then I don't know it's different at all (unless the difference lies in the mind of the GM).<br/><br/>Now, if the idea is that as the player continues to try to run (taking the hit from the 24 Init guy to keep going) and the GM will continue to invent obstacles to keep him in the room, I can see it being manipulation. Certainly.<br/><br/>But even then I'm not sure I'd call it <i>Force</i>. If the player decides to simply get beat-up/killed, he may be able to "force" the pacificist outcome as well (with the same power, even: threatening the death of the power and the end of the game*).<br/><br/>-Marco<br/>* It may be that the game will go on without the player--but that's not always a given. I've seen games stop because a PC got slaughtered. I've seen players use that to negoitiate in games with GMs who wanted to keep the game going. I wouldn't call this "Player Force," however.                        </div>

                            Thought #1: Most of our examples or thoughts in this thread concern "the GM" in an overly-abstract way. A quick review of the definition shows that it does not specify a GM - only one person who is designated in some way as that character's owner, and another person who nabs that control. I understand that most examples of play will match the player-GM thing, but I've seen plenty of Force exerted by one non-GM toward another non-GM, or toward an NPC. The phenomenon is the same.<br/>
<br/>
Thought #2: These soundbyte hypothetical examples aren't going to help, for dozens of reasons. The main one is that it's always easy to tweak them slightly as a reader, providing unseen, personally-invented backstory, so that the point made by the writer is negated. "But that might not be Force! Because <i>if</i> ..." and we can "if if if" all day long. For real-play examples, I also suggest taking one another's word for whether ownership got nabbed really-and-truly or not, as they were there and you weren't, but fat chance of that, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Thought #3: There is no confusion about the definition. The definition is what it is, and I want to stress that the term came last - it arose out of explicit and high-communication dialogues about real play, in which the <i>phenomenon</i> was first identified and discussed. If someone is having trouble with the definition, then I think it's a matter of disagreement on some other level, because the phenomenon is a real thing and the term is a mere label for it.<br/>
<br/>
One last one: I think the pace of yesterday's discussion was a mistake and resulted in a net loss of communication and value. I think about 70% of what I've said in this thread has been poorly-processed, at least as illustrated by the posts. Rather than try to move forward at the same time as trying to recoup that 70%, I'm going to point backwards and say "Said a lot of stuff back there. If you're really interested in learning what I think and why, check it out. This wave-front reactive posting this is not for me."<br/>

                            And I'll chime in that this discussion hasn't been about my original post for some time.  I <em>know</em> what a bang is.  I <em>know</em> that the GM isn't invested in how the player reacts once the bang happens.  My point was that the GM <em>is</em> invested in getting the player to the damn bang in the first place.  I'm really, really, profoundly tired of being told what a bang is and what an entire illusionist game looks like from a bird's-eye view.  If anybody wants to go back and read the OP, I might be interested in discussing the topic.  I'm not interested in rehashing the definition of bang again.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>The GM then gets the characters to the Bangs and lets the players make their decisions.</blockquote>
This is what I am questioning in your original post.<br><br>The expected/proper sequence for Bang use is, as far as I understand it, is this:<br><br>1.  The GM prepares a set of Bangs out of Kickers and Flags and whatever else.<br><br>2.  The GM then watches play for an opportunity to use them.  <br><br>2a.  If an opportunity shows up, toss it down.  <br/>2b.  If not, the Bang doesn't get used.<br/><br/>3.  If a Bang the GM has not prepared suddenly occurs to him, as a result of events in the fiction, the GM is more than capable and allowed to Bang using a non-prepared Bang that he simply comes up with in the spur of the moment.<br/><br/>There's no implicit "ah, I have this Bang, therefore I must guide play to get this Bang out there" in the process as I understand it. Bangs can most certainly not be used, and at least some are expected not to be used.  Contradictory Bangs can be planned.<br/><br/>Ideally, a GM is not invested in getting a player to any particular Bang - this is why he plans an entire Bandolier of Bangs (to use some old terminology) - and a GM accepts that a particular Bang may not be used, perhaps just not in a given session, perhaps <i>ever</i>.  The GM keeps the Bangs in reserve, and when he sees a spot in the game to toss them out, he does.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Holy, this is throwing off a lot of heat.<br/><br/>Joshua: If I understand your question right, you're asying "don't I need to indulge in Force in order to pose the question?" To which I respond with another question: "are you overriding other decisions which your or the players regard as thematically important in order to get to the question?"<br/><br/>If the answer is "yes", you're not playing a "pure Bang" type of game, you're playing "Bangs-with-Illusions", where you have stretches of Illusionism guiding the characters from one Bang to another. (If the "destination Bangs" are designed in response to decisions made at earlier Bangs, then that's one thing, but if you are pushing the players from predetermined Bang to predetermined Bang then, er, you're not using Bangs at all.)<br/><br/>If the answer is "no", you're playing pure Bang style.<br/><br/>To engage with your DitV example of a man walking into town to find an old friend falling out of a window at him: plonking the character on a road going into town, and having the house his friend falls out of on that road, isn't using Force, it's posing the "opening question" (which is inherently going to require a bit more GM input than usual unless the character is following up a Kicker, or a previous Bang, or whatever). However, you <i>would</i> be using Force if you let him get into town, make a decision about where he wanted to go, and then had his chum fall on him anyhow, because you'd be effectively ignoring his decision and going with your pre-planned event.<br/><br/>So, this is a Bang:<br/><br/>Context -&gt; Event -&gt; Decision<br/><br/>(Context: "Here I am walking into town."<br/>Event: "Holy smokes, that's Fred falling out that window!"<br/>Decision: "I swear by all that's holy, I will not leave this town until I avenge you Fred!")<br/><br/>Force doesn't come into play because you are not meddling with previous Decisions of the player in order to get the Context you need for the Event. The next Bang will come along when the Context produced by the player's Decision leads to the Event the Bang is structured around.<br/><br/>This is Illusionism:<br/><br/>Context -&gt; Decision -&gt; Event<br/><br/>(Context: "Here I am, in the middle of town."<br/>Decision: "Think I'll swing by the barber's and get a haircut."<br/>Event: "Hey, Fred's falling out of that window!")<br/><br/>Force has been used here in order to plunk down the Event right after the player's Decision, regardless of what it was. If the player had gone to the barber and gotten chatting to him, found out that his friend was in town, and decided to go visit him, that would not be using Force - the player's decisions have established a new Context in which the Event you've planned for the Bang can happen.<br/><br/>Another thing: I get the impression, reading some of your responses, that you're wondering whether GMs can sneakily engage in Illusionism by posing a Bang in a particular way. I think that they can, but a) if they do it no longer qualifies as a Bang and b) a GM can pose a question to rule out certain solutions whilst still being open to any other answer the player comes up with.<br/><br/>In a situation where only one course of action is sensible, you've not got a Bang. You've only got Illusionism if you pretend to your players that there's a decision to be made there. If you're being particularly aggressive about the scene framing, this is precisely the sort of situation you wouldn't include in a game, although some players may prefer to play through it anyhow. ("Hey, just because there's only one path here doesn't mean I don't want to admire the view along it.")<br/><br/>In a situation where multiple course of action can be sensibly adopted, even if there's only two of them, in my view <i>you still have a Bang</i> - again, assuming that you don't pretend to the players there are more courses than actually exist. "I only have time to save one person - do I save the little girl or the President?" is an important thematic decision by anyone's standard. Furthermore, one thing I've learned is that if a GM thinks there's only two ways a situation can go, the players will come up with a viable third option. And again, I don't think it's Force to phrase a question in a way which restricts the number of viable answers, because Force is "deciding the answer" not "posing the question". (It <i>would</i> be Force to set up a situation which looks like a binary decision and then make one of the choices Clearly Wrong.)<br/><br/>Last point: while "I walk away from the situation and forget all about it" is always a legitimate answer, I kind of regard it as evidence that the Bang has <i>failed</i>. The point of a Bang is to provoke an important, thematic decision from the player character, and if the PC doesn't get involved in the situation the Bang presents then they're not deciding anything, they're abdicating responsibility.. (This isn't always the case, of course - choosing to spare the life of the man you've been hunting down for years is an important thematic decision, after all. Choosing not to chase after him in the first place would have been an abdication.)<br/><br/>Your DitV example highlights this for me - sure, the PC could very well have just walked away from the corpse of his friend like a cold-hearted bastard, but then, er, he'd be a cold-hearted bastard. Presumably, the player decided that his character was not that kind of guy, and had him act accordingly. In this case, making the guy important to his PC wasn't using Force, it was just sensible Bang construction. There is a certain onus on the GM to make sure that Bangs are actually interesting enough to merit the characters' attention, after all.                        </div>

The bizarre thing is that the phenomenon best illustrated here to my eyes is a failure of communication.  On the one hand, Josh's question seemed to be "if I have Bangs, how do I get players to them without Force, and thereby be using Illusionism?"  And the response has been "Bangs are different from Illusionism, because with Bangs you have a choice!"  Which believe it or not <strong>completely misses Josh's point.</strong><br/><br/>Ron made a very clear example on the Forge, which might have helped more here, that basically laid out that Ron's definition of "Force" is incredibly narrow - basically a GM does have the power and responsibility to frame scenes and the like, which isn't Force is Ron's view.  Honestly, his explanation of Illusionism sounds like a patently awful game, one I can't imagine completing a session of.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Ron's definition of Force doesn't seem to be universal.  Rob and I share a definition of "a force" that comes from close up magic, which strikes me as a perfectly reasonable definition, and frequently a perfectly reasonable technique in play.  Obviously, this is the definition I like best.<br/><br/>The prevailing view, though, seems to define "force" more like a civics textbook, and draws a hard line between a player's freedom and the GM's force.  As a result, you can't really do anything without that kind of force, since even sliding a generic bang into a character's way might be considered a kind of force.  As GM you get to make up the situation, which is part of your power and ergo a force.  <br/><br/>To be honest, I personally don't find either the narrow diagnostic (from the Forge Glossary) "force" definition, or the broad civics-y colloquial definition very useful.  But I do like using the magic-trick version, because then it's a trick you can teach to other GMs, maybe even put it in an advice section somewhere, and talk about when it's useful, and when it is and isn't okay to use.                        </div>

Yes.  That is my understanding as well, and how I use the tool, and why I disagree with the idea that the GM is moving events, ouija-board style, to 'get' to a prepped Bang.<br/><br/>I never meant to imply that anyone didn't understand the definition of Illusionism or Bang -- it's just that, based on my use of Bangs, I don't see where illusionism or Force is used to 'get' to a Bang -- it's like saying I'm trying to steer a hiking trip to the point where I can 'get' to something in my pocket... I mean, it doesn't *matter* where we go or what we do -- I can pull whatever that item is out of my pocket whenever I want... but I'd be better served if I waited until (or if) we get to a point in the hike where whatever's in my pocket is actually useful.<br/><br/>Apologies if my chiming in wasn't helpful.                        </div>

                            I know Josh said he's done, but I wanted to address the point that I think he was getting at. Whether or not it's called Force or not, everybody agrees that the GM does something to set up bangs. And planned bang can't form itself out of nothing. Actually sometimes players "bang" themselves. That is, I've often seen player A set up a bang for his own character.<br/>
<br/>
"Ragnar goes to the bar where those two guys are that attacked his sister. I'm not sure what's going to happen."<br/>
<br/>
This is the player using the normal authority given to him over his character to create a bang. GM's do the same thing, using their normal authority to create bangs. Everybody agrees that GM's do this, and what level of control this involves has to do with what the game prescribes, or just what technique the players allow. That is, in some games, the GM does this with rather traditional "can't direct player actions." And in others, like Ron's example, GM control does extend to PCs.<br/>
<br/>
So what level of control over PCs the GM has when setting up a bang is absolutely independent of whether or not that play is narrativism, or has bangs or whatever. You can create bangs with an entirely traditional GM player power split. Giving the GM more power over PCs may make it easier to set up bangs in certain circumstances, but in practice I've never had any problem setting up bangs with the traditional power split.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the techniques that I use are pretty illusiony, actually. For example, I use the "magician's force" all the time. Contrary to what Rob says above (I may be misreading), magician's force is just fine to use, so long as it's being used to set up bangs. Just not to resolve situation.<br/>
<br/>
Rob, you're altering the definition of bangs when you say that some Bangs use Force. What can be said, however, is that sometimes bangs are off base. In which case we often call them something like "failed bangs." Or "non-bangs." Often this is because the player doesn't find the question asked by the bang to be relevant to his character. If the player simply doesn't care what the answer is, he'll just take the obvious choice, and then he's not gotten to engage in the creative agenda here.<br/>
<br/>
But also common is that the player will see only one option as viable. That is, basically, the GM accidentally presents a situation to which the player sees that there never was any question as to which way the character can go. For the player making this "obvious" decision, then, this is a non-bang.<br/>
<br/>
What's interesting, however, is that for the other players playing - often for the GM who invented the bang - the player's play in this case will seem very narrativism oriented. And, in fact, often players who run their characters through failed bangs end up reaping mechanical and/or social rewards for doing so.<br/>
<br/>
This is because, while the choice in question seems obvious to the player of the character who feels he knows the character well in these circumstances, for the other players surprised, apparently they don't know the character that well.<br/>
<br/>
Another perspective on bangs is that you could define them as moments where you learn something new about the character. Character development is the literary term. If the GM makes some decision for a character that's simply in-character, he hasn't made a choice that's in any way thematic. He's "just" playing the character according to his role. I quote just, because, of course this is an important and fun part of all play. It's just not action that creates any sort of specific agenda (if it's all you're doing, then its simulationism).<br/>
<br/>
Now, again, if the player doesn't feel that he's learned anything new about his character, then, though the play may be enjoyable for the other players as audience, it's not an example of a bang, because the player didn't actually have a chance to engage in the creative agenda.<br/>
<br/>
But so what?<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of play in every form of play that comes down to, as Walt Freitag would call it, zilchplay. That is, it isn't the sort of creation that's part of any creative agenda - "just" exploration. Exploration is fun in RPGs, so this play is fun, too. It's just that for a player in a game with a narrativism agenda overall, you eventually want to get them to a good bang.<br/>

                            Continued from above...<br/>
<br/>
Now, different groups are going to have different rates of acceptability. My groups are quite lenient, because I may only present them with one real bang every two sessions of IRC play. Sometimes less. What often saves play is that players will create bangs for each other spontaneously. Last session, using a lot of director stance related authority, Adrienne decided that the Dueling club that Fred's character had joined, was run by a man who was the brother of a man who her character had been involved in murdering many years previous. Her character and Fred's are married. So when her character revealed this information to his character, suddenly Fred is hit with this huge bang about how his character will react. He had his character become melancholy, saying, "I never do anything right." Which is, in some ways, very radically off from what you might expect his character to do. So he got to be very thematically creative, and we all enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I can't actually say that this was narrativism for Fred. Fred claims to channel this character, so, for him, it may have been the "obvious" thing to do, and he was simply satisfying a sim agenda. I'm not too concerned, personally. I think he got to satisfy some creative agenda either way, and the revelation to the rest of we players as to what Okhfels is now like with his wife was fun to watch. So it created theme for us, and suited our narrativism agenda just fine.<br/>
<br/>
OK, so there's my Actual Play example.<br/>
<br/>
The point is that Adrienne used a lot of authority that players in other games often do not have (there's nothing in HQ to suggest that they should have this sort of authority - we've just agreed that these techniques are all valid coming from my suggestion that we use them). And she created a situation that gave Fred a thematic choice.<br/>
<br/>
The flip side of the coin on failed bangs are "overrun bangs." Yes, in using his authority, a GM can actually miss an opportunity for a bang, and manipulate the situation such that it eliminates this potential bang. In that case, the player may feel that Force has been used. Indeed, technically it has been used. So, yes, sometimes force (even the Ron/Mike definition) is used in setting up bangs. Heck, in some cases this may even be intentional. I may well overrun some small bang, in my rush to get to another that is much larger and which seems more fun or important to me.<br/>
<br/>
As a GM, I have to estimate the value of each and every bang. And, as a human, I'm going to fail. A lot. There is one technique by which this can be greatly ameliorated, however. Allow players to challenge your authority when this happens. "Hey, let's go back a bit, to where my character has to decide whether or not to even go to the tavern." I think most of my players are aware that this is kosher, and will do it if they see me overrunning some bang that they want to play out. In this way we share "control" of situation and create bangs collaboratively, by getting the player input on what they do consider to be important bangs.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, when I say, "Hey, anybody got an idea for a scene?" what I'm largely saying is, "I don't have any strong bangs prepared...can anybody come up with a situation to have the characters in that is likely to lead to a bang?" Even if the scene set-up isn't directly a bang itself, it's often a flag (or even flag-set) that points towards the sort of bang that the player wants. So even more collaboration there.<br/>
<br/>
Here's an interesting thing. In Sorcerer, one assumes relatively short arcs of play. Compared to, say, the 60+ session arcs that I've been running in HQ. So the text suggests that you'll need to always refresh your bangs when they're used. What I've found is that after a character has been in a couple dozen sessions, you can stop planning entirely. Oh, I think about things to throw at characters, but I find just going over the situation in my head is plenty enough prep. The bangs that I create these days for long running characters, I just come up with on the spur of the moment. And, again, not very often. Because between me hitting the PC with bangs, the other players hitting the PC with bangs, and the player of the PC hitting their own character with bangs, and the players and I collaborating on setting up situation to lead to bangs, I only have to do a relatively small part of the work.<br/>

<br/>
Occasionally with really developed characters bangs just happen accidentally. We're "just playing" when suddenly someone stops and goes, "ooooh, yeah...what are you going to do about that?" and everyone nods, realizing that the situation has suddenly created a thematic decision for some player. This might not meet some technical definition of bangs - I may be stretching it a bit. But thematic decisions do arise out of nowhere on occasion, bangs or not.<br/>
<br/>
(I'll be hard pressed to come up with an example, as it's rare. But it's not theoretical, I can recall noting them happening. Perhaps somebody can help me out with an example.)<br/>
<br/>
And often my bangs are completely opportunistic. That is, the situation is almost at a place where the decision has to be made. All I have to do is to add the slightest change to the situation. Often it's "X walks into the room, and sees you two kissing. Now what are you gonna do?"<br/>
<br/>
Yes, in some modes of play, this sort of thing is seen as an exceptional use of authority. In gamism, for example, orchestrating situation so that the players aren't on a level playing field is considered a violation of the agenda. As such, many players trained like this will see the GM doing this sort of thing as taking advantage of his or her authority to control NPCs and other situational elements to create a hard decision as a foul. This is a very simple agenda conflict problem.<br/>
<br/>
This is what seems exceptional. It's not that the GM controls things, it's that he does so obviously with the intent of pushing the narrativism agenda. Just as altering situation to control the outcome of situations to control plot is indicative of sim-supporting play. Questions of what the GM controls, or techiques of control like magician's force, are irrellevant. The only question is whether the player on the end feels that he is getting to engage with the sim or nar creative agenda.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, this is somewhat tautological. Bangs are GM created events that support narrativism through giving the player a chance to create theme. It's Ron's term, from his game, and he can have it his way. What that leaves, however, are all sorts of "near bangs" and other sorts of things you can come up with that are somewhere in between. Lots of room for discussion of this subject matter without having to adhere to the definition of bangs.<br/>
<br/>
What's interesting to note is that Bangs are not the only way in which to create theme - I think people get obsessed about bangs as they're well enumerated as a technique. But that's for another thread.<br/>

And I still like "hijack" to mean what the Forge Glossary defines Force to mean.  Cuz force is too useful in terms of "the authority that the GM wields" and "a clever magicians trick that every GM should know."                        </div>

Yes, but each side more strictly defining their terms they became clear.

My favorite example of this is the use of the term cinematic in RPGs dating from about 1989. The first time I heard the term I thought it was used as the antithesis of of what we call gamism -- again, I thought. What the author was really trying to describe was a reaction to the term romanticism. To this day cinematic is used everywhere by people who clearly have no idea of any real meaning or definition of the word.                        </div>

Ross, in the 17th century, the word "Yankee" (or "little John" in Dutch) was a term of contempt, for someone disreputable.  <br><br>In the early 18th century it came to mean a resident of New England, again something of a term of disrepute.<br><br>Americans converted it to a term of pride, something applied up and down the Atlantic coast (even in Georgia) for a stalwart revolutionary.<br><br>In the 19th century the term shifted again, to be used as an approbrium in the south and a badge of honor in the north, a usage which continues in America to this day.<br><br>Overseas, the term "Yankee" or "Yanqui" or "Yank" tends to refer to any American, and can be insulting or not depending on the point of view of the user.<br><br>Words mean what people mean them to mean.

                            Ross, I agree that writing clearly is an important goal. But all languages change organically, and trying to prevent that is like holding back the sea. I think that it's more than possible to strike a workable balance between trying to freeze language as it is, right now (or in some idealised perfect state) and laissez faire "your trigzt is my frnarpnet" chaos. There are a lot of linguists out there who talk about exactly that (my favorite is <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/" rel="nofollow"> Language Log </a>).                        </div>

If GNS theory produced a single testable hypothesis or repeatable result then I might agree with this analogy.<br/><br/>More saliently, the problem with most Forge jargon is that terms are taken which have ordinary English uses and then given meanings which are not wholly dissimilar to those uses but also are not the same.  That creates needless confusion.<br/><br/>In physics, most jargon does not also have some commonly accepted and widespread usage that will be used in a similar context.  The Forge takes words that naturally get used in rpg conversations anyway and then changes the meaning enough to be unintuitive.<br/><br/>The problem with Forge jargon isn't the use of jargon, it's that the jargon is unusually unintuitive and routinely is just close enough to the normal meaning to create additional confusion.  Frankly, it's an appallingly bad use of English.<br/><br/>How did we get on to this topic btw?  I'm struggling to link any of this to illusionism?                        </div>

I think I'd describe it more as "ad hoc."  And sometimes pedantic.  Certainly misuse occurs sometimes because people are lazy and don't take the time to understand their terms.  But I'd suggest that misuse also occurs because the terms aren't always as descriptive as they'd usefully be.  For example, the Forge Glossary usage of "Force" is a gross synecdoche for colloquial "force."  And cinematic?  I'm not sure you can really expect any useful communication from casual usage.                        </div>

My own solution is to develop alternative terms for concepts and use them in place of what I see as broken jargon.  The test of their usefulness is if people understand me without the need for repeated in depth definitions, and the final proof would be when people start using different terms because they're more useful.                        </div>

I think some jargon now has to be stuck with, I don't think narrativist is at all a good term as it is way too close to a lot of stuff people think of as being a narrative but that isn't in the jargon sense, but narrativist is out there and I think with that the answer is just to refer people to the Glossary definition and make do with it.<br/><br/>Going forward, I think the answer is to learn from past mistakes and when coining new jargon, make a real effort not to coin terms that are:<br/><br/>1.  Very similar to a word's ordinary meaning but with subtle differences.<br/><br/>2.  Potentially insulting if read in their ordinary meaning.<br/><br/>3.  Cutesy, though in fairness that's because I just don't like cutesiness.<br/><br/>Nar we have, there's no point in changing it, though by God we could do better pointing people to the glossary which is the only pithy summary I've seen.  Why people still get referred to Forge threads when the glossary exists I have no idea.<br/><br/>I suppose my solution is use the damn glossary but in future avoid these errors.  Some terms, sim particularly, I think are unsalvageable but that in fairness is because I think the theory is flawed there, thus I don't think there is a single other term that would fit.  That's a tangent though.<br/><br/>Good challenge by the way.<br/><br/>Edit:  Damn glossary, because I'm frustrated it isn't referred to more.  I actually think the glossary is a good idea, I realised that the above might not have read that way.                        </div>

The value might be in a better vibe to the dialog. New people would find it presumably more accessible. We wouldn't have 'Narrativist == freeform' threads. The element of people being constantly corrected (espeically when the 'correction' is wrong or iffy) could be reduced. On the whole, it could be an improvement that would pay off in the mid-to-long term.<br/><br/>Beyond what Balbinus suggests, I think a habbit of explaining terms in some venues might help. That and acknowledging that the problem might, by itself, help a lot.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

I'd go further actually, and say that a good vibe in the dialogue is *the same thing as* being clear. If we're talking and you get what I'm saying and I get what you're saying, it doesn't matter whether we use the right terminology or not.<br/><br/>I'm increasingly coming to the conclusion that Theory Terminology suffers from the classic "precision/accuracy" problem. What we have are a lot of very, very precise terms with very, very well defined meanings which are as a result very, very hard to use properly.<br/><br/>It's almost like the Uncertainty principle: you can't know what a term means and when to apply it at the same time. You either say "my GM totally railroaded me" in which case you're not making a very specific complaint, but it's probably going to be relatively accurate, or you can say "my GM used Force in a dysfunctional manner that conflicted with my creative agenda" in which case you're making a very specific complaint which probably doesn't actually describe what happened in your game.                        </div>
