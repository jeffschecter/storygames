Let's just bathe in their abstractness for this thought experiment, okay?  <br/>In other words, please try not to nitpick "win" and "lose"; we get that it's a thing, that no one will likely be able to define for everyone, just with words(unless you're a poet).  It's a feeling.

The things I think of first are probably not quite games, depending on what definition of game you use, but in the spirit of not quibbling over definitions, how about Conway's Game of Life? (Costikyan would call it a toy, like Sim City.)<br/><br/>Ooh, Telestrations. I don't know the rules of the published Telestrations, but I played similar games on other forums, and there were no winners. Similarly, the whisper game.<br/><br/>How about games where potentially one can lose, but past a certain age it's trivial not to? Singing rounds, for instance, or playing Redneck Picnic or one of it's variants (My name is Adam, I'm from Arizona, and I work in advertising), etc. Or coloring, or connect the dots? I don't often think of coloring as a game, but there are definitely rules to it when you are a kid.<br/><br/>It's probably (definitely) an overextension of the Forge's Big Model, but I think maybe you could kind of map all game-like things in a similar three-fold way. Games where the point is the creation of a (possibly ephemeral) artifact of play (some singing games, coloring, cat's cradle, exquisite corpse), games where you are mostly finding out what happens when you do this or that (playing the Sims or the Game of Life, goofing around with most toys, Mad Libs), and games where you are competing to win, whether against yourself or others (Chess, Crossword Puzzles, most of the obvious things we think of as games besides RPGs).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437732/#Comment_437732" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T17:47:17+00:00" title="August 25, 2014  5:47PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tag is clearly a game, but you can't really win or lose.  At the end of recess, nobody tallied up how long you were It and decided that Bobby won because he was It for the shortest length of time.  Many other playground games are fairly similar.  Does anyone win Hide and Seek?  Foursquare?  These are generally games where you can do well or poorly on a moment-to-moment scale, but there is no winning or losing over all.  I Spy and 20 Questions and other waiting in line/riding in a car games often are like that as well.<br/><br/>Many of the games from the New Games movement don't have winning or losing exactly.<br/><br/><br/>"Eat Poop You Cat", like Exquisite Corpse, doesn't have a winner really, just a procedure to generate fun.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437733/#Comment_437733" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T18:00:04+00:00" title="August 25, 2014  6:00PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Floor Games, as per HG Wells.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist" title="amphigorist"><img alt="amphigorist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/877/nOZYIGACEOYYP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist">amphigorist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437736/#Comment_437736" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T18:40:40+00:00" title="August 25, 2014  6:40PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, Choose Your Own Adventure books and their modern Twine equivalents usually have desirable and undesirable endings, but you don't exactly win or lose.
