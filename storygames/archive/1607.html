                            Hey Clinton,<br/><br/>Very cool and thought-provoking link.<br/><br/>Chris Crawford hosts a yearly conference called Phrontisterion on the topic of "Interactive Storytelling" at his ranch in southern Oregon. Last year I got a very last minute invitation to it. Well, I couldn't make it on such short notice (and honestly I hadn't even heard of Crawford), but earlier this year I found my way (via <a href="http://gamasutra.com/features/20060612/murdey_01.shtml" rel="nofollow">this interview</a>  with him on Gamasutra) to the Storytron tutorial and damn if it didn't totally capture my interest. I combed it for a particular underlying mechanical correspondence to MLwM: does it provide for "verbs" getting easier or harder to use over the course of play, not based only on immediate circumstances, but also on what has gone before.<br/><br/>And I believe it does. Which is awesome.<br/><br/>Walt Freitag, who's familiar with Storytron and who's been to prior Phrontisteria, told me he thinks what Chris is trying to do is "audience as explorer." And I'd say that <em>My Life with Master</em>, and my own interest, is "audience as collaborator."<br/><br/>Except after plowing into the Storytron tutorial I realized exactly what I'd want to do with it. Multiplayer, and inspired by reality TV. Not solo exploration, wholly divorced from audience, but group creation of watchable events. Imagine an Apprentice-inspired multiplayer Storytron game, maybe about courtiers vying for political power. And the King and key NPCs are all Actors scripted by the engine.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Patrick Dugan, another former Phrontisterian, and game designer who's quite familiar with Storytron informs me that lack of multiplayer is one of Storytron's limitations, and that the community surrounding it is distinctly disinterested in "game" as a goal. Someone probably needs to show them the error of their ways.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

                            Chris Crawford is awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Storytron is a much more approachable title than "Erazmaganza."                        </div>

                            Actually Paul, I put the multiplayer notion before Chris and he said it is indeed feasible, since anyone can play any character (the data structures and scripting archetechture are interchangable). So what you describe could work, and should, I suspect that sort of content could do quite well when Storytron launches next year. <br/>
<br/>
Their aversion to the word "game" is primarily a marketing thing (which is stupid, its much easier to shift opinion of a saturated term than it is to bring a new term to saturation) and is secondarily a stubborn epistemological thing (I find categorical taxonomies of design space to be limited at best, the key difference with a "storyworld" is that goals are brought in by the player, rather than embedded. <br/>
<br/>
Storytron will have its niche audience of people who don't mind text (that is, the gross minority of the entertainment market, though still sizeable in terms of potential revenues) and is great for developers with low resources who also dig some text. I'd love to see some Paul Czege designs using the engine. <br/>
<br/>
I'm doing a poster session on first generation drama engines at GDC in March, one of the basic differences I'll be discussing is Generative vs. Emergent plot and Homogenous vs. Heterogenous characters. Storytron is a homogenous, generative system, while Facade uses a heterogenous, generative system. Tale of Tale's Drama Princess module is a homogenous emergent model, and my company will be developing a heterogenous, emergent engine. Audience as explored vs. audience as collaborator is probably another dichotomy, Facade is more collaborative (you can read papers describing their philosophy at their site) while Storytron is explorative, DP is explorative while Rocket Heart (the engine design I'm pursueing) is collaborative. <br/>
<br/>
Actually, maybe thats not an orthogonal axis, because homogenous characters (that is, characters derived from permuations on a data structure) tend to support exploratory behavior (explore how data permuations affect the social typography) while heterogenous characters (sculpted out of distinct algorithms) tend to support collaborative behavior (participate in the collective typography of social processes). <br/>
<br/>
How about this, another axis is interchangability. In Facade and DP the avatar is the player is the avatar, while in Storytron and RH the player could technically play any character, though the catch is you need to have content supporting a meaningful experience as a given PC.                        </div>
