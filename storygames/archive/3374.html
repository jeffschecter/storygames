Resolving the conflict actually gives you the waypoints to roleplaying the conflict.  <br/><br/>I don't see this too much, so I'm interested in the following:<br/><br/>1.  Games that successfully use fortune-at-the-beginning<br/>2.  Your thoughts on the perils and opportunities of completely front-loading conflict resolution<br/>3.

You roll the various dice in your cup and use them to inspire your narration; also, the result tells you whether to add or remove dice.<br/><br/>Example from the text: "If Pluto is the high die, add a Soldier die to your glass. And describe how<br/>the scene resolves itself with the commission of a crime.".<br/><br/>Note how the text is vague: "...with the commission of a crime" rather than, say,  "...with someone present being murdered". I think that's important. <br/><br/>Another game to look at is <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Terra_Nova.pdf" rel="nofollow">Terra Nova</a>, by one Robert Poppe. You draw cards, which inspire a scene of hardship between polar explorers.<br/><br/>This game, I think, is less successful. I personally feel it's because the rules are too restrictive: every scene is a hardship, revolving around either Discipline, Hope or Strength. For me, that'd be OK for a few scenes, but then things would start repeating. You don't see Robert Poppe around much these days, so perhaps he gave up after this game*.<br/><br/>Also, and this is <i>totally</i> irrational, I like Bacchanal's dice rolling, which seems elegant, as opposed to Terra Nova's card drawing, which seems too random. This preference of min makes <i>no</i> sense.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/><sup>* Robert Poppe is a pseudonym for Jason Morningstar</sup> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76369/#Comment_76369" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T07:27:46+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  7:27AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2007 7:29AM by timfire.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only two games that I know that use Fortune-in-the-Beginning techniques are <i>OtherKind </i>(by mr. lumpley) and <i>Bacchanal</i>.

Now, having not actually read or played Amber or Nobilis, Im going completely by guesswork here.<br/><br/>Kaare Berg wrote a scetch for a Karma system for his game Hero Chronicles(which is still in development,and the system I am referring to has been scrapped). That was the first time I encountered the possibility of deciding the outcome first, and then narrating/playing out the conflict.<br/><br/>The system worked much like Trollbabes reroll-system. By trying again, the character recieved  a bonus to his rating(a number between 1 and 10, if I remember correctlyfrom the examples he posted), at the price of different complications later in the story. A complication (which were more or less grabbed from Afraid) netted a +1 bonus, wounds a +2 bonus, incapacitation a +3 bonus and death a whopping +11 bonus. You had to take these complications in sequence.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a round of conflict, you compared your score to the opponents score, and the winner narrated the outcome. If you were defeated, you had the options of giving or escalating.<br/><br/>Thats the only meaningful contribution I could come up with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76373/#Comment_76373" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T07:33:56+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  7:33AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That Poppe guy is a total jack-hole, and as much as I love Terra Nova, it <i>does </i>need a complete re-write.

Just a sentence will do.<br/><br/>I love the concept of "Fortune in the Middle" (rolling dice, see the results, then narrating out how things got that way; like in Otherkind, and Kirt (forgot his last name)'s No Press Anthology take on WoD). But I just adopted the term "fortune in the middle" for this because that's what others called it. Never really had an understanding of why it was called such.  Looking at the above, it looks like Otherkind is actually "Fortune at the Beginning".  <br/><br/>Just looking for clarification, then I'll come back with some ideas once my head is straightened out.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76379/#Comment_76379" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T07:59:50+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  7:59AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2007 8:01AM by Robert_Bohl.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, can you define Fortune-at-the-Beginning?<br/><br/>EDIT: GMTA                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76381/#Comment_76381" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T08:08:06+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  8:08AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry guys, <br/><br/>Fortune = using some random element in resolution (as opposed to drama or karma or whatever).  In my case playing cards bid by players.<br/><br/>At the beginning = before the conflict is initiated or played out.  This is pretty rare, which is the point of the thread.  <br/>In the middle = usually after a decisive point of opposition has been reached mid-conflict.  Stake-setting systems often use this.<br/>At the end = after the action has been completed, just determining outcome. This is the traditional approach, I think.  <br/><br/>I may be using these terms incorrectly, who knows?  But those are the definitions I'm using for the purpose of this conversation.<br/><br/>So in Medical Hospital, it'll go like this:  Me and Joel have a scene together, which means we'll have a conflict.  We each put forward some cards from our hands.  It's a drama scene, I put forward more spades and win.  The specific cards I put forward point to situation elements.  Joel has the highest total card, so he uses those elements and frames the scene.  We roleplay it, knowing that my guy is going to get what he wants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76384/#Comment_76384" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T08:11:51+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  8:11AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, so it's not that thing where you roll, then look at the dice, then say what happens as a result (a la Dogs)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76386/#Comment_76386" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T08:17:01+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  8:17AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe Dogs is sort of extended fortune-in-the-middle in practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76389/#Comment_76389" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T08:26:01+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  8:26AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021108232016/http://www.septemberquestion.org/lumpley/other.html" rel="nofollow">[Here's the link for <i>OtherKind</i>]</a>.

Getting back on track:<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;1. Games that successfully use fortune-at-the-beginning<br/>So, if I got the terms right, you'll want to look at Pretender by Kirt Dankmeyer. It has either  FiB or early FiM. You basically go and play until you come to a point where you want to do something. At which point you roll a bunch of dice (2, 5, 12, or 99) and group the dice into sets any way you want, then assign them to 7-8 categories: Stuff like "Did you succeed? Did you take Damage? How 'cool/spectacular' was your success? How much did it influence hidden plot agendas? Who gets to narrate the outcome?" I can't remember all the columns, just that they were cool, and I pretty much stole that system wholesale for an early draft of The Ghost Killers ("Flip Mode", which I ended up recently discarding because even though I like it it just didn't fit what I wanted).<br/><br/>I would go as far as to say "it's stupid-easy to run: Find a copy and play or run it as a one shot some evening". That will show you some of the potential pitfalls.<br/><br/>2. Your thoughts on the perils and opportunities of completely front-loading conflict resolution<br/><br/>That if you don't think about how to bring in influence of other people, or actually inject "roleplay" into the conflict, then the conflict can probably end up looking like "The Die Roller's Story Hour":<br/><br/>"OK, so I succeed.

Techniques for making this cool, building tension, etc. <br/><br/>The end result is defined, but what is sacrificed/done along the way is not defined. That would replace the normal tension of "did I succeed or not?"<br/><br/>Making sure that one person becomes the Card Lord, with control over how the card are interpreted, so that you don't have a lot of back-and-forth bending and derailing by players. And make sure the others all roleplay it out, in character, even though the end result is revealed.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76400/#Comment_76400" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T09:09:40+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  9:09AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Andy!

High cards are more likely to win, but once you've won, high cards cause additional complications in the scene you've won, maybe lingering complications in future scenes, even.

It's a very strange concept. Basically you have to decide to have a resolution before you know what it is that you're trying to resolve. The only methods I've seen for this are typically scene-based. Like "At the beginning of each scene, roll the dice" then figure out what conflict is going on in the scene, then resolve it from the combination of the two effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne I could imagine is something like, "A player can spend a token to cause a conflict to occur. First roll the dice to see who wins. Then decide what it is that was at stake, and resolve."<br/>\n<br/>\nFitB exists pretty much because people discovered the existence of FitM as a response to FatE. But that's like saying that the McDonald's small fries must exist because there are medium and large size fries. Sure, one can conceptualize what it's like. But that's far from saying that it's a really useful idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is to say that I find it odd that people persue the idea as a design element just because it's been proposed as a fill-in on a spectrum. For instance, if they had come up with Fortune Before for FitM (refering to it being done before other mechanical manipulations) and Fortune After (refering to it being done after the other mechanical manipulations had occured), then we wouldn't even be having this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not to say that people shouldn't design such games. But it is to say that working off a terminological oddity is no way to come up with all of the possibilities. For instance, this spectrum also assumes things like narraton of the resolution comes after everything else. Maybe that can be turned on it's head? Or any other part of how resolutions may occur in a RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, largely, the two major paradigms here work just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76477/#Comment_76477" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T12:53:15+00:00" title="June 18, 2007 12:53PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Although it's not strictly related to conflict resolution, one could argue that the drawing of the cards at the beginning of each event in Roach is a form of FitB. The random element comes well before any scene framing, roleplay, or conflict setup, but still has (sometimes drastic) mechanical impact on how the scenes are played out and resolved. Again, not as intimately bound to each actual instance of resolution as a fistful of dice up front, but I can sort of see it if I squint. (Depending on how far you want to stretch the definition, of course - the same argument could be made for any number of pre-scene randomization, up to rolling for initial character statistics, but that's waaay too far for my liking.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76648/#Comment_76648" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T11:37:26+00:00" title="June 19, 2007 11:37AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Mike:</p>\n<p>To a certain extent, I agree.

The truly exciting new territory in RPGs is play structure; there's plenty of room for novelty there.</p>\n<p>But on the other hand, sometimes you need to do something more efficiently, or need to do something that hasn't been truly explored before. In those cases, you should explore new techniques if, in theory, they seem to fit the needs of what you need to accomplish.</p>\n<p>I think that, if you are talking about <em>resolution</em>, you are completely correct about FitM and FatE being sufficient for everything. However, if you are talking about rolling dice/drawing cards for something, like generation (as I suggested,) FitB is perfectly fine and may in fact be a better fit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent" title="GrimGent"><img alt="GrimGent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent">GrimGent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77104/#Comment_77104" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T08:31:10+00:00" title="June 22, 2007  8:31AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Temple: <i>"Well, Fortune-at-the-Beginning is a neccessary component (or atleast a possibility) of Karma-based systems like Amber and Nobilis.
