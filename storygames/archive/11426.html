This work is licenses under a Creative Commons non-commercial share-alike license so you should know that you can probably find it for free before you decide to pay for it. This is a simple, 34-page system-free setting that explores a few ideas that smacked into me at once:<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you make any money giving something away?<br/>\nDoes my little framework for settings make settings?<br/>\nIs the interface between system and setting what I think it is?<br/>\nHow does system affect play when you use different systems in the same setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaytesting gave me some answers. The rest I hope will be forthcoming. Enjoy, whether you pay or find it for free. Please give it the hell away if you buy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the intro:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe world of Deluge is our world, perhaps a hundred years after an event that changed it forever. Since that time, the world has been under a constant rainfall. Civilization as we know it has crumbled, slowly at first, but more rapidly as the rain destroyed those aspects of our world that we had thought most secure: our agriculture and our trade. The water level has risen, the temperature has risen, and all too rapidly to react to. And no one claims any more that this was all our fault, because we know whose fault it was. There are no ice caps, but we didn\u2019t melt them. The world is a jungle of sorts, but we didn\u2019t let that grow. The world is now slowly taking the shape that they prefer, and a day will come when they are ready to take possession.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd some of the people of this sodden world intend to be ready for that day. You will play Deluge in your home town. After all, you know it well and you\u2019re in a better position than I am to imagine what that town would be like with fifteen meters of new water and under constant rain. Some cities, of course, are less interesting in this [2] regard as they are well above that altitude. If you live far inland, you may have more fun setting your game (to begin with at least) somewhere closer to the coast where a rise in sea level will have a dramatic effect and let you create evocative maps easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeluge is system-free but there will be places throughout that imply systemic choices. I\u2019ll highlight these because if you intend to fit Deluge into your preferred system, these are the places where the work might be. Sometimes that work will be identifying analogous mechanism -- your system does the same thing but uses a different term. Sometimes that work will require new mechanism and where this seems likely, I\u2019ll try to point towards a fruitful path. Sometimes you\u2019ll have to hack through jungle yourself for it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254419/#Comment_254419" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T02:31:59+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  2:31AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good luck.

I'm thinking about publishing various things through PDF so I want to explore that. There's also a game design experiment in this but that's not what anyone is asking about. So.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to sell PDFs.<br/>\nI want a GM that buys my PDF to give it to his players.<br/>\nIf I give a gift, I should just give that gift and not pretend to regulations I can't enforce.<br/>\nSo DRM doesn't do anything for me.<br/>\nPDFs get pirated anyway.<br/>\nSo -- I offer the PDF for sale and with the sale give the owner a license to basically share to her heart's content. I make no effort to police or persuade who and how.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I am interested in is whether or not anyone would buy something that can be shared for free. If not, then the whole idea of selling PDFs seems unstable, either ethically or economically or both. If so, then that's cool. So I built something that I think is worth the money, gave it a license that makes it sharable without interesting burden, and put it up for sale.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that this method essentially codifies what most PDF sellers are doing anyway, there's just some mileage in not saying it out loud.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254581/#Comment_254581" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T16:21:27+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  4:21PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2010 4:24PM by buzz.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bought a copy (Lulu discount and all), FWIW.
