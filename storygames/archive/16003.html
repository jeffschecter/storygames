I am a nerd and enjoy those types of stories, but I have never got how that world would work. Yes I know I should suspend my disbelief for the sake of fun and story, but there is just way too much belief being suspended.  Why isn't everyone a super? How do buildings get rebuilt so fast? I mean in most super hero stories I have read, the heroes would be the greatest terrorist threat the world has ever seen, if they existed in our world. <br/><br/>Since we are making our own world, help me with some conceptual ideas on how to make one that works.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364552/#Comment_364552" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T07:02:31+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  7:02AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a whole subsection of supers which rewrites the conceits of superhero comics so that they can pretend to realism.

The big thing about superhero settings is that you can have two but not three of superheroes, internal consistency, and a world that looks anything like ours.  <br/><br/>The traditional Marvel/DC style universe has 1 and 3, at the cost of just handwaving away or deliberately ignoring any of the logical effects of decades of superhero activity (Mr. Fantastic has had a flying car since 1963, but that technology never made it out to the public at large, the public doesn't believe in alien life even though Galactus and the Skrulls have invaded publicly, multiple times, and so on).  The other direction, as seen most famously in Watchmen (and the Godlike supplement for Wild Talents), is to actually let these things have consequences on the world, and basically turn things into an alternate history.<br/><br/>It sounds like you might be happiest going the alt-history route.  There is kind of a way to cheat this; if your PCs are basically the first superhumans that exist, you can get a grace period where the world has not yet been wrung out of recognizable shape by superhuman activity (and some superhero comics go this way; even Marvel and DC started out that way, really), but eventually you're either going to have to be comfortable with the world making big changes, or just handwaving things.  Since you're using Microscope for setup, you're going to hit this point even faster, since there's nothing stopping you from jumping up and down the timeline.<br/><br/>If for some reason your group can't go alt-history, but you still want at least some fig leaf for why society hasn't been totally distorted, there's always the McGuffin route; some piece of handwavium physically or socially prevents superpowers from acting globally.  White Wolf's Mage presupposed that public disbelief prevents magic from working or makes it backlash horribly (so supers/sorcerers duel in the shadows conspiratorially, and the nature of their own powers is such that public evidence can never exist and destroys anyone who acts on a vast scale), and DC Comics' explanation for why Superman didn't kill Hitler is that the Nazis had a magical artifact that instantly brainwashed anyone with superpowers who entered Axis-held territory.<br/><br/>Actually, if you can get a hold of it, the Wild Talents rulebook (not the Essential Edition, the hardcover version) has a really great chapter by Ken Hite on superhero worldbuilding.  However, it does not solve the fundamental "realism" problem of the genre, merely examines it and provides options for how to approach it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364567/#Comment_364567" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T07:35:54+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  7:35AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might also want to see the movie Chronicle, which just came out and might still be in theaters in your area.

But <i>generally</i> they'll fall in these categories, and that helps keep the superhero population relatively in check. Normal people can't just go get themselves doused in any old radiation and expect to get superpowers.<br/><br/>And, when you think about it, superpowered individuals <i>are</i> the greatest terrorist threat in the Marvel universe, whether alien invasions, mutant incursions, Dr. Doom coming along and trying to conquer New York, Galactus trying to eat the planet, etc. The super <i>heroes</i> are the equivalent, then, of the soldiers and intel agents trying to fight the terrorists and extremists of the real world.<br/><br/>Of course, trying to figure out the physics of it all is not worth the battle. It ain't gonna work.<br/><br/>As for rebuilding buildings that get destroyed, comic after comic, a lot of comics really don't have explanations for that. Instead, I would reference the old supers RPG <b>Underground</b>. There, supers were all super-soldiers who now try to make it on their own, for better or for worse. Buildings would get destroyed so often, they actually would build them from giant, LEGO-like, prefabricated bricks. Knock down a building, and you can rebuild it fairly quickly. It also had a lot of cool stuff about side effects, as well as donating human bodies as food (okay, maybe not so much cool as weird).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364578/#Comment_364578" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T07:48:28+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  7:48AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 8:01AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thadrine</cite>Yeah, I want 1 and 2.<br/>I definitely do not want anything that looks like our world.</blockquote>\nAwesome.  I don't actually think that's going to be hard, then!  Assuming that the rest of the group is also totally on board with just following the consequences wherever they may lead (it's probably a really good idea to explicitly get that out in the open-- a lot of people specifically DON'T want that in their superheroes), just playing Microscope should get you where you want.  The Palette step of Microscope is a really powerful tool for getting everyone on the same page before the game begins, and the suspension of disbelief clash only comes about when you disbelieve in certain genre conventions but don't actually get rid of them.  <br/><br/>If you want some specific pointers for directions a no-holds-barred superverse might go, definitely try and check out that chapter from the Wild Talents main book, and the Progenitor setting for the same game (I meant Progenitor and not Godlike in my last post, oops).<br/><br/>I also got beaten to the punch on mentioning Underground, but honestly I don't think it's actually what you're looking for-- it's a dark-humored parody of superheroes and militarism, and not actually realistic.  Top Ten is also fundamentally a parody-- it gets most of its mileage from putting totally unrealistic superheroes with into mundane police procedural storylines.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the comic Planetary also plays around with the question of "why hasn't this world choked full of weirdness developed into something strange?" and comes up with the answer of "because the Fantastic Four are artificially stagnating technology for their own benefit and vanity, and have been secretly killing off or co-opting any threats to their secret rule".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364582/#Comment_364582" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T08:01:51+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  8:01AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 8:04AM by thadrine.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe McGuffin</cite><br/>On the other hand, the comic Planetary also plays around with the question of "why hasn't this world choked full of weirdness developed into something strange?" and comes up with the answer of "because the Fantastic Four are artificially stagnating technology for their own benefit and vanity, and have been secretly killing off or co-opting any threats to their secret rule".</blockquote>\nPlanetary is the reason why I felt that this could actually work for me.

What's the time frame between issues or story arcs?  It's mostly not stated.  Also, unless it's somehow key to the story or theme, having the heroes walk/fly past a the ruins of a previous supers fight is just a distraction from the story at hand.  You can safely assume that the heroes either took a different street, or they passed that wreckage in a panel that wasn't shown.<br/><br/>While these things might matter in the exploration of a Microscope game, MHR is, as has been said, not a superhero game, but a comic book game.  The comics don't worry about it, so neither should you for your MHR game.

A few insights indirectly from Mr. Morrison:<br/><br/>Superheroes are to some degree heir to the storytelling niche of legends and folktales. The idea of continuity caters to a small vocal audience, but they may not be the best way to just tell a supers story.<br/><br/>This may seem obvious, but even within superhero comics the genres are limitless. It sounds like you're interested in the 90's/00's style reaction to Watchmen and The Dark Knight where heroes are cast into a realistic world. I'm thinking Stormwatch, The Authority, Ultimates, etc. I'm not sure those stories are really a great fit for supers, but that's my personal opinion. I would tend to go more towards the mythic end of the spectrum and just avoid questions about how this all works and detailed history.<br/><br/>Now speaking for myself: the idea of 'realism' is like a virus in comics. At best it leads to a stronger bread (see Watchmen, Dark Knight) but 95% of the time it just kills.<br/><br/>That said, here are a few tried and true comics solutions:<br/><br/>The superhero cleanup/repair team, as seen in Irredeemable Ant Man. Sure those buildings get knocked down all the time but there are other superheros waiting to rebuild.<br/><br/>Government sanctioned heroes, as in Stormwatch and The Ultimates. Superheroes are seen as a threat, but there are some working for the status quo too.<br/><br/>Superheroes as government, as in The Authority. Superheroes may be hated by the reactionary world governments but what can they do about it, anyway?<br/><br/>The supercity, for example post-Braniac Metropolis or Top 10. Superheroes for one reason or another end up in one area which is more or less resilient to their powers.<br/><br/>One-source powers, a la New Universal. There is only one (or maybe two) sources of power in the world, usually unpredictable and limited. In New Universal it was literally a flash of light with unknown origins. Now some people have powers (and a few others have powerful technology that can stand up to them).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those are all solutions if you want 'realism' but I'm not sure that's the game Marvel is really meant to play. In a lot of ways you're not playing Superheroes anymore, you're playing the reactionary deconstruction of superheroes. But hey, your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>My personal approach (since you asked for that, right? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ) would be to read some un-apollogetically superhero comics and, if I like them, play Marvel. If I don't, maybe the game I actually want to play is something else. Suggestions: All Star Superman, Invincible, Ultimate Spiderman, Wolverine and the X-Men, New X-Men, Daredevil (the current Mark Waid one), Astonishing X-Men (Whedon). Out of all of those only Invincible spends much thought on the superhero aspect and even then it pretty much goes with "there are enough superpowered people of all stripes that it evens out" approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364657/#Comment_364657" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T13:10:15+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  1:10PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Start small. <br/>Build relationships.<br/>Don't build a world.

But I'll give you answers from the genre.<br/><br/><b>Why isn't everyone a super?</b> Because it takes extraordinary circumstances to be super. Like being the survivor from another planet. Or so bent on revenge that you dedicate your entire life to self-improvement (and, I suspect, were also fortunate enough to have great genes that make it possible). You got a super-serum and the formula was destroyed and can't be recreated. You got hit with the right amount of radiation/chemicals/experimental spiders/cosmic rays that either can't be duplicated, or have so many variables that it's almost impossible to duplicate.<br/><br/><b>How do buildings get rebuilt so fast?</b> Because the writers ignore the damage. Because buildings don't get damaged that often - big battles are often damage free. Maybe a smashed window or light pole, but the buildings don't take significant structural damage that would take a long time to fix, they're usually about as damaging as your average riot. Because there are super beings who work in construction. They don't have powers useful in fighting threats or heroism, but they can fix the Chrysler building in 24 minutes flat. Because the heroes themselves lend a hand after almost every fight. Or, they don't: Stories don't take place in the same part of the city. It took months to rebuild that neighborhood, and we just didn't tell any stories there. People put up with it because the costs out weight the damages (imagine how bad the city would be if Superman <i>ignored</i> the 300 foot tall robot of desctruction). Or people don't put up with it, and you're right, heroes spend a lot of time fighting the establishment and angering the general populace and forces of the status quo. Or further, the heroes are seen as outright threats and actively hunted. Laws are passed to register them, chemicals and machines are created to try and remove their powers permanently, and most people wish they'd just go away for good. Maybe they are terrorists by any government definition, because they are working against the governments and trying to make the world a better place for the common person (i.e. They are the 0.000000001% and they've made it their goal to make it a paradise for the 99% - or at least, what they <i>think</i> is a paradise).<br/><br/>Wild Talents is a great supers RPG, even if you use MSHRP, there's a big section on figuring out how your world might work. It covers variables like:<br/>History: Do histories shape history and society, or do they cancel each other out and end up being invisible?<br/>Society &amp; Roles: Do superbeings fall into hero and villain roles, or do they take up other jobs, maybe even becoming celebrities and creating entertainment genres?<br/>Weirdness: Are superpowers the only weird thing, or is there other stuff, and how weird does it get?<br/><br/>That section is written by Ken Hite and it's well worth the cover price.  I'm not familiar with microscope, but this could give you a framework to start with, or give you and your players a whole host of potential answers so that you can forge your own path.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364664/#Comment_364664" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T13:28:50+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  1:28PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thadrine</cite>Planetary is the reason why I felt that this could actually work for me.

I've been in two extremely disappointing games of Necessary Evil that were pitched as superheroes (well, semi-reformed villains), but the setting is really about a fairly grim guerrilla war that basically has nothing at all to do with superheroes or supervillains.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364680/#Comment_364680" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T14:04:08+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  2:04PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, and my thought is, based on my reading, that Marvel is about Superheroes, not just people with superpowers.

The government rounds them up and so they all grow bonds together during school years.

It explores a lot of their social connections, as some of them have clearly A-list powers and others do not.

Then The Man/big media/bloggers/whomever step up, decry the violence, and we end up with things like the institutionalized mutant bigotry in X-Men.<br/><br/>What I think I've never seen in print is a general public whose attitudes have shifted in response to the presence of somewhat-more-common-than-OK-City supers' destructiveness. That, to my mind, might look like growing up in Beirut or Bosnia. But straight-up, non-experimental DC/Marvel style supers stories seem to rely on the general population looking and acting just like the real world, only the damage doesn't matter, the politics don't matter, widespread public sentiment doesn't (really) matter. It seems important to genre conventions that the world never change, because it provides contrast and context to what we're supposed to be paying attention to: the big fights.<br/><br/>I think it'd be super (!) interesting to see a story that's basically about normal people in a world dealing with the fallout of superbeings going apeshit on each other, and the supers are never even really characters.

A bunch of indies, too.<br/><br/>In general, superheroes have been deconstructed every which way, so much so that we already went through a short reconstruction, and are now back into reconstruction, all through the last 20 years.

Although it would sure be interesting to see the superhero comic where every other issue is de/reconstructive.<br/><br/>Oh, I guess <i>Star Man</i> did that already.

A tiny number of people have extraordinary powers, either from a shared "origin event" or uniquely bizarre circumstances.  Superhumans.  [This is the part where I really have to do some heavy lifting to suspend my disbelief.]<br/><br/>2.  Of those superhumans, some decide that they're going cash in by any means necessary. If no bullets can harm you, and you can fly faster than a jet fighter, why not just do whatever the fuck you want, and who cares about the consequences?  Super villains. (Not every superhuman would behave this way, but for most it's probably just one really bad week away.)<br/><br/>3.  The police can catch a killer with sustained effort; the DEA can bust a drug conspiracy with sustained effort; the CIA can drone-kill a terrorist with sustained effort.  Who do you call when somebody mind-controls all of Allentown, Pennsylvania and tells them to commit mass suicide?  Or steals Fort Knox?  Or transmutes Mayor Bloomberg into Mayor McCheese?  The regular authorities are slow, clueless, and possibly corrupted.  Somebody is going to try to solve those cases, and quickly, because it's an emergency.  Super heroes.<br/><br/>4.  So the deal is that if you're a superhuman, your very existence is severely screwed up by the presence of other superhumans!  There are assholes running around blowing stuff up, and other assholes running around as the self-appointed police, with all the problems associated with vigilantism and posses in the Old West.  Meanwhile regular people fear you, admire you, mock you, and lust after you.  If you ever want to live a normal life, you're going to have to strive like hell for it.  <i>Go!</i><br/><br/>(This doesn't get you to silly costumes, secret identities, or super hero code names, but it's the beginning of a pretty solid sandbox I think.)<br/><br/>It looks like <i>Marvel Heroic</i> doesn't especially stress crime-fighting or world-saving.  All of that stuff depends on how you've written your Milestones.  If you want to earn XP for getting rich and having three-ways, go for it.  Eventually, someone is going to start messing with you--how far will you go when pushed?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364978/#Comment_364978" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T22:52:44+00:00" title="March  3, 2012 10:52PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I think it'd be super (!) interesting to see a story that's basically about normal people in a world dealing with the fallout of superbeings going apeshit on each other, and the supers are never even really characters. More like...forces of nature, I guess. Has that story been told in print? I don't follow nearly enough titles to know one way or the other.</blockquote>\nThe Marvel comics miniseries "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War:_Front_Line" rel="nofollow">Front Line</a>," that was part of the Civil War event, was a little like this. Reporters digging around for the truth amid the cataclysm.<br/><br/>The inciting incident of Civil War, actually, is a great example of superhero shenanigans A) causing a horrifying death toll ( the most unbelievable thing for ME about comics is that all those buildings are somehow always uninhabited) and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> precipitating a commensurate response from the public and the government.<br/><br/><br/>So, the <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2011/06/12/microscope/" rel="nofollow">the first Microscope game I played</a> had a premise along these lines. We used one of the seed concepts in the book: "Costumed superheroes fight crime, subverting the rule of law." The starting era was "The night no one remembers," after which many people discover they have superpowers. The ending <br/>period was "Civilization collapses into tribes led by superbeings." So there was our answer to "can superheroes exist and have the world still look recogizably like our own," at least in the long run. We never explored this end of the timeline really, and never established any hints as to how far in the future this would occur.<br/><br/>The events and scenes we actually played were situated mostly in the 30s and the 80s, being the first, optimistic superhero boom, and the rise of government-deputized superbeings, respectively. We were definitely inspired by Moore, not to mention Busiek (Astro City). And a little nod to Lovecraft: superheroes secretly all derive their powers from a strange underworldly source lurking under the sea. In the 40s this intelligence takes control of the supers and causes them to rampage mindlessly across Europe.<br/><br/>We had a suffragette heroine leading a march and getting gunned down by National Guard troops. The dashing gentleman hero of the 30s ruining his career by coming out as gay. The future first openly super President of the United States confronting his blackmailer before going public about his power. An Oklahoma City/Waco-type incident which sparked the push for a Superhero Deputization Act. A mysterious organization called The Club moving behind the scenes to keep a lid on what they know about the malevolent source of superpowers. It was great fun and hit all the right deconstruction notes.<br/><br/>Just a datapoint, a model to show one way this could turn out, and a damn fun story to tell.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365115/#Comment_365115" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T15:51:21+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  3:51PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Warren Ellis' Mavel series newuniversal is interesting -it depicts a completely mundane world in which a four or five people suddenly gain superpowers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365156/#Comment_365156" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T20:24:16+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  8:24PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2012 8:24PM by Nathan_H.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Universe" rel="nofollow">New Universe</a> thing was done in the eighties.
