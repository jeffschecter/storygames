I love <i>Apocalypse World</i> and I'd like to hack it for a dark fantasy setting I have in mind. My only problem is how to do it in such a way that the players are able to retain their characters for the full-length of large campaigns (i.e. the kind of globe-spanning fare where your character starts out as a pig farmer and ends up eventually confronting the God-Wizard of the Nine Voids). AW seems basically structured so that characters have a more-or-less complete arc in 12-15 sessions, at which point they max out and (theoretically) get retired or that story ends. But is there a way to adjust the advancements so it would reflect an epic-scale campaign that would last a year or two?<br/><br/>Sure, upping the number of marked experience boxes needed to gain the next advancement is one option, and would emphasize the concept of scarcity in the game, but would there be any specific mechanical drawbacks to doing that? Also, there are built in limitations with that option. You can only up the amount of marked experience so much before it makes advances ridiculously unattainable.<br/><br/>Also, I was thinking of multiple unlockable tiers for advancements (instead of just the one), but they would would have to be written really carefully in order that the game wouldn't get structurally unbalanced\u2014a hard thing to do when you're dealing with characters who could end up with more than double the number of advancements of those approaching the end-game of straight-up AW. Is there a way to address that potential power-imbalance?<br/><br/>Thoughts? Thanks in advance for anyone's input on the matter.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309936/#Comment_309936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T13:15:33+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  1:15PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've thought about slowing XP but only for the "advanced moves" or whatever. <br/><br/>Also, I've considered doing something like "advanced playbooks" for a hack I'm working on - playbooks only opened up for your second character. <br/><br/>However, you could do advanced playbooks to replace "change your playbook". <br/><br/>So, you start with Pig Farmer, then once you've advanced enough you can take Warrior Dude, and then once you've advanced that enough, up it to Knight of the Realm or whatever. <br/><br/>That gives you "tiered" play, like you're talking about.

I mean, even the basic game does it. First you're a driver and ride around a lot, then you settle down and become a hardholder until it all burns down and you wander the desert and drink from a weird spring and start opening your brain...the thing here is, I think, that your story, your positioning needs to take a turn, you become a person with many lives, more or less on the same level which means characters usually retire sooner or later, but the game can always go on.<br/><br/>The kind of zero-to-hero fantasy campaign you're aiming at has a different progression agenda. Instead of this flat landscape where lives change but never truly rise outside it (for then the game kind of ends), the fantasy arc has us pursuing the level-up treadmill of experience grinding and endless power-ups (which often seem pointless because the world levels up with us).<br/><br/>So, where was I...oh, yes. Yeah, tiers. Maybe try it like this:<br/><br/>Get a "party sheet" on which collective XP is marked. When everyone in the group has collectively gained [some arbitrary number] of XP or advances, move on to the next tier of the campaign. Each tier unlocks new playbooks, fronts, moves, locations, etc.<br/>Once the PCs are on tier 2, all the threats they had previously faced on tier 1 are beneath them. When you roll against someone or something from a lower tier, you cannot get a miss result. If you roll 6-, you get to pick a 7-9 result instead (7-9 is 10+, 10+ is 12+). Against tier 2 threats things work normally. <br/>If you ever meet something from a higher tier, you take -1 ongoing vs them or something.<br/><br/>If you have three or four tiers, that's enough for 30-60 sessions. Considering the average weekly session cycle of play, that's a year of serious regular play at least.<br/><br/>Btw, have you looked at Dungeon World? That has a longer XP bar and 10 levels (I think).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309947/#Comment_309947" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T13:56:40+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  1:56PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are some nifty ideas, indeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309951/#Comment_309951" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T14:04:54+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  2:04PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael's idea is kind of fun.

I'm actually just getting to the end of my first AW campaign, which has lated somewhere in the neighbourhood of 15 sessions and it's gotten REALLY EPIC, but it's also REALLY EPIC in this one corner of the world. I like the idea of long-term campaigns where everything works up to a WORLD-SHAKING climax. Correct me if I'm wrong, but AW seems better suited to relate stories that completely shake up the region the characters happen to occupy (I know there can be larger repercussions, but it seems more localized). I'm looking to build a game where the characters will eventually be able to take on their world's Sauron. I'm not saying that couldn't be done in a standard AW-length campaign, but I want more of a slow build.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309956/#Comment_309956" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T14:42:39+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  2:42PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: theg33k</cite>I like the idea of long-term campaigns where everything works up to a WORLD-SHAKING climax.

I think that's an excellent summation of what Apocalypse World is effective at doing, out of the box.<br/><br/>So, it strikes me that your biggest barrier in creating the WORLD-SHAKING, SAURON-KILLING climax isn't the rate at which characters advance. It's the fact that in AW, there are no status quo's. Everything is shifting and versatile, tides of control that quickly ebb.<br/><br/>What you want is some kind of mechanic/system to say, at a certain point, "Actually, there are status quos. Sauron rules Mordor, and is slowly eating up all neighboring lands. Actually, there are status quos. Gondor is an empty echo of its former glory, its royal lineage displaced."<br/><br/>So, Fronts are all about shifting power dynamics and fundamental scarcities, right? You want to start with Fronts, and have the characters contending with those things. But at some point, maybe around session 12 or so, you want to introduce some other kind of thing - a Not-Front. And whatever you call these Not-Fronts (Stases, Quests, Wars, Truths, Empires, etc), they function differently. They aren't about fundamental scarcities, but are instead about forms of oppression. They're about fixed and unwavering power dynamics, and the pains people endure as a result of those things.<br/><br/>Let's say you call them Empires.<br/><br/>Mechanically, maybe Empires look like this: instead of Threats, they have Blocks (as in: power blocks; as in: you're blocked from entering; as in: building blocks). Each Block is a certain unwavering power dynamic, and is tied to a tool of oppression: fear, might, rhetoric, withholding, decimation, possession, etc. And the countdown clocks work differently, a bit: they function like hit points for the Block: that power dynamic is unwavering until about 9:00, and is only toppled at 12:00.<br/><br/>In addition to custom move options, you can assign Defenses to Blocks. Maybe one or two to each Block, and Defenses are situations where the PCs are going to be at a disadvantage. One Empire might be Mordor, and one Block might be "The Black Iron Gates." That Block has two Defenses: "Impenetrably by the Armies of Men" and "Guarded By The Eye." Whenever the PCs attack/interact with a Block and its Defenses apply, the PCs are at a -1 disadvantage to all their rolls. If you're leading an army of men to siege the Black Iron Gates, you're doing so at a -2. Yikes!<br/><br/>The more I type, the more exciting this idea is to me.<br/><br/>You keep Fronts, but you also introduce Empires. They're different. They're about control, and stasis, and status quo.<br/><br/>Each Empire consists of Blocks, which have Defenses in addition to their Custom Moves.<br/>Zing! World-shaking is now ready to commence, as there is a concrete world to shake up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309957/#Comment_309957" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T14:57:50+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  2:57PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2011 3:01PM by sage.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's something beyond Dungeon World. When you reach level 10, your Campaign Front may conclude, but there are bigger things awaiting. Ask Adam about it.<br/><br/>For us, that's the shift point. Dungeon World is a game about becoming a force in the world. Taking on Dungeon Fronts to eventually make an impact in the Campaign Front. Then, in whatever's beyond, you are a force in the world(s).<br/><br/>Tiers of advancement have worked well for us. I think it works better with a large number of available moves though.<br/><br/>I also wouldn't worry too much about the pace of levelling slowing. There's time-honored design behind that. If it really bothers you, maybe something like this: each time you fill the advancement bar, you get a minor move and mark a level checkbox. When you mark a number of level checkboxes equal to the level you want to gain, you gain a level, get a major move, and erase your level checks.<br/><br/><br/>Our idea of Sauron is a little different from Joe's. Because Sauron's not really a status quo, right? He's a guy, with an agenda. He's a Power-mad Wizard, with an impulse to seek magical power (in DW terms). But he's also got this smaller plots going on, like sending orcs to Helmsdeep, and using Wormtongue to poison the mind of the king of Rohan. The way I look at that, is like there's this big, overriding, Front, and smaller Fronts that are kind of like the threats of that Front. Sauron's like a Front of Fronts.<br/><br/>I think this is how a lot of classic big campaign adventures work. You're not the guys who finally decide to take on the giants in the Frozen Fields, the giants in the Frozen Fields are being driven out by some worse evil. The status quo isn't the thing being challenged.<br/><br/>Sauron as the established badguy, who's got what he wants, is kind of a different game. I think there's less drama there, since he's not a threat to the players. He's already doing bad stuff, which means the PCs have to be the only source of action. Not as cool, in my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309959/#Comment_309959" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T15:00:41+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  3:00PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>Sauron's like a Front of Fronts.</blockquote>\nOr (he says, giggling), maybe he's like the Back to all the Fronts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309960/#Comment_309960" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T15:04:21+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  3:04PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hehehehehe.<br/><br/>Joe I really like the Empires idea.<br/><br/>Incidentally, sage, when's the new pdf of Dungeon World coming out?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theg33k" title="theg33k"><img alt="theg33k" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/7043/fil31771.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theg33k">theg33k</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309961/#Comment_309961" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T15:12:24+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  3:12PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooooooooh.

One idea I did have, though, was setting them up as the behind-the-scenes villains in the campaign. i'd feed them intel on what the PCs were doing and they'd respond accordingly. So.<br/><br/>What if the PCs started in their AW-like hamlet. Maybe the PCs collaboratively built it at the start of the game, like in Storming the Wizard's Tower. Life is crap. The Evil Overlord exists on the horizon and even though his thumb isn't directly pressing down on the PCs, no one is free of his influence. They spend their days trying to eke out an existence and cope with the minor-league warlords and general problems in their lives in a standard AW way. BUT.<br/><br/>There are another group of PCs (long-distance or not) who have been building the Armies of Darkness (stop-motion animated or not--haha) and establishing their over-arcing plans in the realm. All of this is happening simultaneously.<br/><br/>Then, at around the 12-session point or so, the fist of the Armies of Darkness comes down on the PCs' village/region and the characters are suddenly forced to step up to the plate as Empires are introduced. Then it turns into a direct struggle as the groups are pitted against each other FOR THE FATE OF THE WORLD!<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I know there are some inherent difficulties with this model, not the least of which is that the Armies of Darkness would have somewhat of a lesser role mechanically and would be essentially working toward losing (assuming things went well for the heroes), but if that's specified up-front I think it could be a really cool dynamic. And if you don't have the ability to form a second group (either online or IRL), the characters could create their own adversaries, a la My Life With Master or Minions Inc. But I think there's something workable hidden in here.<br/><br/>And I'll talk to Adam about post-Level 10 DW. Now I'm curious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309971/#Comment_309971" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T17:08:04+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  5:08PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, I liked your first bit about the status quos<br/><br/>Write down the statements, and put each one on a card.

With a little bit of fiddling, it would be easy to think of playbooks more like, uh, lifepaths in Burning Wheel or whatever-you-call-them in Warhammer Fantasy.  Bits of knowledge and experience that you accumulate and -- as long as you keep learning and adventuring and don't just settle down somewhere -- you can keep going.<br/><br/>Joe's also right that you'd have to change the way you frame Fronts and the campaign arc a bit, but not too much, really.  Sauron can just be a Front, right?  He's just a Front that starts out being narratively distant from the character's location and ability to deal with when the game begins.  But after many, many sessions, far away, inaccessible, and invulnerable Fronts and Threats become close, intimate, and vulnerable.  You see what I'm saying?  There are ways to make this work without scaling the power level dramatically, slowing down XP, or getting up into +6 stats that totally break the mechanics of AW.<br/><br/>Things don't have to become <i>quantitatively better</i> (or more dangerous, etc.) over the course of play, they can just become <i>qualitatively different</i>.  And because you follow the fiction in AW, if somebody says "I go aggro on Sauron," then the MC goes "How do you do that?" and sometimes the answer is, "Uh, I guess I can't do that now." So maybe it just takes an entire campaign to arrange the fictional circumstances such that you can say "I go aggro on Sauron by tossing the One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom" and <i>that immediately makes perfect, obvious sense to everyone as something you can do</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309998/#Comment_309998" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T22:38:44+00:00" title="January 27, 2011 10:38PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.

I've spent the past couple of hours writing notes and defining exactly what it is I want the game to do on both an emotional and mechanical level. Everyone's made fantastic points and I think I'm going to spend a day or so just ruminating over them and straightening them out in my mind. (Don't take that as me saying that I want the conversation to not continue, because I don't.)<br/><br/>And while I will say that upon further consideration my idea of having an opposing team of PCs playing the opposition was ill-formed and doesn't logically work or fit in anywhere (it was born out of excitement and good intentions and I still want to do something with it, just not here), I genuinely love the idea of a player-created opponent. I think that at the beginning of play the PCs should work to create their own adversary (in broad strokes), which the GM would then flesh out more over the course of the game. It would be nice to watch the players realize over the course of the campaign that they, in some small way, created the monster they are facing.<br/><br/>Okay, off to think now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310016/#Comment_310016" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T05:39:28+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  5:39AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first thought would be to make it generational - once your guy gets to the point where he's ready to retire to safety, his son, cup-bearer or protege takes on the mantle of hero.

Sauron's remote and distant but still a Front. He's a Campaign Front. He has all kinds of spells, servitors, and repercussions that the PCs can face directly. They're Dungeon Fronts.<br><br>From the OP, I'm not sure how much of the typical fantasy RPG experience you want, but there's plenty of space for becoming quantitatively better without breaking the roll+X, 6-,7-9,10+ system. Adding extra options to moves that make you choose, allowing an extra choice, allowing a choice even on failure, increasing hold, changing the dynamics of who gets to make a certain choice (like spending Hold from persuade). <br><br>J-Walt's right, you can rely on the fictional basis, and that works, especially for Lord of the Rings. But if you're shooting for the classic long campaign RPG play, quantitative improvement is a bit of a genre trope. In Lord of the Rings, Frodo can go aggro because he's fictionally positioned to do so, he hasn't improved as a character per se. In the long run campaign, the halfling thief can take down the evil overlord because he's learned the shadow secrets of the nether realm and had the ability to strike even unto the heart of darkness, so he's powerful enough to get past the elite guards the surround the overlord, and he's also dealt with many of the overlord's plots to drive back his influence. Neither's wrong and both are workable.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310051/#Comment_310051" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T09:07:15+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  9:07AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to chime in:<br><br>My thought was exactly the same as those above talking about the fiction. I didn't get the sense in Lord of the Rings that any character actually grew in power: they just grew in courage.<br/><br/>The hobbits didn't topple Sauron because they got Killer Stats, but because they figured out a risky plan that <i>just might work</i>.<br/><br/>I think I would enjoy a game where your influence grows because you learn more about the world, and your knowledge and understanding allows you to find leverage over your enemies: maybe it's occult secrets, maybe it's your ability to convince two mighty Kings to drop their pointless war and actually unite against the bigger threat.<br/><br/>So, it's not the architecture of the game rules that's changing, but just the broader and broader scope of the story. <br/><br/>I very much like that the "heroes" might be moving on to schemes and adventures against some great evil but they secretly know that they remain <i>as fragile as ever</i>.<br/><br/><br/>(Aside: don't the basic AW rules make characters ridiculously powerful movers and shakers anyway? I'd be more worried about their starting capabilities! Removing some basic moves from some playbooks, etc, might help.<br/><br/>Another simple change, I think, would be: "Advance one basic move." Instead advancing three at once. It makes it an interesting option you can take again and again, and differentiates the characters. You could build in some different flavour, as well, like, "Now, when you seize by force, you can do it against a small army," or, "a 12+ on a "open your brain" roll allows you to save or doom one soul." Then the character who's advanced seize by force is completely different in flavour from the one who has advanced open your brain.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310053/#Comment_310053" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T09:13:42+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  9:13AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about doing a mash up of Apocalypse World and Blood and Honor in which you play members of the same village.

I know that lieutenants (or offspring or apprentices) could have a powerful role in the game, but I also know that most people would probably want to play out their initial characters to the bitter end (because who wants to see Aragorn or Theoden retiring and sending their men out to fight Pelennor Fields for them?), and I'm not sure how to structure that balance.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite>A smattering of thoughts.<br/><br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=27.0" rel="nofollow">Strata?</a></blockquote>\nYes. Strata would take care of A LOT of the problems I can see with extended campaigns. You, Sage and Paul are right: the beauty in the Lord of the Rings wasn't that the hobbits (or even most of the human characters) became world-crushing powerhouses, it's that they found the inner courage and were able through strengthened character and reputation to deal with problems they wouldn't have been able to at the beginning.<br/><br/>For that same reason, I also like your idea of starting only with the basic moves (or maybe one other, depending on your playbook).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>Dang..  the Midnight setting might be my favorite fantasy setting.<br/><br/>An Apocalypse World hack of that would be hot.</blockquote>\nTo be entirely frank, this whole hack started because I wanted an alternate version of Midnight that was story-game based, instead of d20. I am also really excited about the idea of Covenant Items in AW. (For those who don't know, Covenant Items were Midnight's workaround for the scarcity of magic items in the setting. Whereas in D&amp;D you get your +1 sword and then you go up a couple of levels and ditch it for a +3 sword, etc, in Midnight you got you one magic item and it improved as you did, so at Level 1 it had a minor power; at Level 3 it got another and so on. It's a really neat mechanic that actually makes you give a shit about your equipment by making it an integral and growing part of your character.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>Yup.

In the look section, there is a list of options that are vaguely about origin story. The Ghoul gets to pick from about six options, like: resurrected, constructed, rejected, sent, etc.<br/><br/>One other option you could have is that each playbook is a class (Wizard, Bezerker, Doomspeaker, Bone Rattler, Spirit Weaver, Titan, etc), and for each... in the look section, there's a list of races. So, the Wizard might have: Human, Elf, Gnome, Goblin (but not Dwarf or Orc, you'll note). That way, races are a part of the game, but aren't focal to the mechanics.<br/><br/>You could then make sure that Halflings sucked at Go Aggro, if that's your vision... just don't list Halfling as an option in the playbooks that have a solid Hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310107/#Comment_310107" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T15:35:07+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  3:35PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2011 3:38PM by John_Harper.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Data point from one of our long-running AW series (30+ sessions):<br/><br/>Powerful characters with lots of moves and great stats = still risky, still engaging, still apocalypse world.

Across almost two-dozen AW sessions as a player I can literally count on one hand the number of times I rolled even a *weak* hit when using my +3 stat.<br/><br/>Did anyone mention the prospect of elongating progression by having characters start at a net of +2 or 0 rather than AW's +4?  That would be another dial to tweak according to taste.  Depending on where you set other dials like "hit points," weapon damage and items, even a net 0 stat character wouldn't be ineffective when were acting in their wheelhouse.<br/><br/>One of my AW hacks (a total Shadowfist clone) that had Moves specific to Locations ("Feng Shui" sites,) was at least partly inspired by Midnight's "Places of Power."

I like the idea of racial moves but I was trying to think of other things that could be done with the idea of races. I'm leaning toward Joe's suggestion of each race having its own playbook. Doing that would mean ending up with the slightly nostalgic side effect of mirroring Red Box D&amp;D (Fighter! Cleric! Thief! Dwarf!), but it would also force racial variety into the build of the party. I'm envisioning a world where demihumans have been systematically hunted down and eradicated in the areas of the world that the Dark Lord has dominion over and, under those circumstances, it's unlikely that a demihuman-heavy party would be likely to emerge.

This was some sort of plot element that needed to be figured out before the power of that level could be unlocked, even if you already had the mechanical requirements. For example, one item's progression is "must learn the item\u2019s name", "must learn the name of the item's creator", "must learn the name of the troll Sky Raider for whom the item was created", "must learn what historic assault the item was crafted for", "must make a pilgrimage to the trollmoot towhich the item\u2019s creator and first owner belonged. At the trollmoot, the character must swear a Blood Oath with the trollmoot\u2019s leader". You can tune these to be more exciting, and plot driving. For a game where exploration is a factor, this sort of stuff can help players grab the reins of the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theg33k" title="theg33k"><img alt="theg33k" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/7043/fil31771.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theg33k">theg33k</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310120/#Comment_310120" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-29T00:09:09+00:00" title="January 29, 2011 12:09AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2011 12:09AM by theg33k.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Maybe characters at the end of their character arc must choose 1:<br/><br/>* Go out in a blaze of glory (e.g. Theoden).<br/>* Retire to safety (e.g. Frodo).<br/><br/>The player must then play a new character.</blockquote>\nIsn't it cute how I'm trying to figure out solutions for things that aren't broken?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite>As a tangential interruption,<i>Earthdawn</i>also used a similar idea, with an additional twist: some or all of the "levels" of the item<i>also</i>had a "narrative lock".

So interesting failure and half-successes with gripping hard choices become less and less common. That's ok, a little less direct fuckery on rolls, but it's not about power anyway.<br/><br/>But then if <i>everyone</i> is rolling +3 on <i>all</i> stats and have moves from all over, that's where I'd get bored, personally. The line between a Gunlugger and a Brainer gets thinner and thinner. I dunno, for some reason I just don't find it as appealing, maybe because the colour would get a little monochrome.

There's obviously a need for some structure here (as represented by the 'Empire' idea earlier), but I think there are ways to implement small amounts of it without going against what the game inherently tries to do. What I'm actually interested in exploring through this hack (which I've given the working title 'Overlord'), is using the climactic struggle of good and evil as the backdrop for an exploration of the characters' moralities and their own personal struggles against evil, both big and small. There is a HUGE amount of room to do that within the AW system and having the entire party trying to save the world while struggling with their individual Boromir-like urges sets the stage for some fantastic drama and roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310204/#Comment_310204" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-30T14:33:54+00:00" title="January 30, 2011  2:33PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing I'm thinking about: is an evil that's already won still really a Front?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theg33k" title="theg33k"><img alt="theg33k" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/7043/fil31771.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theg33k">theg33k</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310206/#Comment_310206" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-30T15:02:57+00:00" title="January 30, 2011  3:02PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>The thing I'm thinking about: is an evil that's already won still really a Front?</blockquote>\nThat's a totally valid point. The way I'm looking at it right now, the Overlord is almost done in his mission to conquer the world. I'm thinking somewhere between LoTR and complete domination. But even in Midnight, the Shadow hadn't completely won; there were still pockets of resistance, like the remaining Elves and the human underground. But he was close, and that's the world I want to explore--a world where hope's not dead, but it is fading and if the heroes don't succeed in their mission, the last remaining hope very well might slip out of the world.<br/><br/>So, yeah, he's still a Front, but his countdown clock is rolling right up on 12:00 and the heroes need to stop him ASAP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310208/#Comment_310208" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-30T15:21:12+00:00" title="January 30, 2011  3:21PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So long as it's a threat to the characters then yes. If it's not a threat to the characters it's context and setting and not a Front. Fronts are groups of related Threats. <br/><br/>Chris, have you played Vincent's other game, Dogs in the Vineyard? It makes a case that GM-defined good and evil isn't really that interesting in play. Moreover, your vision of "good and evil" might not be the players. I mean, there's a way to read Lord of the Rings as White Anglo-Saxon Men versus the Dark Skinned Others from the South and the East. In the setting, the industrialism of Sauron is set up against nostalgic pastoral feudalism. <br/><br/>AW instructs you to leap forward with named human characters. I think if one is too quick to cast them as irredeemably evil then they are not long compelling nor human, and interaction with them losses any ethical punch. <br/><br/>I'm not saying that you're committing to any of this, I'd just suggest it a thing to watch out for.<br/><br/>I was work on a dark fantasy hack myself over at Barf Forth, but I wasn't concerned with super long campaigns. I'd suggest starting with a limited list of basic moves and having to buy everything else for advancement via new 'prestige' playbooks or alternative advanced moves.<br/><br/>I think having a epic struggle or war going on as a back drop to the characters stories would be compelling. However, I don't think these sides need to be defined as good or evil. I think Blizzard has a good model for this with WoW: Neither the Horde or the Alliance are particularly 'evil,' both are self-interested and noble at various times. I think two or more 'Empires' struggling against each other, with the characters getting mixed up in it on levels big and small could meet your design goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310215/#Comment_310215" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-30T22:09:00+00:00" title="January 30, 2011 10:09PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: theg33k</cite>Yeah, I ran a one-off of Dungeon World before.

"Play to find out what the PCs make of this hostile, violent world, where all they have is one another and maybe not even that, and something is terribly wrong," is how you think of it as the designer.)<br/><br/>So, play to find out what? 3 possibilities off the top of my head, I'm sure there are more:<br/><br/><i>Play to find out whether the PCs can defeat the dark lord and destroy the one ring. </i>In this case, the open question - can they? Seriously, can they even do it? - is what drives your game design.<br/><br/><i>Play to find out what the quest will cost them, and whether they'll bear it. </i>In this case, design costs, and leave the choice of bearing them to the PCs. (This seems like the most self-grandiose and least fun option to me; a shallow reading of the source material.)<br/><br/><i>Play to find out the character's hidden strengths. </i>In this case, you have to design your game so that (a) the characters have strengths, that are (b) deep and hidden, yet (c) emerge seamlessly from the characters' selves, (d) in surprising ways.

It makes a case that GM-defined good and evil isn't really that interesting in play. Moreover, your vision of "good and evil" might not be the players. I mean, there's a way to read Lord of the Rings as White Anglo-Saxon Men versus the Dark Skinned Others from the South and the East. In the setting, the industrialism of Sauron is set up against nostalgic pastoral feudalism.<br/><br/>AW instructs you to leap forward with named human characters. I think if one is too quick to cast them as irredeemably evil then they are not long compelling nor human, and interaction with them losses any ethical punch.</blockquote>\nThe way I'm framing the game is that the Overlord is evil. Unquestioningly and irredeemably evil. The origin of the Overlord (to a certain extent) will be up to the PCs during the game set-up. He might be a dark god or he might be a man who has made the subjugation of the world his top priority, but either way, the evil of his (or hers or its) actions isn't up for dispute. When you get into the named NPCs, though, I want there to be a large amount of grey area, like the cast of the Song of Ice &amp; Fire books. Nobody in those books is black and white and they're all doing what they think they need to be doing in order to get by in a harsh and brutal world.<br/><br/>So, in that context, what I'm interested in exploring is the characters' experience with little evils and how they deal with them against a background of Cosmic Evil. Say the PCs are about to raid one of the Overlord's strongholds and they come across a battalion of his soldiers that are about to put a village to the sword. The PCs can't stop the executions from taking place without blowing their cover and jeopardizing the mission, but is it a risk that's worth it? For one PC it might be and for another it may not, but if they don't step in, will they slide closer to a Boromir-like state of moral ambiguity? Forcing the PCs to consider their decisions and consequences in a moral context is what's making this game interesting to me. That's what I'm shooting for.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I do think the idea of providing an Alliance/Horde sandbox for the PCs to play in is a really cool idea, but that's not what I'm after.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: philaros</cite>Okay. I hope I didn't come across too strongly snarky.</blockquote>\nNope. It's all good. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>If you could, eventually, whomp on that evil, definitely a Front.</blockquote>\nLet the whomping commence.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>So, play to find out what? 3 possibilities off the top of my head, I'm sure there are more:<br/><br/><i>Play to find out whether the PCs can defeat the dark lord and destroy the one ring.</i>In this case, the open question - can they?

Like Sam's loyalty, right? (This is my fave of the 3. A fun design challenge!)</blockquote>\nThis is great food for thought, Vincent. At first glance, this is how I see it:<br/><br/><i>You're playing to find out how the PCs will eventually manage to defeat the Overlord.</i><br/><br/>The Overlord is defeatable--that's ultimately the point of the game--so the fact that the PCs will eventually have the ability to take him down is kind of a gimme. But <i>how</i> they defeat him will depend on what it costs them and what strengths they can bring to their quest. They will be constantly fighting against doing what is easy in the pursuit of doing what is right and I'm planning on using a Corruption score to chart their relative morality. <i>That</i> will be what the quest costs them (and there <i>will</i> be consequences for having your Corruption get too high), but the way they handle it will be entirely in their hands. Similarly, I'm not sure the characters will have <i>hidden</i> strengths (though I'm not done playing with the mechanics yet), but it will be their strengths both as individuals and as a group that will see their quest victorious. (As an aside, now that I think about it, though, I do like the idea of having unlockable moves later in the game that allow characters to dispel Corruption in other characters at grave personal cost. That's a neat option.) Everything in Overlord will have a cost, but none of those costs will be up front, and everything will rely on the characters' strengths, but none of those strengths may be glamorous or immediately obvious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310512/#Comment_310512" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T19:42:33+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  7:42PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite><br/>Is gravity a Front?

Maybe I'm entirely wrong, so don't take this to heart. <br/><br/>I think there's a hidden, inherent disconnect between "defeating the dark lord is a gimme" and "how will you defeat him"? I can defeat the dark lord by gathering up an army of hobbit farmers and storming Barad Dur? Why? Because I'm the hero? Ok.<br/>In that light I would rephrase your answer ("You're playing to find out how the PCs will eventually manage to defeat the Overlord.") through the third of Vincent's options (I'm sure we can rule the first one out and the second is problematic right now).<br/><br/><i>"You're playing to find out how the PCs will eventually manage to defeat the Overlord through the characters' (hidden) strengths."</i><br/><br/>If defeating the Dark Lord is a given, why is that? Because the PCs are heroes. We're playing to find out how they find, develop and use their (hidden) powers to achieve that end, because we know they will. In that respect, Corruption should only be a colourful reminder of the ring's power, of the magnitude of the burden and of the heroism of our characters in overcoming it. I don't think your mechanics should let a character Corrupt themselves out of the game for example, for then the question doesn't become "how" but "will you?". You don't want to get to a moment in the game where the last standing PC fails his corruption roll and turns over to the dark side, and you as the MC then go "Uh...ha ha, ok, just kidding guys, you're not actually corrupted, Gandalf saves your ass, carry on." (Unless you want to make that into a <i>feature</i> of the game.)<br/><br/>Similarly with death: the PCs cannot die, because then the quest fails. When Aragorn falls over the cliff in the movie, he just goes missing for a while. Same with Frodo when he gets stabbed (on several occasions) - when the troll spears him, it's to showcase his mithril chainshirt, when the Witch King stabs him it's to showcase the cool skills of the other characters and his own heroism in pressing on. When Gandalf falls into the darkness, he is reborn with 300% more badass.<br/><br/>(again, I could be wrong)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theg33k" title="theg33k"><img alt="theg33k" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/7043/fil31771.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theg33k">theg33k</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310625/#Comment_310625" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T11:08:29+00:00" title="February  2, 2011 11:08AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>I think there's a hidden, inherent disconnect between "defeating the dark lord is a gimme" and "how will you defeat him"?</blockquote>\nThat's not what I said, though. What I said was that "that the PCs will <i>eventually have the ability</i> to take him down is kind of a gimme". Just because they will eventually have the ability to take them down doesn't mean that they will succeed. Yeah, they're the heroes, but that doesn't come with any implicit guarantees. Theoretically, 30th level PCs in D&amp;D will have the ability to take down Orcus, but that doesn't mean they'll <i>necessarily</i> win.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I could address all of your points individually (for instance, there are ways to reduce Corruption points in characters and the characters can quite definitely die), but I think the inherent problem here (and in many hack threads) is that I'm not telling you everything about the game and how the mechanics interlock. Right now everyone out there is operating under two reasonable assumptions: that it will be like Apocalypse World and that it will be like Lord of the Rings. That's fair--those are the examples I gave you--but the reality is that since I started working on the idea, the game has moved away from both of those things. At its heart it's still using the AW system, but it's VERY far away from a straight reskinning. Likewise, even though I stated that it was meant to emulate an epic fantasy campaign, the game will hopefully be malleable enough to encompass ANYTHING that falls remotely under that umbrella.<br/><br/>Really, I think I've hit a point where I'm moving ahead from the game's very rough initial concept, but it's not at a point where I'm ready for people to look at its individual gears and cogs, which puts it into a grey area where what the general population is sort of expecting from it and what I'm actually developing are at odds. In fact, it's exactly the kind of thing <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=380.0" rel="nofollow">Vincent addresses here</a>. So, while I think you have some valid points to make (and thank you for taking the time to make them), I don't think they're necessarily points that are relevant to what I'm doing.<br/><br/>I guess the bottom line is that I need to go into quiet mode for a little while and put together something worth showing to the public. Then I'll be ready to take comments and suggestions on it because everybody will be able to take a hard and critical look at what it actually is as opposed to what it might be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310628/#Comment_310628" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T11:21:53+00:00" title="February  2, 2011 11:21AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2011 11:22AM by Teataine.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: theg33k</cite>That's not what I said, though.

I think then you should perhaps be looking at Vincent's first option more closely then. Right now I think you could be going for any of them. This is of course assuming that those are the only three options (I do assume so at the moment, but I'm always ready to be proven wrong). But it seems you've already moved your design beyond the point that I think both Vincent and I attempted to address.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: theg33k</cite>Right now everyone out there is operating under two reasonable assumptions: that it will be like Apocalypse World and that it will be like Lord of the Rings.</blockquote>\nI was largely thinking under the LotR paradigm, yes.
