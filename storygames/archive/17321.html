Lately, each time I have<br/>run "Fiasco" at an event or for friends, I have presented a binder of several choices (about 5) all with Insta-setups (which I have tweaked <br/>on occasion).  I have twice in the last yr run "Booksellers of London", it's done well both times, and I will probably still make it one of the <br/>choices.  My goal is to keep the game no more than PG or PG13, even if we allude to more, I want the concepts and scenes to not cross <br/>that line.  I'm running the game at a really late hour but the store's niche in the community is for being family friendly, and personally<br/>at any public gaming I want to keep at PG13 or less.  <br/><br/>I don't like slasher movies, so I'm probably not going to include "Camp Death", but I plan  to include the "Hocus Focus" (Dresden), "Manna <br/>Hotel" with some slight alternations to the Insta-setup play-set, and I was looking for a couple more suggestions.  Once before I played <br/>"Manna Hotel" with some friends, before playing we tweaked the Insta-set up to incorporate elements of "The Lost Room" movie; it came <br/>out pretty well.  What I'm looking for is more a feeling of creepy ("Lost Room", "The Shining", and "Unknown Armies") and I will probably <br/>make Halloween the back drop date in both the Fiasco game and the "Zombie Cinema" game I'm running; as this Saturday IS the Halloween <br/>gaming event at the game store.  So if anyone has a play-set to recommend or some ideas to make the "Manna Hotel" Insta-set up more <br/>creepy, pls let me know.     <br/>Thanks,<br/>Shannon                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392619/#Comment_392619" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-07T09:04:11+00:00" title="October  7, 2012  9:04AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2012 9:04AM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Take a look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9dhri89xvpBX1lMcDdvelQ2Mkk/edit" rel="nofollow">In The Haunts Of Goblins</a><br/><br/>It's pretty halloweeny.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392620/#Comment_392620" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-07T09:19:14+00:00" title="October  7, 2012  9:19AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2012 9:19AM by Graham.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could try <i>Unaussprechlichen Klutzen</i>.

That way, you can include the exact elements you want (including age ratings) and the players still get the full Setup experience (one of my favorite parts of Fiasco). And who knows -- maybe your new playset will have some life outside of next week's game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392625/#Comment_392625" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-07T10:29:16+00:00" title="October  7, 2012 10:29AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            However, if you really just want to go with a pre-made playset, here is a gothic-horror one I made: <br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0Ut5mF-spZyZ1pnTXUxRFFxOTg/preview?pli=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0Ut5mF-spZyZ1pnTXUxRFFxOTg/preview?pli=1</a><br/><br/>I believe most of the elements are fairly family-friendly, but you may wish to give it a read through on that front, as I wasn't aiming for any specific age rating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/slliska" title="slliska"><img alt="slliska" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/631/nGS1XYKEZ7DB8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/slliska">slliska</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392626/#Comment_392626" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-07T10:47:18+00:00" title="October  7, 2012 10:47AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Levi, I very much like your play-set with the "Labyrinth" and "Legend", thanks for the suggestion and I will be including it my notebook  Graham thanks for your suggestion too but as I'm volunteering to run a couple of games, to help out a friend, I hadn't planned on purchasing anything.  jda1974, you are right, I should write my own Insta-setup play-set to be able to customize the element but I just never have the time.  I'm really an event organizer, not a GM, but a few times a yr I usually run things to help out friends that frequently help me the rest of the yr.  Not only is this gaming event this coming Saturday but I have another event before it I'm organizing for; so time is my enemy, as well I we'd want to use an Insta-setup as een RPGs  would possibly be new to the players, and I might only have a 3 hr slot.  jda1974, thank you for your Stonefalcon Manor suggestion, I think a spooky old house play-set is perfect for a selection.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392632/#Comment_392632" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-07T11:40:28+00:00" title="October  7, 2012 11:40AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.
