We were a group of ordinary people trapped in an old military facility on the side of a mountain while an unknown apocalypse occurred outside on January 1st, 2000.  Our menace was the facility's artificial intelligence, glitched by the Y2K bug.<br/><br/>In particular, I loved how the game ended.  We'd had one PC death up to this point, and all five of the remaining PCs were gathered inside the control room of the nuclear missile silo we'd discovered.  Every character except for one (the Soccer Mom) had two Conditions at this point.  The crazed Creepy Janitor decided that everything that had gone wrong was the fault of someone outside the complex interfering with their group and he tried to launch the missiles.<br/><br/>All the other PCs, naturally, sided against him, and it came to a conflict.  He had three dice.  Between the four of them, the others had around 12-15.  We rolled.  It came out as a tie, 11 to 11.  In Geiger Counter, both sides lose ties.  So, in one fell swoop, <i>every single character</i>, except for the soccer mom, died.  The missiles launched, and the computer congratulated the Soccer Mom (who it called General) on beginning Protocol 3.<br/><br/>Cut to black.  Roll credits.<br/><br/>I love this game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147278/#Comment_147278" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T09:51:10+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  9:51AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Pure awesome.</b>  The Seattle crew is definitely getting a huge shout-out in the GenCon ashcan.<br/><br/>Let me know if you folks are interested in playtesting some of the new "boxed scenarios" that I'm going to include with the game.  The first one is a one-shot medieval zombie adventure, "Black &amp; Gaunt," which features some variant rules where the menace gradually occupies more and more territory on the map.  The second one will be a three-part space trilogy inspired by the <i>Aliens</i> movies and <i>Pitch Black</i>, "Exit Strategy," which features three different maps, and the group decides which order to play them in.  One is a "long run" ala <i>Pitch Black</i>, where you have to keep moving forward to get to your escape craft.  Another is on a deep space mining vessel, trying to find a working escape pod amidst a mechanical labyrinth.  And the last I'm less sure about.  Maybe an underground prison, as in <i>Alien 3</i>, that's in the midst of collapsing?  Or a ship on a decaying orbit, about to crash into a heavily populated planet where the menace will escape and take over?

At first we thought about having a single evil critter, like a military project gone wrong. But once we stumbled on the AI idea, we all agreed on that. It worked out well.<br/><br/>I think that the Televangelist and the Handyman were the main characters. I did a few things with my Teenager, but I didn't have a good handle on her. She was more an action character, who took out a camera and blinded the AI when it tried to roll her over, later hung from a swiveling ceiling gun turret, and so on. I should have made up an 'issue' for my character, because she felt bland when compared to some of the other characters. Her mom (Single Mom) was there, too, and we died together in the nuke bay. Maybe they should have been at odds rather than a happy family.<br/><br/>We started in a cargo bay, had a biodome, a medical unit, tunnels, a command center, and an auxiliary command center (once we naded the first one). We all ended up in the nuke bay because one of our "trailer scenes" was a nuclear silo, and another was "character, clutching blood-spurting neck, lunges for button."

The schizo AI started misidentifying people; the Soccer Mom became "The General."  Someone else -- we never decided exactly who -- started calling Don the Televangelist's cell phone, flattering his patriotism, asking him to perform loyalty evaluations, and warning him to be on the lookout for subversives (and infecting him with Paranoia, in a nifty and beautiful rules interpretation/hack by Mr. Dowler.)<br/><br/>My favorite bits happened when Tony and Lukas took those bits I invented and started running with them.

So, in the GPNW game, this was one of the things that I tried to keep in mind, while also trying not to squash anyone's fun.<br/><br/>When characters would be framed into a scene, I would occasionally stop and say, "Okay, we last saw this character in location X doing Y with person Z.  How would they have gotten from X to A?"  I actually found that being deliberate about that in a few cases added to story a little bit (like when we figured out how the single mom was lured from the Bio-Dome to the Infirmary by the Vet telling her that her daughter was there), and it increased my buy-in for a lot of the scenes, because I didn't have to gloss over certain parts making no sense.

So much so that I had to start restricting it.  Otherwise, everyone would just take it from losing to the menace and it would never actually spread person-to-person.  I'm glad you folks hacked it in.<br/><br/>Yeah, there needs to be better advice in the text about how to do scene framing.  The steps I go through in my head look like this:<br/><br/>- which character has had the fewest scenes so far?<br/>- where were they last seen?<br/>- what were they doing last?<br/>- where are they likely to be now?<br/>- who's with them?<br/>- how do we crank this up a notch or reveal something interesting about the characters, the menace, or the locations?<br/>- that's the scene.<br/><br/>And then I break that up with scenes that don't feature the characters at all, or might feature one or two, but are about 15 seconds long and are usually purely narration from me, the scene Director, with maybe a witty comment from a character or another player stepping in to voice an NPC (there's generally a lot of interplay and "collective GMing" when I run Geiger anyway; I shift back and forth from being a strong, plot-orienting Director to being a free-wheeling, open-to-all-suggestions Director).  These micro scenes feature hints of the menace, or NPCs getting killed, or more problems emerging, or what NPCs far away from the action think of all this.  That helps with the pacing, I find.  It provides ideas for further scenes later and helps everyone recharge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
