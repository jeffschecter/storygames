Like, can't they take it like a man?<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise, I can't understand why the hell they are hitting the ball with a frickin' stick and running around in circles. The field looks kind of funny, too! Where are the goals?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it seems like it takes forever before the audience can finally start the slugfest. How do you know which side wins if all the audience does the whole time is watching some silly players chasing the ball? Why would anyone pay for that in the first place, if there's no slugfest?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I don't quite get it. Where was the fun, again?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190828/#Comment_190828" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-02T06:32:02+00:00" title="February  2, 2009  6:32AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wrong thread.
