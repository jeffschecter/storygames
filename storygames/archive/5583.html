I ran 2 one-shots and a mini-campaign of Exalted 1e. I was interested in playing or running it again, and went to Matt Gandy for advice on it (as he had just finished running a 1e/2e game for something like three years). He shuddered in horror. Every piece of advice I asked for was returned with a horror story on running the game: 2e being much better, rulewise, than 1e but just as onerous on its front-loaded requirements:<br/><br/>GM needs to know all the charms in order to present villains that aren't too powerful, or more commonly aren't too weak that they get punked by some PC combo they didn't take into consideration. This is the majority of pain.<br/>Therefore, writing up NPCs takes a small mountain of time.<br/>Finally, the inelegance of "i roll to hit" "i roll to defend" "i roll for damage" "i roll to soak" ... every single attack roll ... tends to set sail into "too fucking much" territory.<br/><br/>Setting, theme, flavor and all that: Love it.<br/><br/>In the end, I realized the following, lining up my own experiences with Exalted, and games like D&amp;D:<br/><br/>* Combat in Exalted is boring, for me.<br/>* I like the idea of knowing and manipulating the raw data behind the charms: "Gaming the system". Doing the MtG thing in an RPG, stacking effects or manipulating charm combos for maximum effect in a situation.<br/>** Problem is that there's too goddamn many charms for me to be able to do this without exploding. I could have done it if there were, like, 4-5 charms per skill, not but not 10+ for some 25-30 skills.<br/>* The knowing and manipulating of the data behind the charms is a mini-game in itself. And again, under other circumstances, a fun one.<br/><br/>Then, I started thinking about D&amp;D, and how it basically does a similar mini-game thing, but the knowledge is of a limited number of combat manuvers on a square tile map. There's the "Great Cleaves" and the "AoOs" and the "Flanking Bonuses": They're there to be manipulated and gamed. And unlike the Charms from Exalted, there's not 250+ of them (per fatsplat!), there's maybe, MAYBE 40 total. And only about 10 that are universal, that you would use often at a given level. <br/><br/>Anyway, coming to that realization, both that I like manipulative mini-games, and that some games' mini-games are much more vast than others, got me into digging D&amp;D again.<br/><br/>Currently, I'm in a D&amp;D 3.5e game (using the E6 hack). I've got an Ice Elf Spirit Shaman 1/Rogue 3. Out of Combat, I'm Roleplay Central (in fact I think I took too many "story liberties" in the last adventure, basically creating my own side-plot). In Combat, I'm Mistaa Kombatto (Mister Combat), throwing down flank/hidden attacks, pointing out when I or others on my team can use Attacks of Opportunity, Zones or Scenery to their advantage, etc. I'm loving it.<br/><br/>So, uh, this was just a little story. The morals might look something like:<br/>Viva D&amp;D!<br/>Viva Exalted, with its cool background and setting!<br/>Hopefully someone will come around to make an Exalted-ish game, but with Less Stuff to keep in "active memory"!<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125102/#Comment_125102" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T06:15:43+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  6:15AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, I just finished an eight month stint of DMing DnD and I got so burnt out on it.

I've never played Exalted, but DnD, with all the feats, maneuvers and especially spells is a lot to keep track of. Maybe compared to Exalted it looks great, but preparing my DnD game every week became a pain in the ass, and one I dreaded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125105/#Comment_125105" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T06:34:22+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  6:34AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Bent, what level did you get to?

That's probably a big nearsighted error on my part: I was specifically thinking solely of feats, combat manuvers and class abilites.<br/><br/>With E6 (the hack where you play levels 1-6, and then freeze at 6 forever, only gaining feats and nothing more), here's the thing: <b>You never have to crack the spell books past 3rd level.</b> So the chances are very good that you only have to pay minimal attention to spells in the balance (just read the PC casters' sheets).  I'm guessing that as the PCs advanced to higher and higher levels, that created a geometric amount of things to pay attention to?<br/><br/>That might be the big difference.<br/><br/>The thing is, I'm not sure you can do the same in Exalted: You can say "no growth!" and lock down all characters at chargen, ensuring that everyone from PCs to NPC baddies have only 10 charms. But that's still choosing from hundreds of charms that have wildly different effects.  Probably the only way you can "e6-ify" Exalted is to say "rewrite the charm list so that anything requiring more than 3 essence is removed from the game", but somehow that feels kinda ill. Not comperable to E6, in some way.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125108/#Comment_125108" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T06:53:56+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  6:53AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damnit, Andy, keep pimping my hack and I'll be in danger of violating the terms of my sabbatical!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125111/#Comment_125111" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T07:18:50+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  7:18AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, E6 can get bloated too if you allow too many feats, but you CAN still allow them if you make gateway feats.

With the uncommon exceptions, I simply use standard NPCs (10th lvl kobold ranger, 7th lvl orc barbarian, 11th lvl human wizard...), and make them cool by role playing.<br/><br/>And the thing about maneuvers in DnD is that most of them work under very similar circumstances (in some cases pretty much the same ones).

Then again, the higher levels of DnD seem to be a lot of make-the-saving-throw-or-die type encounters, so maybe it'd almost be easier?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125162/#Comment_125162" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T10:36:37+00:00" title="February  8, 2008 10:36AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really, really enjoy levels 1-6 D&amp;D.

When my "big bad" got creamed in three rounds, and my "light diversion" would have killed a PC in the first hit if I didn't fudge my dice, I was forced to come to the realization that finding a balance is fucking hard in Exalted. Although, I should have known this, since it's a Storyteller game, my previous "big bad" who I planned to have as the supervillain to oppose the werewolf PCs got killed in round 1.<br/><br/>Still, D&amp;D has too much, but I'm really drawn to reduced systems like Iron Heroes (which is only slightly reduced, unless you count spells) and True20.<br/><br/>However, I'm having a blast with my HeroQuest Exalted.
