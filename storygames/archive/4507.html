They can always be used in any description, and they give bonuses if they're the right domain <i>and</i> have been activated. Offensive traits for offensive maneuvers and denying resources, defensive traits for defensive maneuvers and resisting resource denials or recovering a resource. All of the active ones of the same type (all activated PO's, frex) <i>stack</i>.<br/><br/><b>Resources</b> are used in <b>Strikes</b>. They can always be used in any description, and the <i>highest</i> offensive one of a particular type adds to your damage rolls while the highest defensive one subtracts from damage rolls against you. So your highest PO resource adds to your damage roll in physical conflicts, and your highest PD resource subtracts from an opponent's damage roll against you in physical conflicts. If your highest resource of a particular type is denied, the next highest one (if you've got another one) applies. They do not stack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111187/#Comment_111187" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T19:06:24+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  7:06PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was really fun.  I had read the rules but the way they worked at the table weren't clear to me.  In play, its a really neat push and pull of getting advantage points for saying cool shit and turning down those points in order to go to the dice.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to re-reading the rules now that I've played so I can have a solid grip on them for when Bret's PC goes on a Beast Hunt.<br/><br/>Fiction-wise, my Beast Hunter was climbing a cliff after the little lizard-cat thing that is the suggested first adventure.  It was scurrying in and out of little burrows along the cliffs, scaring the goats.  My first challenge was a physical challenge for making my way through this crevice that had flesh-eating scarabs along the walls.  When I got through to a cave, the Lord of Devil Mountain's Masked Guard had my critter in a net, because the Lord wanted it as a pet.  It was a long social conflict discussion before they gave it up.<br/><br/>Then me and the critter had a tussle in and out of the pool at the foot of the cave's waterfall and when it tried to get out of the cave I sat on the bastard and killed it as humanely as I could.  Its tattoo shows it scarring a tiny scar it gave me on my arm in order to remind her that even the smallest of things can be a threat.<br/><br/>Fun stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111250/#Comment_111250" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T05:41:38+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  5:41AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2007 5:43AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man. I am desperate for Judd to go for a higher-limit hunt next time so that I have more to throw at him. The 5/20 conflicts were sad! But I think that's a cool aspect of the game - he sets his own challenges.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to the next session where I get a chance to hunt. We've talked about having a sort of mirror-session where we cut to my character and he's hunting the same critter.<br/><br/>I'm interested in how hunts tie into story goals, and how you can pursue an adventure without a hunt. It seems, well, undesirable. That tattoo is a powerful lure. But from the book it seems as though you can pursue a hunt without a critter at the end if you want to achieve something in the narrative. Is this right?<br/><br/>I also want to design my own Beasts. Desperately. Are there guidelines for setting Beast stats to the Limit/Pool of a hunt?

In Ron's game, for example, they found them to be pretty tough. If you want to speed the game up a bit and make it a bit tougher, I'd suggest the Low Strike Cost hack, where you change the cost for Strikes to 4AP per D6. I used that last time I ran it, and I actually enjoyed it immensely (especially for short time slots); in fact, I'm thinking about making that the standard.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>Are there guidelines for setting Beast stats to the Limit/Pool of a hunt?</blockquote>\nJudd <a href="http://www.berengad.com/vanilla/comments.php?DiscussionID=22" rel="nofollow">asked about that on our forums</a>.

Yes, instead of "fight this beast and gain the tattoo," your adventure could be "kill off the blackskull tribe" or "retrieve your tribe's spiritual totem from the ruins of Ysvey." Or whatever. You might hit a point when the beasts are just too powerful for you to go straight from one to the next; doing a different adventure is one way to gain reward points and beef up in the meantime. Also, if you're just plain more interested in following a story element that's come up in your game, you can do that. Oh, and because there are few multiplayer beasts out there (two as of now), it's a way to have a "regular" adventure with more than two players.<br/><br/>Also: I assume you guys haven't used Secondary Goals yet. Let me know when/if you do and how it goes; it tends to add a new layer to the experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111852/#Comment_111852" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T05:41:54+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  5:41AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played last night, and this time Chuqua pursued the Hektratan through the caves and past the blind creepers. We ended up describing the blind creepers as underground albinos with the bodies of gorillas (though personally I think of them as more wiry, not as much mass) with the heads of lampreys and hoods connecting their heads to their shoulders. They echolocate making "whooping" sounds that ALL the Underfolk know the second they hear it.<br/><br/>We did use Secondary goals last night as a little boy followed after me to try and avenge his little sister against the Hektratan and I had to rescue him from the blind creepers. It added a cool element of tension as I worried that Judd might get there first.<br/><br/>And Judd showed me that 5-limit challenge can kick my ass. Chuqua passed through the Tombs of the Underfolk and they tried to convince him to lay down with them and sleep. It was a social challenge, and their whispers were a +6 Offensive Social trait. I was one wound away from losing when I managed to convince them to let me pass to continue my hunt, promising that I'd join them one day with stories of hunts and glory to share with them.<br/><br/>We totally need to write up a Blind Creeper as a Beast so I can hunt it and tattoo it. Though I don't know what power its tattoo should give.<br/><br/>Oh, and after the game last night we were kibitzing and we figured out why you'd want to do an adventure without a hunt, yeah. For the exp! Next session Judd's doing a 10/30 adventure to gain the respect of the Devil Lord. I'm torn right now between hunting the pack-hunting rodent beasts, or doing something horrible to the Blood Stones - the rival tribe of the Cavewalkers (Chuqua's tribe) who interfered with his hunt for the Hektratan.<br/><br/>After the adventure, I definitely felt the need to beef up and increased "My mother showed me the soft places to strike a beast" and "The tongue of the Underfolk" to make me fightier and not as squishy in a social conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111871/#Comment_111871" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T06:52:24+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  6:52AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wanted to say how awesome these write-ups have been.

Glad you are digging it.  I'm going to number your questions to make this easy.<br/><br/>1) Bret and i went through our 5/20 adventures in a few hours.<br/><br/>2) The rules are pretty intuitive but it helped a whole lot to have the downloads from the site that walk you through the process.  I think Brand made those cheat sheets if memory serves.  Thanks, Brand!<br/><br/>3) I really like how Bret and I have takek what we like from the setting and let the rest get made through our traits.  The way his adventures occur under the mountain and mine occur over is entirely nifty and I'm sure there will be neat cross-overs.<br/><br/>I'd start with a nice, low-key Hektratan hunt and just get a grip on how things go.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111897/#Comment_111897" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T08:18:27+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  8:18AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, I like the Silent Creepers.

The salute, like several parts of the game really, is like a formalization of something that I've done in my gaming that just works really well--having a set start and end point, and explicit expectations tied to it. So I know several people who think, "we don't need this," and they may be perfectly right! If they've got their own thing in its place already. And we've had plenty of threads about rituals where it seems like many people do. But many other people don't, or like to have something specific that fits with the game, so that's why it's in there as an actual rule.<br/><br/>(And I really like the Silent Creepers, too! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112285/#Comment_112285" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T07:50:15+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  7:50AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also:<br/><br/>Giving advantage points before going to the dice is not only a way to show that something rocks but is also a pacing mechanism.<br/><br/>There has been once or twice per session that either of us as the Challenger gave the other 8 or more Advantage Points because the other's  way of dealing with a conflict was just so freaking awesome.

Sometimes a challenge doesn't turn out to be as juicy or filled with opportunities as you thought, and then it's best to move on and keep the fun going rather than plow through <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Also, be sure to move your baseline of AP offers with activated traits.

I'd be eager to try it myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236315/#Comment_236315" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T08:26:52+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  8:26AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2009 8:27AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really liked this game too.<br/><br/>I think it's too easy for a game to die when you say, "We'll play this whenever we feel like it," because finding two points when schedules line up AND you both feel like it and wouldn't rather just sit around and scratch your butt is near impossible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
