Some unrelated craziness had Lydia looking to start a new MUSH and I'd signed on. Fred has pretty much left it all behind him, but he's unable to resist a good mechanics discussion.<br><br>So, we initially decided that there's nothing we'd like better than a pared-down Polaris negotiation system for conflict resolution.  In my heart, I *still* think it would be best, but we hit upon a very practical roadblock, and that is that MUSHers fear change. They fear it like giant electronic bunnies.<br/><br/>As such, this has been a fascinating experiment in keeping things looking familiar enough that people don't run away screaming, while inserting soem more contemporary ideas of RPG design.  To this end, we have *absolutely* ripped off a number of Story Games.  Elements that some folks may recognize include:<br/><br/>* Conflict resolution involves explicit discussion of consequences, with an implicit discussion of stakes.  <br/>* Props are designed to have charters, which are written up in the style of <i>Mortal Coil</i>.  This is cooler in theory than in practice, as MUSHers are also lazy.<br/>* War is a result of Lydia playing <i>Ganakagok</i> at Dexcon and going "neat" and stealing a lot of the medicine pushing.  Blame Don.<br/>* The game has no secrets, though it has hidden information.  That information is codified into Lore Sheets (abbreviated from <i>Weapons of the Gods</i>) and while it's not possible to get _all_ of them, all of them _can_ be gotten.  Player investment in these also gives us a direct measure of player investment in the props they're tied to.<br/>* "Storybuilding" is a polite way to say "Ripping off <i>Polaris</i>".<br/>* Strong metagame currency in the form of "focus"<br/>* Stats are not what you *can* do (Strength, Warfare, etc.) but rather how you do it (Grace, Wits, Force, Resolve)<br/>* Talents are presented as things like "swordsman and strong", but the reality is that they equally easily support "Revenge" or "In the name of my Father"<br/>* Power pricing totally ripped off from <i>Everway</i><br/>* We have an <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/roadtoamber/785.html" rel="nofollow">expectation of awesome</a><br/><br/>And to top it all off, we're actually doing playtesting before we go live.  <br/><br/>Honestly, this may all explode horribly, but it's proving an interesting challenge in the meantime.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - And so props are given where they are due - Lydia is our editor, and through a strangely MUSH related turn of event is also the original hat of evil from which we take our name.  She is also our resident super genius, and one of the players in the very first Fate game.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Amberyl" title="Amberyl"><img alt="Amberyl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Amberyl">Amberyl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85823/#Comment_85823" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T11:33:29+00:00" title="August  6, 2007 11:33AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://roadtoamber.com/" rel="nofollow">The Road to Amber</a> MUSH's staff is specifically me, Rob, Morgan (another friend of ours), and Fred, in fact.<br/><br/>We got back into MUSHing after a couple of years of hiatus, and it is sucking us back in like the great sucking thing that it is.<br/><br/>You are all, of course, welcome to drop by and create characters...<br/><br/>-Lydia                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blake%20T.%20Deakin" title="Blake T.

They fear it like giant electronic bunnies.</blockquote>\nThis is interesting, because I think the Polaris system is about as close as I've ever seen to how actual roleplay proceeds on a MUSH. Like, just in terms of the natural flow of poses and when 'conflict' arises and how that conflict tends to be addressed. It's about as un-changed as you can get, and yet most MUSHers wouldn't recognize that -- because what they think of as the formalised system is something external to the basic flow of roleplay that takes up 95% of all MUSH gaming.<br/><br/>I kind of wish I liked Amber more, as a gaming world.

Some of these games aren't active any longer, but there are other games that aren't on the list; I think there are somewhere around 200 active games. <br/><br/>How active is active, however, is the important question, and I don't think anyone has ever tried to get an accurate count of how many people play mushes right now. If I had to guess I'd say 75% of those games average fewer than 10 people online at once, with the rest somewhere between 10-50 online; of course some people play many different games. The largest games have several hundred online, but aren't exactly considered 'family-friendly'. <br/><br/>So on any given night, my totally unscientific estimate is about  2500 people are mushing. <br/><br/>The overall text mud community however, is much larger -- people usually throw out the 50,000 to 100,000 range -- and a small portion of those muds are also considered 'RP' muds, but I would be surprised to see story game influences in something that wasn't a mush.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

I do miss MUSHing to some extent. It has some great potential as a gaming medium, but man, the MUSHers themselves burned me out, which is what I think happened to a lot of us. I don't know if it's because it was just WoD games or what, but the bitterness and craziness was nasty.<br/><br/>So my question for Mr. Donoghue would be: Given that, as you say, MUSHers fear change and you want to try something new, would it be feasible/desirable to try and recruit new players to MUSHing rather than bend to the will of the people running around in their ruts?

I played in a Changeling one that was pure awesome - everyone was a Changeling (although there might have been a couple of people playing mortals).  I helped run that was general World of Darkness with a mix of many types, mortal, Vampire, shape shifters, and a few other odd things, which depended on what you wanted to play.<br/><br/>I've tried to explore it again since college and, man, without the ample free time I had during college, I just can't dive in anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86360/#Comment_86360" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T19:38:43+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  7:38PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it's possible, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

The interesting thing though is that there are still players who hang on and are willing (more like dying) to try something new and possibly non-crazy; just read some of the threads at forums like WORA for examples.
