The example that came to mind was bullfighting and how it could be modeled in a game setting.<br/><br/>The thing about bullfighting is that it has only two outcomes: the matador gets the bull or the bull gets the matador.  This could be resolved with a single roll but that takes away from the drama of the fight itself.  As any fan of bullfighting can tell you, the fight is far more important than how it ends.<br/><br/>The opposite extreme would seem to be a roll for everything.  When the matador flashes his <i>muleta</i> and allows the bull to pass, closer and closer, there are rolls.  When the <i>banderillas</i> are placed (by the matador or the banderilleros) there are rolls.  When it comes time for the killing blow, there are rolls.  But that seems terribly mechanical.  Is there a middle way?<br/><br/>I know that <i>The Burning Wheel</i> breaks fighting and duels of wits into little pieces resolved separately but have not read deeply enough into the rules to know how that is done.  Is this the sort of middle way I'm talking about, or is it roll, roll, roll?  And more importantly, can this sort of mechanic be applied to a broad spectrum of activities (like a bullfight) or must such a thing be constructed for every sort of contest.  Meaning: would one have to create a whole new system just to portray that bullfight?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245487/#Comment_245487" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T08:07:38+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  8:07AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you played Contenders, Sam?

Well, not Fight! and Duel of Wits anyway. You might be interested in BW's linked tests, which are a series of rolls for tasks that are supportive of another task where failure on a linked test makes the final roll more difficult and success makes it easier, but that doesn't right for your example, since it puts the dramatic weight on the final roll (although tension can ebb and flow during the intermediate steps).<br/><br/>Another option that comes to mind actually comes from Paranoia (XP I think), where players take turns spending points to modify a roll and narrating the situations that create those modifiers, then rolling to resolve the situation.<br/><br/>That sounds like more of a "middle ground" to me, but still not suitable to the bullfight example maybe.

It seems like a disservice to reduce it all to a single roll, but "roll for effective use of the <i>muleta</i>," "now roll to execute an elegant pass," "now roll to excite the audience for the next charge of the bull," isn't a whole lot better.<br><br>It's at times like these that I wish I had a better grasp of the principles involved in making a game.  It seems so simple to say, "A game should be able to encompass the inherent complexity of the bullfight without turning into a battery of dice rolls," but the execution is much, much harder.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247383/#Comment_247383" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T13:35:18+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  1:35PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2009 1:37PM by Valamir.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, this is assuming that being a matador is a central feature of the game...thats its worth measuring these nuances to begin with.  For a heist game you might use a similar degree of effort for safe cracking, for a medical drama for performing surgury...or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you could easily do this with Otherkind-esque dice, where the things you can do to "score points" (or however earning kudos for your performance is done in bull fighting) are the "good things that can happen" options and the things that could go wrong (besides simply not doing the above right) are the "bad things that can happen" options (like getting gored, or stumbling, or whatever other kind of faux pas are common enough to want to model).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you're rolling your pool of dice and allocating them to each category.  5-6s in "good things" means "wow that was amazing", 1-2s mean "boooorrrrriiiingggg....what is this amateur night?"   5-6s in "bad things" means "thank god that didn't happen", 1-2s mean "whoops".<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the categories might be arranged in groups of related skills.  Like these 2 good things and 1 bad thing are related to cape handling, and associated with the color Red.  Those 2 good things and 2 bad things are related to footwork and associated with the color Green...(and so on with all the other skills that are important to bull fighting that I know nothing about).  Some of the categories might be related to more than one thing.  Then if your matador is particularly skilled in a given area he gets extra dice...of that color...and those dice can only be used for those categories.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, since Bull Fighting (based on the little I know of it) involves a ritual like procedure that tends to unfold in a particular order (first you do this with the bull, then you do that with the bull...or whatever) you can arrange these categories in the relevant order to resolve them.  They might then have effects that carry forward.  For instance if excelling in "this thing" means you have an advantage later when you do "that thing" then the result of putting a 5 or 6 in "this thing" might be to give you the option to reroll the die you assigned to "that thing" when you get there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a bunch of ways you could do it depending on what you want to feature and how involved you want it to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance instead of the above you could use Don't Rest Your Head style dice where you're rolling a pool of dice and counting up successes (like evens) but there are several different colors of dice in the pool and which ever one rolls highest is the "dominant" effect of the pool.  So if the green dice are related to the "muleta" and your highest die rolled is green, then you know that this fight featured a particularly effective use of the muleta.  Or you can get more nuanced and say if the high die was even it means a particularly memorable good thing, whereas if it was odd and the overall roll didn't get many successes than it means a particularly memorable bad thing (like dropping the muleta or something).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you have the option of freely choosing to roll more dice in an attempt to get more successes.  In DRYH I believe these are Madness dice, but for this they could be "Reckless" dice.  Yay for rolling more dice, but if a Reckless die dominates (more likely the more of them you roll) then Bad Things happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of those are "reduced to a single roll" but since there is nuance to the way that roll is read you get an entire story out the results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247385/#Comment_247385" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T13:40:43+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  1:40PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel might not be a middle way, but it would make for an awesome bullfight IMHO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248518/#Comment_248518" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-25T06:14:55+00:00" title="December 25, 2009  6:14AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 25, 2009 7:27AM by Sam!.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Burning Wheel might not be a middle way, but it would make for an awesome bullfight IMHO.</blockquote>\nJames, do you think the basic method of resolving detailed combat would work, or would it require a new set of specific rules?

In fact, almost any similar problem I've ever had with game design could be solved with "Otherkind Dice" as they are generally known thanks to that post by Vincent. That is not to say they are perfect. Far from it. There's not enough room to fiddle with them, they're hard to relate to static skill and attributes, etc. etc. But basically, anything you would ever want to do in a RPG you can do by picking up three d6 and rolling them Otherkind-style.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
