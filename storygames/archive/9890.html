My memory tells me that in 3:16 you write down 2 skills, a couple of weapons, and a one line description about your character. Despite that, the games that I have played have had characters with much richer, more full, albeit stereotyped, personalities than in most games that I've played that required writing down a lot about the characters (4e, Fate). <br/><br/>Factors that I've speculated on include<br/>1. A sense of RPGs as competition. We say that role-playing isn't about competition, but there are a lot of rules designed to make characters "fair" or "not-overpowered," which only matters if there is some sort of competition. Now, much of that competition is for spotlight time and comes with a fear that Superman will end up in the spotlight more often than Alfred. A problem better solved by interesting stories than "balance" as far as I'm concerned.<br/>2. Points of contact between the character descriptions and the rules. The more a characters description requires reference to the rules, the more we feel like we need to write down to make sure that we are getting in right. <br/>3. Departure of the game world from the real world. The more elements that are different from the real world, whether physics, geography, organizations, etc. the more we need to write down to keep things straight.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219780/#Comment_219780" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T08:07:42+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  8:07AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Statting can be fun in and of itself.

This is the big one for me. With only a couple of strings to your bow, strategy can become very lacking. Sure you can describe strategies verbally and try earn bonuses and so forth, but then you're largely placing your strategy on 'saying something the GM agrees with'. I like a game's mechanics to present an internal strategy that makes sense and benefits those who think ahead. Not necessarily 'munchkinism', but presenting different options that are useful in different situations so that the GM can challenge the players by altering the playing field rather than just upping the ante. It all depends on whether you like a game to be roll some dice, then have fun describing it, or describe what you do, then have fun rolling those dice.<br/><br/>2) Memory. I for one often forget what a character is like after a long hiatus, which isn't uncommon since I often find I can't get a game in anywhere. Statistics can be more than just bonuses to rolls, they can also be inspiration for what your character's personality is like.<br/><br/>3) Longevity. With only a few options to enhance, there's only so far you can develop a character. If you're into the whole 'advancement' aspect of RPGs (which I freely admit not everyone is - I don't like it much myself) then after a while a limited character will begin to stagnate.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219789/#Comment_219789" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T09:03:04+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  9:03AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am completely missing the point between the first part of your post and the second part, Aaron.

I instruct the player to use 10 words or less to describe their character's physique and personality, and I added a little Jungian personality type section so that NPCs and "Voices" (or anyone really) could have key components of their personalities described with just four letters.

So stats, skills, special abilities, the type of armor he's wearing, the type of weapon he's using... All of this falls under your broad term of 'description'?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case.. I'm gonna go a little Malcolm Reynolds and say... Because.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just sorta.. works out like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I'll take a step back, examine that a bit, and give a better answer. More effort put into the character means a literal investment (of time and effort) which makes the character more important, more real. A quickly described character can be thrown away early, and it causes little consternation. This can be good, if it supports the goals of play, such as in 3:16, where character death is just a thing that happens sometimes, and it isn't something the player should get bent out of shape about. But when you put a lot of effort into 'describing' your character, it's a declaration that you intend to keep this one for a while. You've got time to settle into it, get comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes that quick character can just CLICK with you, and you'll have amazing play. Sometimes that heavily described character becomes an albatross around your neck before you've even stepped into character. In my experience though, the more effort put into the character, the richer it will be. My sheer delight at playing DitV would probably have been largely alloyed if I hadn't latched on to a concept and written up a backstory before even sitting down at the table. Dove was awesome, and I don't just mean his abilities in the talking and shooting arenas. Those traits, that backstory, worked themselves beautifully into the traits I put on the table and played in the game. I still remember the coat, made from leather strips rather than cloth by his faithful mother, with a stitch put into it by each of the members of the unfaithful community in which he'd grown up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219841/#Comment_219841" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T12:06:21+00:00" title="July 21, 2009 12:06PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Homeworld Project, character description is something that starts as a specifically limited thing. You have a certain upper limit of short phrases you can fill in (or you can save them till later to get a little descriptive vignette during the action), but as the game goes on an you gain layers of grains you gain more room for these descriptors, in addition to more resources.<br><br>Eventually though the grain reaches a maximum point and locks down, and you lose all the resources as the descriptors become fixed in the setting. So your "power" waxes and wanes, but the reward of description is what persists. <br><br>Homeworld Project rewards the GM(s) in the same way. <br><br>I've seen this in other game (mine and otherwise), that building the character and the setting is a powerful thing, but it requires it's own pacing. I don't believe it would work as well if it was overly front loaded with lots of character description to start with or if the description during play wasn't ritualized in the same way. <br><br>It is important to remember that the dynamic act of describing is fun, while the passive description after the fact is only a shadow. <br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lantern314" title="lantern314"><img alt="lantern314" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lantern314">lantern314</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219843/#Comment_219843" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T12:09:29+00:00" title="July 21, 2009 12:09PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK Wolfe, I'll grant you DiTV.

The description is there to help the players form a mental picture of what this character is like and what they might want to do in the game. Since my games are almost always one shot affairs people don't have to remember what happened from play session to play session. They can start fresh each time. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo in Dead Man on Campus (which I am proud to say I've not got out in two stores - St Louis and Atlanta) the Zombie Louis Bentley has a write up that goes something like this "The last thing I remember I was over in France. We went over the top and all went black. Now it's 1923 and I'm back. I don't know how I got here. I don't know why I do the things I do.

Descriptions like this lead to games that are not about number crunching but more about player interaction. So if your game is meant to do that then a written description might be a good way to go. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever stats are in a character should contribute to the game otherwise they are just fluff.

The character has an interesting backstory, you said? Does that backstory read like an adventure, or does it set the character up to HAVE an adventure?<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from that issue, I'm not claiming that backstory is important, really. I'm saying that rich description can help you get a better feel for the character, and make them feel more lived in. I used to do FFRP on AOL, and I had a bad case of what we called alt-itis. I would create a new screen name, fill out a description for the character, smush together a basic concept and play. The more descriptive I was, the more proactive in expressing the character, the more I allowed the character to grow in that initial play, the greater the chance I would continue to play that character. This is different, as it's description as a part of play rather than aside from the direct act of playing, but it's still an emphasis on discovering who the character is by telling others who they are (in text; this might be important). Once you know yourself, you can stop telling, and start <i>showing.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI've played as a player in 3:16 twice, and while I really enjoyed the fiction and the interactions, I didn't feel comfortable in my own skin. The character didn't feel alive to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219907/#Comment_219907" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T14:30:29+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  2:30PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 2:33PM by lachek.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I made a CoC character a few years ago, who I got really into, wrote a fantastic backstory based on a lot of research about actual 20s New England, spent a ton of time on the character sheet, practiced accents, and so on.<br><br>Then I was thrust into a pre-made scenario and found my character to be the flattest thing I'd ever played. He didn't mesh well with the plot, his motivations were all wrong, his backstory was irrelevant and encumbered rather than informed every time I wanted to make a decision, his actual in-game actions didn't pan out at all the way I pictured in the backstory, etc. And looming over all that was the dread of losing all my work to a botched Shotgun roll. It was one of my worst game experiences, largely due to my own making.<br><br>By contrast, the method I use for my game-in-development is this:<br><br/>Come up with a name, pick a concept from a list, distribute points to three stats (Resourceful, Helpful, Leader), assign five superficial Traits (like Angry, Holy or Baseball Bat) that fits well with your concept.<br/>Play out an introductory flashback scene to let us know about your character and anchor them in the scenario.<br/>Play the game, which is super-lethal - you'll probably die horribly. You also get to advance your stats pretty rapidly in-game.<br/>If you survive (in most games, only one character will survive a given scenario), you gain another Trait (called a Scar) and get to keep the stats that advanced during the game.<br/>When you start the new scenario, everyone but the survivor(s) make new characters according to the principle above. There is no "balance".<br/><br/>My hope is that you can make a quick throw-away character (due to the high lethality, an involved chargen is not an option), who gradually becomes precious to you as she's fleshed out and advanced in-game. The players come to know and love this character as she survives, and mourns her eventual death more than they would a recent arrival. The balance thing might be a problem in a different game - in this one, it's intended as a feature, as the game is pseudo-cooperative in that usually only one character survives a scenario, and you want to be it. So, the intent is that if you want to "win" a scenario, you have to team up to take out the grizzled survivor, I suppose much like you'd team up to vote off the strongest player in a reality TV show to even the odds.<br/><br/>Not sure it works yet, but it sounds by this thread as though the principles are sound.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_219915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219915/#Comment_219915" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T14:43:04+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  2:43PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 11:49PM by TomasHVM.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lantern314</cite>Why do so many games require that you write down a lot of details about your character?</blockquote>Tradition. Not a very functional one, in my view.<br/><br/>1. problem is that most players are bad writers. They write stereotypical backgrounds (orphan, though).<br/><br/>2. problem is that most players are bad actors. They have difficulties acting out a premade detailed personality, even if it is given by themselves. A character evolving from their imagination and limited acting skills while playing, have a greater chance of being a functional character with depth.<br/><br/>3. problem is that the game stiffens with all this background info, so opportunities for creating background on the fly, in situations where it really counts and will enrichen the game, is lost.<br/><br/>Simple solution: create the core of your characters in pre-gen, and evolve the personality of it in game, on the basis on a few elements. They start out as stereotypes, but evolve into a living persona outside ourselves, and inside us. And they stay flexible in the initial stages of the game, giving us the opportunity to weave in background-info piecemeal while the plot evolves around them. By being open to creating family members and relationships during the game, we get to make tense and meaningful interaction out of the most valuable NPC-material; our close relatives, sweethearts and friends.<br/><br/>I believe that is the best way.<br/><br/>Have a nice night!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lantern314" title="lantern314"><img alt="lantern314" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lantern314">lantern314</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219938/#Comment_219938" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T15:59:09+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  3:59PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">@Wolfe</a> "Playing before you play" makes so much sense to me.

I've had very similar experiences. I created a Paladin with a secret in a D&amp;D; game, and did my best to play as a Paladin, rushing into danger to save my allies, having a zero tolerance stance toward evil, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat character was defeated, captured then eaten by gnolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy next character was a Cleric of Kord. He annoyed some of the other players because he was damned near a fighter, carrying a massive great sword and getting into tavern brawls. Dude was a Cleric of <i>Kord</i>, the deity whose nickname was "The Brawler". He was seriously fun to play, and though he had a notable amount less backstory, he was still pretty richly described.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference? I made him to fit the type of D&amp;D; game we were playing. Trad ol' bog standard D&amp;D;, where battles are tactical wargames, where roleplaying was important, but took a backseat to the game aspect. Kendhasha (the Paladin) was more suited to the type of D&amp;D; that another group of my friends (in California) play, where the DM takes pains to weave the characters into the story, and weave story around the characters. Interactions between them share a much higher level of prominence than in standard play. It may be telling that almost all the members of this Cali group knew each other through a tavern-based online FFRP community, which was how *I* knew them as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the level and type of description doesn't exist in a vacuum. 3:16 and Mikael's game (what's it called?) call for light description, then playing balls to the wall with what little you have, because if you're lucky you might have long enough to get to know the character, but probably not. Games where you're going to be playing in a scenario that has nothing to do with your character call for more generic description and a flexible backstory (or none). Games where the story is built from bits of your character require that there are lots of bits for the story to be built from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220040/#Comment_220040" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T05:18:02+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  5:18AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've recently finished writing a game where almost anything and everything can be a character: a ceremony can be solemn, a gust of wind playful, a nation proud and vindictive. The only character creation occurs when you narrate an activity which reveals a character (e.g. a ceremony, a gust of wind or  a nation) with a purpose.
