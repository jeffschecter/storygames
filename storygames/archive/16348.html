The contest had two "guest" judges that are co-designers for a very popular and successful board game franchise.  During the contest, the judges had full access to the written rules and components of my game.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, I found a relatively new game (published in 2011) on Board Game Geek that is astonishingly similar to the game I entered in the contest.  The game was designed by the lead designer/creator of the very popular game mentioned above.  I can only imagine that this designer and the two judges from the contest work closely together and share creative ideas all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid the judges pilfer my contest entry for ideas, and share them with the other designer?  I don't want to make accusations at this point, but I feel that the similarities between my game and the published game defy the odds for mere coincidence.  I realize that ideas are cheap, but this is the first time I have ever been able to trace a direct line between my work and someone else's.  Just two degrees of separation.  And the two designs are CRAZY similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be clear, the published game is not a duplication of my design, nor does it copy any part of my written rules.  In other words, I have ZERO legal claim.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I can't help but feel that I've been done wrong.  It seems really unethical to me to just help yourself to someone else's ideas, particularly an aspiring artist in your own field that is struggling for a leg up (the winning prize of the contest was a publishing deal).  If the judges really did pass my ideas on to their buddy with no acknowledgement of their source, I feel my fellow consumers should be made aware of their lack of scruples.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat should I do at this point?  Should I contact the designers and ask for their side of the story?  Should I just suck it up?  Am I just suffering from delusions of grandeur??<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else had a similar experience?  Any words of wisdom would be appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373288/#Comment_373288" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-17T17:47:11+00:00" title="April 17, 2012  5:47PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RoninZombie</cite>What should I do at this point?

We can philosophize over it, I imagine, and hope that some compelling train of thought comes evident to you. Some angles:<br/><br/>I personally think that we need to identify the harm in something like this before we can condemn anybody. Thinking about it, I think that the party in most peril in something like this is the designer who uses ideas from another designer. The important issue is his state of mind: if he saw something he liked and wanted to perfect, then he was not harmed by these events. However, if he took to your ideas desperately, due to lack of confidence or out of a mistaken faith in ideas alone, then his artistic foundations are in grave peril: his friends should question him, whether he's happy working as a vulture of culture. Relying on the inventiveness of others is sand to build upon, so if he did what he did due to an attitude problem, then he's being harmed by his deeds and should stop before it gets any worse.<br/><br/>I don't think that you've been particularly wronged, and neither have the audiences. My opinion on this stems from the nature of culture: for certain reasons modern society tries to pretend like authorship is ownership, but it really isn't much at all like that. Certainly the audiences are not buying for originality, they want quality. As for you, you're not poorer for what happened, I think, not in any way that truly matters. One might speculate about the monetary value of your original design, but whatever that may be, its artistic value is undiminished.<br/><br/>I understand that it hurts to be ignored while another reaps the glory - I know the feeling well enough. But it's pettiness speaking in us - and again, this is harm we cause to ourselves, just like the designer copying others is hurting his own development. Doing something concrete to crusade for justice would be merely petty, and it would unbalance your more important work in improving yourself: you would turn outwards and backwards towards your late work, rather than focusing inwards and towards the future. In this regard you should remember, I think, that even if somebody copied your work, it was <i>your</i> work they copied: you are the one who was good enough to make something worthy, while they were not. This means that yours is the beautiful soul, and it stands to reason that if you would care to, you will surpass them and your own past work in the future. The real reward of your work remains with you, inseparable.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, the above assumes that the adulation of the audience is, ultimately, a secondary goal. We might strive for it, but it does not improve us nor the world, and thus it is ultimately merely something that directs us upon our way, foolish pack animals that we are. In this regard demanding for the adulation when you've already had the artistic satisfaction and the world has had the material benefit of your work is somewhat petty. I suppose I could see it if the plagiarized work had some economic value, and if you were economically victimized here. Doesn't seem very likely in game design, though - it's more of a vocation for free men with the luxury of it.)<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I've seen many beautiful ideas as a judge of game competitions. I've never stood still long enough to consider using some, but I can imagine how the situation might come along. As I intimate up in the second paragraph, I don't see this as worrisome if you have genuine inspiration to push ideas you received from others into some direction of excellence. Culture is stolen from our forebears, and I endorse my right to get excited about stuff and take it further. I have to add that I'd hope that somebody would call me on it if my work stooped to the level of simplistic plagiarism; it'd be quite thoughtless of me were I to lift somebody's ideas entire without acknowledging the dept. Socially inept and thoughtless.<br/><br/>Hmm... looking at the above, I'd say that my practical advice for you is to set this behind you. Maybe even attempt to feel glad for your nemesis' success, if you're feeling particularly saintly. You could optionally do some correspondence with the designer in question and tell him about how his new game looks to you - I'm sure that he'd be happy to tell you a bit about the game's development history, either confirming or debunking your fears. Either way, I'm sure that it would ease your mind to talk this over with the designer. He's the expert on the details of the matter, after all. Also, as can be seen above, I see this sort of situation mostly as a warning signal about the well-being of the plagiarist - he might be in need of help here, it might be a good idea to call on him and see if the pressures of the working life are getting to him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

The contest was organized by a big publisher, in two tiers.  FLGSs and gaming clubs could organize a local contest for their city, the winner moving on to the final, national round.  The club that organized my local event invite the guest judges in on their own accord.  Judges had no affiliation with the organizing publisher.<br/><br/>As you say, imitation is flattery.  I would love to Kickstart my game.  The contest was the first time I had ever exhibited a game in public, and I got a lot of positive feedback from perfect strangers.

You can <a href="http://corvidsun.com/2010/09/12/chasing-jason-fiasco-danger-mtn-geiger/" rel="nofollow">read my shock in the subtext of this post</a>. It gnawed in my gut for over a year, but then I talked to him about it and it turned out he'd never even read it, much less played it. We'd just both been playing too much PTA and longing for a GM-less one-shot game that could do movies about people you enjoyed watching get totally fucked. Turns out it's a common desire! (cf. Zombie Cinema, Dead of Night, Final Girl, etc.)<br><br>Don't let this bother you any more than it has to. Send the designer an email and say like: "Hey, I just saw your new game and it seems like it's in the same vein as one I've been working on" and see if they bite. Throwing accusations around feels really good at first but ultimately doesn't get you anywhere and makes you feel like an asshole. Personally, I'm not sure when I'll be excited enough about Geiger Counter to actually finish it, but that's not Jason's fault.  Really, I lost steam on it long before Fiasco came along and did a bunch of the things I intended Geiger Counter to do.  Honestly, it sounds like you're in a similar position.<br/><br/>Maybe it's killed your excitement about your game for now. That's too bad, but not really a huge loss in the long run. You'll come up with ideas that are even better and make those games instead. Like other people have mentioned, you can even build on the other designer's mistakes or oversights, since they took the first shot at turning a similar concept into a full-fledged product and are bound to have not done it exactly perfect.  For example, in my mind, Fiasco should be like 75% shorter and have its playsets printed on cards. Then it could reach even more jaded hipsters and washed-up geek celebrities! (Yeah, there might still be some bitterness buried under there, even though I've tried to dig most of it out. Life is a process.)<br/><br/>To sum up, I've been there and I feel your pain. Push on through, come out the other side, and keep on making beautiful things.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373306/#Comment_373306" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-17T19:08:07+00:00" title="April 17, 2012  7:08PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2012 7:11PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, Jonathan's feelings mirrors mine regarding Zombie Cinema and Fiasco.

I mean, I'm sure I'd have been jealous of Geiger Counter if J. had published it in commercial form the same year I did ZC, I'd have been convinced that he was stealing my thunder <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Aside from the feelings of frustration, the Fiasco thing is educational on another point: although there are similarities, these are independent works that just happen to be similar. Your case could be similar, although I get the impression that the similarities are greater than those between e.g. ZC, Geiger Counter and Fiasco, which are ultimately just similar in terms of creative agenda, structuralist drama theory and some procedural basics. (So, about as similar as D&amp;D and T&amp;T.) The only way to know is to read the attributions section of the game text (and then ask the designer directly, because boardgame designers have a lot to learn about ludographies).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>For example, in my mind, Fiasco should be like 75% shorter and have its playsets printed on cards.</blockquote>\nYeah, if you were wondering back home, Jonathan's talking about Zombie Cinema here. Uncanny <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Sadly, the exact opposite is true - Fiasco is, as far as I can discern, such a huge success exactly because of its hyperdetail. (The theme is like 40% of the success, too, as far as I discern. Still.) Makes it a boring read for us, but definitely not to the majority of the audience who need that detail.<br/><br/>The point is, us Fiasco wounded can get over it, and so can you, Mike.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373308/#Comment_373308" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-17T19:29:44+00:00" title="April 17, 2012  7:29PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2012 7:30PM by Graham.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, drop them a friendly email, if it's bothering you.<br/><br/>I was personally appalled that Fiasco was <i>clearly</i> lifted wholesale from The Shab Al-Hiri Roach, which I wrote.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

The respect of someone like that is of no value.</blockquote>\n<br/>Ronin, also remember that you're <i>not</i> a peer. You're a guy who entered a contest. Publish your game, then laugh with them or at them. Until you do you're an amateur designer. If that's what you want to be, that's great. But like it or not, that's how things work in every industry where professionals and hobbyists cross-pollinate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373320/#Comment_373320" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-17T20:23:02+00:00" title="April 17, 2012  8:23PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be honest, I'm sort of interested in the game you are mentioning, solely because I could probably pick out 3 or 4 other games that your target game has "stolen" from.<br/><br/>Unless your game had something, REALLY something, unique about it, I wouldn't put to much worry about "hey, they stole my idea!" Since, in the same vien, someone else could make the claim that your game is stealing from theirs. So much of the game design industry is about borrowing bits and pieces from other works and mixing them up differently.<br/><br/>Having said that, there's no reason to not contact the designers in question and voice your concerns in a diplomatic fashion. If the game was produced in 2011, there's a good chance that the publishing deal was actually put in place a full year before you even entered the contest (well, depending on the publisher and the complexity of game, of course). But from everyone I talk to who is a publisher/had a game published, it usually takes over a full year from when the contracts are signed to when the product is actually pushed out the door.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373474/#Comment_373474" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T13:23:33+00:00" title="April 18, 2012  1:23PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Note that <a href="http://www.godsmonsters.com/Features/copyright-game-rules/" rel="nofollow">game rules are not protected</a>, at least in the US.
