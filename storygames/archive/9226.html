The idea is that the Big Bad Evil Thing is so big and so bad that it needs to be killed over the course of hundreds of years, and one family is forced to take it down alone.<br/><br/>We'd start off in dark ages Europe, with one ill-equipped family being forced to deal with weirdzo magic horrors. A vampire infestation during a crusade, perhaps! Then we'd skip ahead to when the descendants of the family are discovering that the stories their grandpappies told them about the men with pointy teeth might be more valid than they thought. Every few sessions would see a change in time and place and a change in the nature of the threat.<br/><br/>I'd want to hit up a few interesting times (colonial America? Boxer rebellion China?) and see how different family members were reacting to being forced into supernatural guardianship.

Maybe you already have one in mind, but ... <br/><br/><a href="http://www.conspiracyofshadows.com/" rel="nofollow">Conspiracy of Shadows</a> is PERFECT for this! And, it's currently free.<br/><br/>Specfically: <br/><br/>1) The game's setting is a fantasy Europe. It has lifepaths EASILY portable to the "real" Europe. There are Spanish analogs, eastern Euro analogs (Polish, I think), several others (Mogol horde, Rus/Viking type dudes, etc.).<br/><br/>2) The entire system is built to have a "team" of heroes resisting a horrorible Conspiracy. The evil vampires are a perfect fit. <br/><br/>3) The game has a really fun system for the broader campaign. Basically, each session you roll to see which side is winning. Eventually, one side gets 'beaten' and you reach a Milestone. This is ideal for how you could jump to future generations -- whenever you reach a milestone, fast forward to Age of Enlightenment antics! Neat.<br/><br/>It's definitely worth a look!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204091/#Comment_204091" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T06:36:59+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  6:36AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That wasn't what I was thinking but I like your idea much better, Lance!
