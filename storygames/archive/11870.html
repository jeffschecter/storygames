In other words, mail order from the US is a hassle for the average consumer.<br/><br/>I have retail experience and good people skills.<br/>I'm knowledgeable.<br/><br/>Give me your thoughts!<br/>Would it be worthwhile to explore this idea further?<br/>What factors should I be considering in my "market research", that might not otherwise be obvious?<br/>What kinds of things would I want to look at stocking?<br/>Store owners: advice for the rookie?<br/><br/>I'm picturing, in the best of all worlds:<br/>a place where I (/employees) dress snappy, are expertly knowledgeable about games, carry a boutique selection, happily mail-order things for our customers, hold weekly board game nights, stock lots of the new classics of board games (Settlers of Catan, Al-hambra, Ticket to Ride, Smallworld, etc), stock roleplaying games (both trad and indie), stock fun cheap gateway games (Gloom, Citadels, Munchkin), and perhaps Magic.<br/><br/>A place that says "this is a place where kids and grown-ups can comfortably shop together".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264994/#Comment_264994" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-01T14:52:57+00:00" title="April  1, 2010  2:52PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of import: I'll be living with my mother when I move, so if I were to open a store and it were to barely break even in its first year of operation, I'd still be sitting relatively peachy.

Sad but true. Read up on entrepreneurial literature. Is there a local small business organization you can get in touch with? (we have local chambers of commerce and the Better Business Bureau here in 'Merica that have lots of resources for small businesses). Make a business plan with hard goals and measurable metrics. Do the research ahead of time so you know how much capital you'll need to sink up front. Prepare to fail (most small businesses do). Prepare to learn from failure. Get help to do things you're not good at (like, if you're not good at money, get an accountant. It'll be worth it). <br/><br/>And yah, ping game store owners, for sure. I think the idea of being a Canadian mail-order center for imported books and games is a really good idea - find out if anyone else in Canada is doing it, and how they manage it. I imagine it means you'll be absorbing the customs costs, right, so figure out what else you'll be doing that will enable you to afford doing that. Figure out what that would mean for taxes.<br/><br/>Um, hopefully some helpful thoughts?

Maybe it is different in Canada. As a comparison, the city of Iisalmi, which is the closest city from where I live, has a bit over 20 000 people. The surrounding region has another 20 000 people for perhaps a total of 40 000 people who might be expected to do their specialty shopping in Iisalmi. There are no game stores in Iisalmi, unless you count one dedicated toy store that mostly sells puzzles, action figures and dolls, with a small sideline in Warhammer and boardgames. My first reaction to the idea of having a game store in Iisalmi is sceptical - I could just imagine pulling it off with a wide net approach relying heavily on videogame business, but it would be far from a sure thing; I'd have to be able to consistently beat the large supermarkets as a destination for gift shopping and family-oriented custom. That'd in turn require a good location and a clever shop front that'd invite the mainstream customer to check out the store.<br/><br/>Game stores in Finland seem to exist in cities that service over 100 000 people in their region. Is the market that different in Canada? I could totally believe that the market is underdeveloped in Finland, especially concerning video games, but then it seems to me that the average supermarket offers wicked competition when it comes to anything remotely mainstream in gaming - a specialty store couldn't sell the latest Playstation or XBox hit game any better than the supermarkets do, for instance. And if we discount the video game market (or just specialize with a boutique selection of rare offers), that'll also cut most of the turnover from the equation, again indicating a larger population base. The same goes for any other remotely mainstream type of gaming product - CCGs are sold at small corner stores, popular boardgames like Catan are sold by those supermarkets.<br/><br/>Hmm... perhaps the Finnish game retail market is not so much underdeveloped but rather co-opted and hypersaturated by mainstream retail outlets. What's the situation in Canada, and your target town specifically? Can the average teenager get their Magic or Pokemon boosters from the corner store, or could something like that be your bread and butter product? That might be a fruitful approach in thinking about this - are there any specific gaming products that are actually proven sellers that are not available in your target area from other, competitive outlets? Of course you won't find roleplaying games in any local stores, I imagine, but then those aren't going to make your bottom-line, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265001/#Comment_265001" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-01T15:19:12+00:00" title="April  1, 2010  3:19PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ndp</cite>Um, hopefully some helpful thoughts?

It's a matter of customer loyalty, and a matter of nerd pride. So, I'd be banking on stealing the CCG/D&amp;D base away from disinterested cigar shops.<br/><br/>The majority of my potential product base is un-catered, and where it is catered, it is generally catered without interest.<br/><br/>Here's the considerations:<br/><br/>*You can't buy Settlers of Catan, Smallworld or Arkham Horror anywhere in town<br/>*You can only buy D&amp;D, Warhammer &amp; Magic from a cigar shop in the mall (not downtown), from someone who doesn't have any knowledge or interest<br/>*No one holds booster drafts, board game nights, etc<br/><br/>*Nelson is a liberal, artsy college town<br/>*There's a huge snobby, against-the-grain artists community<br/>*There's also lots of specialty shops, and an interest in them, generally<br/><br/>*There are only 10,000 people in town, and at max there's a 25,000 person customer base.

If Canadian customs really are that much of a pain for the average user, then you could easily buy in bulk ("bulk" being relative in the RPG world) and cut down on that aggravation, particularly once the customs guys get used to you. In this situation:<br/><br/>Canadian consumers win because its cheaper to pay you a share of dealing with customs in bulk than handle it all themselves.<br/>You win because consumers will pay you money that would otherwise go elsewhere.<br/>Customs wins because they deal with one large order rather than many small ones.<br/>Publishers win because it becomes easier to get product to Canadian consumers.<br/><br/>One drawback is initial capital. You might be able to get around that by running your service sort of like a commune. For example, solicit orders for a certain book, with everyone knowing that they are buying into a communal order that goes out once, say, twenty people are buying the same book. You are just managing the pool, so to speak.<br/><br/>RPGs are a decent product for something like this because demand would not likely get insane, yet, when you were ready, you could extend the "buying pool" idea to other products.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265011/#Comment_265011" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-01T15:56:15+00:00" title="April  1, 2010  3:56PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If mail order were the central idea, then actual store space is a waste of time, at least initially.

Selling board games and RPGs will draw in gamers. Selling video games and comics and DVDs and office supplies will draw in all kinds of people. People who might be there to pick up some index cards might start asking questions about D&amp;D. Find out what else this little town lacks and see if you can fill more than one niche. The real cost is the square-footage. Once you cover that, why not dedicate some floor space to synergistic products?<br/><br/>I'm concerned that 10,000 people isn't large enough to support a gaming market though. I grew up in a town of 5,000 people. I can list the names of the people who gamed (RPGs), because I gamed with them. It's about 10 people, but that was the 80's and 90's. So let's say this community has 25-50 role-players. If one in five of them regularly buys products (like picking up a $35 game book once a month), then your gross income from RPGs is $200-350 a month. I don't know what your profit margin is; let's say 10%. Your net income from RPGs is $20-35. <br/><br/>Obviously, you're not going to keep the doors open selling just RPGs. In fact, your profits on the snacks will probably net you more than the games you sell.

We have one comic store and have two competing game stores with almost identical merchandise (mostly warhammer, D&amp;D and Magic). We used to have another game store that focused on board games and family games with CCGs and CMGs.They had a big ebay business in the CMGs. The two stores that are still here skate by on very low profit. I've heard that one of them only stays open because the owner basically has a trust fund, so it doesn't have to make money.<br/>The board game store has more to offer as far as information for you. They couldn't keep enough Apples to Apples in stock. I think that the key to small town game stores is that you have to carry games like that that will bring in non-gamers. One thing that they did wrong IMO is that they didn't carry any of the other Out of the Box games. I think that people buying AtA would have seen similar packaging, same company and bought more. Another mistake that they made is that they always had a copy of Cosmic Encounter or Descent for sale. Those are big popular games, but there are only a few groups in a city this size that will buy them. Keeping them stocked and taking up space is a big investment for something with a low demand. <br/>They told me that RPGs didn't sell. People either stole PDFs or bought from Amazon. <br/>The ebay business was a hassle and lots of frustration for them, even though it brought in money. That frustration was ultimately what drove them out of business. The reward was not worth the effort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265181/#Comment_265181" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T11:51:38+00:00" title="April  2, 2010 11:51AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>What are commercial properties going for in that area right now?

It's just one of those sober-doses-of-reality things - make sure all your bases are covered, and you're still gonna make mistakes. That's just how things work.<br/><br/>So, I worked at a game store in high school (owned by the folks who used to do Wargames West, which they transferred to after shutting down the mail order operation), and was really actively engaged in it for a couple years. Some perspective from that experience:<br/><br/><b>What I Liked</b><br/><br/>- Provided free gaming space. You could just sit down whenever. There were scheduled events that took priority, obviously, but generally you wouldn't get the evil eye for using the tables even if you didn't buy anything.<br/><br/>- Lots of board games. We were in the same city as Rio Grande Games, so we had almost their entire line, plus all the usual suspects. Also, we carried chess and checker sets, some of them really nice, and their was a 3D chess display out for the entire time I worked there. <br/><br/>- Peripherals. There were two racks of nerd-related bumper stickers that actually sold really well. They carried shirts for a while but I think they didn't sell well enough to justify re-ordering. Dice, of course. All the little WoD accessories (clan pins, etc). Coke machine. <br/><br/>- Events. The store did a good job of hosting all the sanctioned Magic tournaments it could, as well as L5R and a couple others. They also had occasional D&amp;D things. This was in addition to store-sponsored weekly tournaments, etc. This meant that there were almost always people in the store, which is good. Even if they're not shopping, having people in your store makes it less intimidating for people to just walk in and shop.<br/><br/>- Proximity to food. There were three different places you could get good, cheap food within 10 minutes walk, and the store was cool with you having food.<br/><br/>- Friendly atmosphere. I mean, there were directives to always greet everyone who came in the door, learn peoples names, and ask if they needed help. Obviously that can be forced and unappealing, but the idea of being friendly (as opposed to some game stores I have known, where the person behind the counter has literally just stared at me until I try to give them money) is for the win.<br/><br/><b>What I Didn't Like</b><br/><br/>- The RPG selection became more limited over time, finally coming down to pretty much whatever White Wolf and Wizards had put out in the last year. You could special order stuff, of course, but even by the time I left people would rather order from Amazon than special order through the store, because it was cheaper and faster. And the main revenue streams were card games (mostly Magic and Yu-Gi-Oh), Warhammer minis and board games.<br/><br/>- Nerd Entitlement. There were always people who came in just to tell you about their character. As an employee, I couldn't really do anything about it unless there was another customer who clearly was ready to buy something. But there was definitely a core of dudes who had been coming to this store (in one form or another) for years and years, so they felt like they could hang around, not playing or buying anything. They annoyed me. Dunno if there's much you can do about that.<br/><br/>- Didn't keep up. The store found a model that works (magic/yu-gi-oh + warhammer + board games, lots of events, membership program with discounts), and I don't think ever evolved beyond it. That is, I don't have the sense that the management really kept up with developments in the gaming world beyond what distributors are carrying at any given time - going back there is like going back to the early 2000's for me, and even then it wasn't that different from the late 90s store that I first started going to. They're still in business, but it's not a very...exciting place.<br/><br/>So, some more thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265349/#Comment_265349" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-03T13:25:32+00:00" title="April  3, 2010  1:25PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The world of business, as I have hyperbolically said, is alien to me, so most of this thread is gibberish to me, but hopefully this will help. I talked to a business guy one time, and he said that the best advice he ever got when launching a new enterprise was to write down, physically, the conditions under which he would fold the business and pack his tent.  That way if, like most business enterprises, it was an abject yawning abyss of crushing failure, he had some objective measure of how much he was willing to tolerate before he said "nope, not working" and moved on.  This kept him from falling into the entrepreneur's hell, shackled to a business which does worse and worse with every passing moment, but constantly hoping that it will turn around.  Hopefully you never reach the conditions you write down, but if you decide on them in advance, you have a good sense of how much utter failure and crippling depression you're willing to endure, and aren't pushing yourself to suffer more for the sake of something that will never give you what you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265524/#Comment_265524" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T21:28:56+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  9:28PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2010 9:30PM by Wordman.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another random idea... if the town really is "arty", I'd wager at least some of the people are interested in fantasy art.

I can list the names of the people who gamed (RPGs), because I gamed with them. It's about 10 people, but that was the 80's and 90's. So let's say this community has 25-50 role-players.</blockquote>\nI thought the roleplaying hobby was shrinking, not growing 2.5-5x of what it was 'back in the heyday'. <br/><br/>Two on-topic thoughts for internet reading:<br/><br/>On Boardgamegeek, every month or so, someone starts up a thread about how they want to start up a game store, and there's usually some pretty good advice given. I'm not even sure where in their forums to find these threads, but they should exist (or you could post your own).<br/><br/>On RPG.net, Marcus King has a column called <a href="http://www.rpg.net/columns/list-column.phtml?colname=counter" rel="nofollow"><i>Behind the Counter</i></a>. Now there are a lot of people out there who have strong negative opinions of him (he's done his fair share of foot-in-mouth to be sure), but I find that I've pretty regularly read his column, and I have no interest in owning or running a store. To me, one of the column's strengths is that he talks a lot about how he has changed his business focus over the years and found success.<br/><br/>But there's been a lot of good advice to be had upthread, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265562/#Comment_265562" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T07:30:09+00:00" title="April  5, 2010  7:30AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eryops</cite>I thought the roleplaying hobby was shrinking, not growing 2.5-5x of what it was 'back in the heyday'.</blockquote>\nWell, my estimates accounted for Nelson being twice the population of my hometown, and I'll bet there are more gamers now than there were in the 80's. My hometown in the 80's: 1 gamer per 500 people. My estimates for today's Nelson: 1 gamer per 200-400 people. So not quite 2.5 to 5 times! 1.25 to 2.5 times, and I was being optimistic. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Starting a Game Store in a Small Town - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11870/starting-a-game-store-in-a-small-town/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Starting a Game Store in a Small Town - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11870/starting-a-game-store-in-a-small-town/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Nelson is such a beautiful city.

thinking about it.<br/><br/>You could work the field for your store by starting a convention, which in turn will help people network and cohere as a hobby scene. It'll also be major marketing for your plans if you'll make it clear from the start that you're planning to open a store if the local scene seems like it could work. Then, after three conventions a couple of months apart, when you finally open your store, you can move the convention into an in-store event and rake in the networking and marketing benefits of having a thriving local convention that brings out all the local hobbyists into one place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265636/#Comment_265636" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T12:11:29+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 12:11PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2010 12:12PM by Leonard Balsera.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eryops</cite>On RPG.net, Marcus King has a column called<a href="http://www.rpg.net/columns/list-column.phtml?colname=counter" rel="nofollow"><i>Behind the Counter</i></a>.</blockquote>\nFor what it's worth, I enjoy reading Lloyd Brown's <i>Business of Gaming Retail</i> column, on the same site.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ping" title="ping"><img alt="ping" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41dd9b29bf2b05c9bd9b60bb5a720410?s=32&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D32&amp;r=G"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ping">ping</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265671/#Comment_265671" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T15:10:45+00:00" title="April  5, 2010  3:10PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2010 5:45PM by ping.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So in reading your statement \u201cthis is a place where kids and grown-ups can comfortably shop together\u201d \u2013 I can recommend you talk to Scott and Brian at Seattle\u2019s <a href="http://bluehighwaygames.com/" rel="nofollow">Blue Highway Games</a>, a boardgame/D&amp;D store just dipping their toes into story games with a Mouse Guard summer camp. In a short time with a very clear focus, IMHO they have created one of the, if not the best, all around, community game stores in Seattle. This is what I see is their customer satisfaction formula (talk to them for the business formula): \n<ul>\n<li>Family-friendly space \u2013 Clean, bright and warm with a clean bathroom. Sounds obvious, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s been in some seriously dark, industrial, dirty, cluttered game stores. No parent wants to encourage their kids or spend their dollars on what looks like the road to becoming a social outcast.</li>\n<li>Community, Community, Community \u2013 afterschool/library programs, summer camps, tournaments targeted at every age bracket and type of game they sell. They go into the community, not just expect everyone to come to them.</li>\n<li>Actively strive to lower barriers to fun. They have an extensive free game library anyone can use, late night open gaming on weekends until 11pm but frequent special events to draw people in that way too. They appear to train their staff to be attentive and to teach the games to the customers as needed. They say all you have to do is show up and you'll have a game to play. As a result of all these things, Fri and Sat nights are consistently packed.</li>\n</ul>I toured <a href="http://endgameoakland.com/" rel="nofollow">Endgame</a> in Oakland recently, an amazing store with the best indie game selection I\u2019ve ever seen, and they seem to have related philosophies. Both Endgame and Blue Highway have enough real estate for separate retail and play spaces, with the play space in back or above so as not to interfere and distract from the retail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265683/#Comment_265683" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T16:53:12+00:00" title="April  5, 2010  4:53PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I think the Mouse Guard Camp is sheer genius. There's someone in Oakland (not EndGame) who rents out space in a comic store to run D&amp;D games with an educational bent. And has been doing so for 5-10 years, so I'm guessing she's invested in her world. But Mouse Guard is such an approachable subject matter for kids, and a great way to outreach to the community.<br/><br/>Hopefully I can check out Blue Highway when I am in Seattle this June.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aik" title="Aik"><img alt="Aik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aik">Aik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265835/#Comment_265835" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T17:01:41+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  5:01PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've noticed that the local game/comic shops have become very manga-heavy over the past few years - perhaps something to look into?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11870/starting-a-game-store-in-a-small-town" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11870/starting-a-game-store-in-a-small-town" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11870/starting-a-game-store-in-a-small-town/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11870%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11870%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
