Fred took us into the front hall, we looked around and started walking through walls. after a bit we come back to the rules and enjoy them for a while, too; but the free-formy part (which has a whole bunch of unspoken agreements on how we players interact &amp; so on) and the mechanical engine do very different things for me, and i'm sure the same is true for my co-player.<br/><br/>so yes, i think we take games where we think they want us to go; this is not where the writer intended but where we wanted to go in picking up the book.<br/><br/><br/>b)<br/>i think that so much of this question is about space.<br/>in the world, we are crowded by technologies to the point that our human interactions are pushed out to the edges. therefore less community, less connection, less happiness.<br/>we have not yet hit the point in game design or the indie games renaissance where we are crowded; we simply have options.<br/>i read a magazine article a decade ago about how richard garfield wanted to have there be so many magic cards (for the collectible card game) that no one player could keep track of them all. perhaps that one game could be in danger of this, but for the most part, i feel very blessed to be present in this community &amp; renaissance, and have what i see as a very navigable number of options in the way of games, and very clear directions in which to grow in our design. <br/><br/>when walking to the food co-op the other night, i stopped under a series of bare trees and thought about how lucky i am to have these ideas for games that will help people, actually help people communicate and grow stronger together. it is only through the breadth of games available that i am able to study, and to understand. without all this, i would still be selecting spells from lists based on how much damage they did.<br/><br/>but speaking about technology- we have gone too far, and we are totally fucked.<br/><br/>c)<br/>i would agree that the "Amish" are the people who don't know that they are playing it wrong, and are loving it; though i don't think it's really applicable, nor useful.<br/><br/><br/>thanks for providing those quotes and some lovely thoughtfulness after dinner. <br/>(i had mashed potatoes with carrots and onions, the rice and beans aren't ready yet. oop, better go take those off, in fact.)<br/><br/>-jackson                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182745/#Comment_182745" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T21:02:42+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  9:02PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Duh.

Though my friends often joke about how i eat the same thing for dinner whenever i cook for myself, i enjoy<br/>an entire menu of options for games to play. The novelty alone is worth while!<br/>so, uh, thanks, i'll have fun with my library! ; )<br/><br/><br/>&amp; Mike, <br/>i think because one person's happiness is so hard to compare to another's. like, you went out dancing last night, i stayed in and watched a movie. did you have more fun or did i? &amp; beyond that, which was happier? it's so subjective, i don't think it can be compared.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183280/#Comment_183280" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T23:59:59+00:00" title="December 13, 2008 11:59PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: happiness &amp; subjectivity:<br/><br/>Sure, but each of us can compare similar experiences of our own, and make a good guess.

What I write, game or story, I put what I created out into the world, and at that point it isn't mine anymore (except in the sense that I get credit for it, and money, if there's any to be had). It belongs to whoever picks it up. They have their own experiences with it, and that's great.<br/><br/>As to the OP's question, I think it's important to note that firstly, happiness is overrated in American culture - Americans tend to desire "happiness," which is amorphous and elusive, while other cultures tend to work for "satisfaction" or "importance" or "the happiness of my loved ones," all more achievable goals - and secondly, we don't know <i>how</i> these researchers defined happiness in their study.<br/><br/>So, my answers to your questions:<br/><br/>Firstly, I think that the abundance of games out there is absolutely a good thing, which has expanded and deepened our gaming experience. The fact that I can play D&amp;D when I want a linear, hack 'n slash experience of fantasy-heroism-flavored wargaming, dip into White Wolf's games when I'm interested in an equally linear but more narratively complex storytelling experience, mess around with Dogs in the Vineyard or Don't Rest Your Head when what I'm looking for is a linear but ideologically and thematically focused game, and then branch out to the edgier stuff, like In A Wicked Age, for nonlinear, non-character-centric, shared storytelling (or, hell, even Polaris, which I didn't like much) means that I have the right game for the right mood no matter what.<br/><br/>Secondly, I think the equivalent of the Amish in the roleplaying community are the people who cut themselves off from the marketplace of game ideas. For good or ill, they have picked the play philosophy that works for them, and they experience nothing but that. Are they happier than those of us who continue to wrangle with what game we want to play tonight? Maybe they are. They certainly spend less money on books! It's important to note, though, that there is no difference in this regard from someone who solely plays D&amp;D and someone who only plays Polaris or Burning Wheel. They're both Gamish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
