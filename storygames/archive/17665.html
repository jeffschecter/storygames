At first I was a little sceptical since it seemed like it would add handling time, but as you already have the Harm move in AW normally, it's the same. It makes damage more visceral and its sort of harder to tell how close to being dead you are, since the rolls can give wildly varying results dependent on the situation and result of the Harm roll. I really like how the current Harm move effects are worked into these 3 moves as minor effects, very clever.<br/><br/>I'm 5 sessions into an AW game now and am seriously considering introducing these - I have two badass combat characters with 2 Armour each (Quarantine and Gunlugger) and getting a scratch on them is difficult, this would add a level of uncertainty to the fights, make them seem less invulnerable without actually taking away those playbook's strengths. <br/><br/>I also found myself slipping into a hit point type mentality with the Harm segments - the Brainer got injured to 9 oclock last session and it was only the results of the healing move  that brought home the seriousness of the injury (recovery involves 36 hours of constant monitoring and passing in and out of consciousness) rather than the infliction of the injury itself.<br/><br/>Only thing I wonder about is how the long list of serious effects works with character mortality. On the face of it, it looks like an improvement, since actual PC fatalities looks less likely due to the number of effects you can apply before death, but there are some hard, unpalatable choices along the way which make fights scary even though they're less likely to write your character out of the game altogether.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400072/#Comment_400072" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-08T02:31:38+00:00" title="December  8, 2012  2:31AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2012 2:32AM by Colinaut.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400073/#Comment_400073" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-08T02:31:38+00:00" title="December  8, 2012  2:31AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are excellent!

Was this the thing that was bothering you when you started the 'blissed out' discussion, or did you come upon this afterwards?<br/><br/>The core moves are awesome and intuitive enough once you figure out that it's a kind of step-ladder thing between the three.<br/><br/>There are a few minor things that I'd change if it was my game:<br/><br/>"Effect" sounds a bit a sterile. The list isn't only there to be pick off of, it's there to invoke colour, right? I'd go for a non-swearword if I could think something up, but otherwise... "Minor shit" and "Serious shit" might be better. Maybe "Minor hurt" and "Serious hurt"?<br/><br/>For the "when something seriously scare hits you" move, I'd treat the miss slightly differently, invoke some fear of consequences right there. "On a miss, you're seriously fucked up, the MC will tell you how. You can choose to die instead." As a MC, you want some point in the system where you are no longer limited by the list. Making someone who's already blind, broken and unconscious also deaf feels weird, but so will choosing the 'dead' options when there are others around.<br/><br/>The armour numbers jubbling thing is weird. Instead of granting +1 across the board for every move, I'd just grant every single character the possibility of +1 armour by making use of the environment (safety gear for savvies working on electronics, cover for 'luggers in firefights, tinfoil hats for targets of brainers, etcetera).<br/><br/>-2 for +1 harm moves seems like too good a deal, and would leave splattered corpses out of unarmored characters near every time. How about just granting a free minor effect instead? You get into a fistfight with the Merciless Battlebabe, she leaves you a scar no matter how you're armored.<br/><br/>Also, since you're going the narrative route, NTBFW seems far easier to solve than you made it out to be. Just have the MC treat the Gunlugger like he's fighting as a gang. Offense wise... You know when they say "fights like ten men?". You just make a NTBFW Gunlugger one of those. Similarly... In battle, Gunlugger treats seriously scary shit as if it was stuff that could kill you, and only eats seriously scary shit when it's seriously, seriously scary.<br/><br/><br/>Those bits aside, I really really like what you've done here and what it opens the doors to. *Everything* in the world gets a default custom damage move. Rusty bear traps, moldy water, a punch with a corkscrew. All kinds of stuff becomes mechanically interesting now!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400117/#Comment_400117" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-08T13:59:21+00:00" title="December  8, 2012  1:59PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dopeness.

The "blissed out" conversation is somewhat relevant, but only a tiny bit. This is separate! I still don't totally get the blissed out thing we were discussing in that thread. It seems to me that the effect of that move is that your trouble effectively gets worse if you go to see the Angel. But let's keep that in the other thread!<br/><br/>2. Change the name of "effects" is a great idea! I like "serious shit", except that "choose one serious shit" doesn't flow so well. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>3. You make a good point about adding some uncertainty to the really bad situations. However, the MC choosing a serious effect is already pretty nasty: and, yes, the MC could choose "Dead". I'll think on this one! I like leaving it in the players' hands: you decide whether your character is still worth playing, or whether they should just go the route of the dead and gone.<br/><br/>4. Armour numbers: I wonder if I explained this unclearly. The number jubbling only applies for playbook moves which give armour (like Divine Protection), to make them still worthwhile. Ignore it if you don't like it! <br/><br/>Does my text give the impression that you're supposed to do that kind of math all the time, for all armour numbers? That's certainly not what I meant.<br/><br/>Positioning for a +1 to the harm is not a bad custom move!<br/><br/>5. You think -2 for a +1harm move is too much? Funny, when I was writing it I thought it was too mild (since a complete step up in damage would be +/-3). Can you explain why you think it's over-powered?<br/><br/>6. NTBFW: This is funny. What you wrote there is exactly how I would handle it! Where do we disagree?

I think that your general goal with armour jubbling is providing a general boost to armour scores of about +1 across the board - you're increasing the top armour score to 3, and having a lot of easy to get moves be worth either a flat +2, which is huge, or a +1 for a total of +3, which is even huge-er. A situational +1 armour, keeping in line with the spirit of the "more descriptive" spirit of your hack, would seem to do much the same thing with less rewriting.<br/><br/>That -2 on the roll is too much is speculation, of course, and a playtest would likely clear it right up. But here's why I think that's going to be too much - players don't choose the situation when they get harmed, so they don't use their best stat as much, so they are much more likely to roll 0-armour or 1-armour. And that's a problem because you get a lot of percentage buck for a -2, 'cause that shifts the top of the distribution curve right into miss zone (you fail 72% at a -2, which is a lot of suck for an unarmoured PC to take).<br/><br/>I am not surprised that we imagine NTBFW the same way! In all honesty, I think that with your current harm system, you could leave the NTBFW unexplained and it'd work great. "Counts as a small gang", which naturally amps up damage done by him and damps damage done to him.<br/><br/>If you feel like you need to have the section, then here are the things that stood out the most for me - The original text seems like it considers the Gunlugger to be at par with any gang whatsoever, which should only really be true against small gangs. Some sentences in the document seem downright weird - "They somehow always manage to position themselves so only one member of the enemy gang can effectively harm them at a time."? The fictional constraint seems weird and doesn't mesh with my image of the Gunlugger well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400144/#Comment_400144" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-08T18:06:51+00:00" title="December  8, 2012  6:06PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out the Regiment (AW hack) for gritty harm rules.<br/><a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400147/#Comment_400147" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-08T19:01:56+00:00" title="December  8, 2012  7:01PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2012 7:02PM by John_Harper.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OMG Riddle totally thread-bombed you, Paul T. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I think your harm hack is cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400148/#Comment_400148" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-08T19:49:26+00:00" title="December  8, 2012  7:49PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">@Colinaut</a>:<br/><br/>That's pretty similar to what one version of these rules looked like in development.

The only change is for playbook moves to be more effective. Maybe it's not a good idea? I could be convinced of that. In my experience, any AW character who's expecting a fight can and will get 1-armor (I think all the playbooks give you 1-armor, if you want it), and that's great. The moves, though, they're much harder to get, so I figured I'd boost them a little. I could be wrong on this point!<br/><br/>I'm trying to expand the range of armor, either. By-the-book AW includes 3-armor options, but suggests to be careful with them. It seems to me that 3-armor makes people pretty much invulnerable, though, since NPCs never have the option to choose "inflict terrible harm", and almost all weapons max out at 3-harm. So I've never seen anyone use 3-armor in play. It sounds like you don't, either! But in this hack, 3-armor is just fine.<br/><br/>Your point about the -2 being too harsh is a good one! Again, I'm assuming most AW PCs are wearing fashion worth 1-armor (or have an armor move), but it's true that it's not always the case. Deserves playtesting! But remember that the effects of "inflict terrible harm" should be balanced with "take definite hold of it" and other options. Would a -1 be worth it? Let's discuss it further.<br/><br/>I like your thoughts on NTBFW.

Regarding armour, here's my general thought process. In your hack, armour becomes a +stat, meaning misses are possible even for the best-armoured. This in turn makes 2-armour 'okay' (not-worst result most of the time) and 3-armour 'good' (best or mid result most of the time), same as it is for regular playbook stats. In pre-hack AW though, 3-armour is rare and makes you kind of untouchable.<br/><br/>So what I thought you were doing was making the 2-3 range of armour more prevalent, because that's the range you generally want to go into battle with.<br/><br/>But making Divine armour and Daredevil flat-out 2-armour or +1 to 3 makes the moves a bit too good, because it pretty much takes away a good bit of the need to actually prepare yourself for a fight - for the playbooks that *should* be doing the preparing. Plus, they're already good moves to take unaltered, especially post-hack - Divine armour isn't just 1-armour, it's 1-armour that triggers regardless of the fictional cause. Daredevil's +1 is very powerful as well - anything that can push 2-armour to 3-armour is.<br/><br/><br/>As for the -2/-1 for +1 harm moves... I have to say I'm not a big fan of moves that modify rolls in general, so it might just be that talking. I think it'd be easier to reframe it in terms of a straight-out roll-independant bonus.<br/><br/>Merciless, Bloodcrazed, Inflict terrible harm - whatever harm your opponent rolls, you can always inflict one minor effect, your choice, or up a minor effect into a serious effect of their choice.<br/><br/><br/>As for NTBFW - "You count as a small gang in battle. You dish out and suck up harm like you were ten dudes, so damage you do and damage you take generally counts like a step up or down on the harm moves ladder, respectivelly. Enemy numbers don't become a problem until you're facing gangs medium or larger."<br/><br/>(As an aside, it seems like your hack makes gang warfare far more scary - fire from fifteen guys is now fire from fifteen guys, instead of just 2+1 harm. Interesting!)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400188/#Comment_400188" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T07:33:54+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  7:33AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent! I'll think on it; I'm in the process of a re-write anyway.<br/><br/>As for armor-granting moves, you've made a good case! Let me present mine, and then let's discuss further:<br/><br/>In straight-up AW, armor is very effective. If you have the Battlebabe armor move (forgetting the name at the moment), you get 2-armor if you're running around mostly naked. That literally means you can ignore gunfire (unless it's heavy weapons). Automatically.<br/><br/>If she had just +2 to the harm move, instead, that wouldn't even bump her up into another category (10+) on average. So it's good, but doesn't even <i>reduce</i> the harm (never mind ignoring it altogether!) except on a good roll. <br/><br/>So I was trying to balance those two extremes, split the difference.<br/><br/>But maybe those moves are too effective, anyway.<br/><br/>What do you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400192/#Comment_400192" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T08:51:37+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  8:51AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the problem with the Battlebabe's Insane Reflexes is shared by anything that has 2-armour, including whatever gear the combat-savvy playbooks start with. 2-armour is 2-armour no matter the source.<br/><br/>It's a bit strange that you're balancing armour moves in your hack against AW's baseline effectiveness, but you're not doing the same for gear. The end result is that the armour moves get a bonus relative to what they were worth in default AW - armour moves are now as good as the best default armour, and then some.<br/><br/>Not that that's wrong - there's definitelly a case to be made that default AW armour moves are a bit subpar in comparison to other moves (how many pick Impossible reflexes over Ice Cold or even Visions of death?). I'm not sure that's what you're trying to do, though.<br/><br/><br/>So yeah. I think the problem is that 2-armour, no matter the source, has dropped in effectiveness post-hack, and that's what needs to be solved. Either by something semi-weird like reading the sitch granting armour bonus, or just granting a situational bonus whenever one applies.<br/><br/>If I got you right, you don't care much about 2-armour gear 'cause that's easy enough to get and not as character-defining as moves are (you can always get better armour, but you can only get so many moves), so the only thing of the two that needs upping in effectiveness are the moves.<br/><br/>Maybe that's right! I don't know. It probably depends on how easy it is to buy armour in an AW game. Which, experiences differ, but I haven't really seen happening much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400193/#Comment_400193" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T09:04:29+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  9:04AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D,<br/><br/>Yep, you got me right. I find armour, as written, extremely valuable in AW, and easy to get (you're right that I don't often see people buying it, but that's because most playbooks, if not all, start with armour options). Since most gang write-ups have armour, the implication, in my mind, is that armour is available and easy to get.<br/><br/>If the hack makes it too useless (and I don't think it does, those bonuses are still really handy!), the MC can easily adjust by making 3-armor more available.<br/><br/>Moves are not as easily adjusted in play (you can't just go "buy" one, you need an advance AND an appropriate improvement option available - choose a move from another playbook - plus you're giving up on taking some other move in exchange).<br/><br/>So far I find the idea of armour-granting positional moves weird (mostly because that stuff should already be reflected by what moves you have to make, including which harm move the MC chooses when you're hurt).<br/><br/>But I'm open to further convincing!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400200/#Comment_400200" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T10:28:02+00:00" title="December  9, 2012 10:28AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh! Definitelly granted on the fact that the situational bonus is already kind of baked into how you pick which move to roll for. Hm.<br/><br/>With that, I don't really have a good alternative anymore - I can only tell you why I still find the armour jubbling strange. If these things aren't a problem, cool!<br/><br/>It's not that the hack makes armour useless (well, it does make it less useful, but that's the whole point of the hack, I feel - harm is harm, no fooling around), it's just that it makes it comparativelly less useful to moves than it did in default AW.<br/><br/>I guess I'm looking at armour, and especially 2-armour, more like it's something special - a lesser version of the Savvy's workspace or Driver's car. Only the Gunlugger, Battlebabe and Chopper have 2-armour at start, whereas the Hocus and Skinner don't have any armour at all. The thing that bugs me, I guess, is that the Hocus, Angel or Driver could possibly have an easier time of getting to 3-armour than the fighty playbooks.<br/><br/>Plus, well, messing with the move values is not, uh, 'elegant'. Ignoring the validity of rules-as-rules for now, "you get +1 armour when you're in an appropriatelly defensive position" reads better than "with this move, you have 2-armour, except when you have 2-armour already, in which case it's +1 armour instead."<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, I don't feel like you're getting anything more useful out of me anymore, so I'll pipe down for a bit. Will definitelly use your hack if I get to play AW again anytime soon!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400202/#Comment_400202" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T10:41:26+00:00" title="December  9, 2012 10:41AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> - Personally, I think just one roll is less fiddly as it's nice and concise and a quick read.

It doesn't matter if you are charging in with a guns or swords or fists it's the same roll but the outcome is depending on the fiction. <br/><br/>Either way I do recommend doing a bit of a rewrite of your harm moves just to make them a bit quicker to glean.

I tried it (alone, not with a group, though) the way you're suggesting in version 2 of these rules, and it was a pain in the ass. The MC has to announce how many harm options you're threatened with. Then, instead of just using those choices (which would be a natural assumption), you have to make a roll. Then you have to read how many options to subtract. Now you have to go back and see if you still remember how many options and what kind the MC named ("was it two serious and one minor, again?"). Now you have to choose which ones to reduce and how much. Hmmm, which shall it be? Am I better off taking two minor or one serious? Hmmm. The MC also has to have the option to "upgrade" some of them. Now you have to, again, remember both those figures (the threatened harm options, and how many you just got to ignore), subtract one from the other, and finally use the result to pick results from the list of effects. There are just so many places where it could go wrong.<br/><br/>In this final version you have three different moves, which is not super elegant, but the advantage is that you just make one roll and read your result, then apply it. You only need to read the result you rolled, not all of them, so it shouldn't slow down combat just because there's something to read (it's still less text than most basic moves, like seize by force or seduce/manipulate).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/DWeird">@DWeird</a> - Yes, if you use these rules, you can treat armor as a little more common. But you don't have to! It's a dial that's fine at either setting.<br/><br/>The only problem I can see with ignoring the change to armor-adding moves (and only Daredevil and Divine Protection stack with armor, if I remember correctly) is that people will be less likely to choose them. Maybe. Maybe they'll take them anyway!<br/><br/>Either way, fine by me!<br/><br/>I like the idea of building in some kind of +1 bonus, but I don't see (right now) a way to do it that's not very ambiguous, like the option you've suggested (I feel). What's an "appropriately defensive position", exactly? In a gunfight, do you have to be behind cover? What about in a fistfight? A knife fight? When some rocks fall on you? When you take harm from a Brainer move? It's not clear to me. Most of the ways I can think of to make it MORE clear just make it less likely to be used, which invalidates the whole point of the thing.<br/><br/>I could see going with, "roll at +1 unless you're completely unprepared for the attack." Then you'll get +1 most of the time, unless someone gets the jump on you.<br/><br/>But that's not my goal here: I don't particularly feel the need to move the "baseline" up by one. I just don't want to completely nerf the armor-granting moves.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400219/#Comment_400219" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T14:14:49+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  2:14PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, I dig this very much:\n<blockquote><br/>Merciless, Bloodcrazed, Inflict terrible harm - whatever harm your opponent rolls, you can always inflict one minor effect, your choice, or up a minor effect into a serious effect of their choice.<br/></blockquote>\nThat is definitely better and/or more interesting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I feel that one extra minor effect is maybe too weak, or not the right effect. You're merciless, so when you punch someone they drop their gun? Not sure if this is the kind of thing we're going for. It's close, though! Maybe instead of adding a minor effect, you get to make one of the choices for the player? Hmmm. <br/><br/>Upgrading a minor effect into a serious effect is probably too hardcore for this, though. Especially for not-too-serious harm. I punch you so hard you're bleeding internally? (That's kind of cool, actually. But it seems pretty rough. I'll have to think on this one!)<br/><br/>One other way I thought about doing this is to simply say that when you get a harm modifier like this, you upgrade to the next worst harm move. However, doing it by penalizing their roll is (almost) the same effect, just a little less, which I liked.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400230/#Comment_400230" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T15:41:16+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  3:41PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, honestly, +1 harm is not that big a deal in default, AW, right?<br/><br/>Plus, one minor effect might not seem like much, but it goes along with others you might get. And it'd be something guaranteed - even when other guy is in power armour (3-armour, rolls 13+) or something, you can still punch him straight in the nose and have it do something. *And* it's a minor effect the person who wants what's worst for the target gets to determine. It's not a must-take, but it's a move.<br/><br/>Oh, the writing of the suggested move reflects this poorly, but I intended the basic choice (minor effect or minor effect upgrade into serious effect) to be at the targeted player's discretion.<br/><br/>So, for example, there's a knifefight and the Bloodcrazed Hardholder cuts my Hocus. I roll 13+ somehow, and the guy says "Yeah, you lose grip on your weapon." Then I'm all "What! No, screw that!

I like the revisions to version 2 a lot, but it's still there nagging at me.<br/><br/>It might be that except for a miss on super-bad shit, the player is choosing all their serious wounds and whether they die. It seems like there's no room for the MC to say "you stick your hand in the hole? It gets cut off," but maybe it's not for that? It's for the more chaotic moments of combat? But even then, the MC can't say "he slashes you with his sword and now you're bleeding real bad." Instead it's maybe "I have lots of medical stuff but I can't get to it just now so I'll pick it doesn't heal naturally." In any case, I'm unsure as to how much of an issue that is.<br/><br/>But there's also hit points (or the harm countdown) functioning as the game's definition of when you can't play your character, a metric that everybody can agree on at the beginning, in case MCs are tempted to fudge things so PCs don't die, or in case players think the MC's decision that a wound is fatal is too arbitrary. Or so the game can add a 2-harm cushion so PCs have room to fuck up once before shit really gets real. Again, I'm unsure, because this is something that is really valuable in some situations and totally unnecessary in others.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, what I really DO like about this is that it's another solid step towards taking all the numbers off the character sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400386/#Comment_400386" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T17:37:50+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  5:37PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a similar reaction to Johnstone.<br/><br/>In cases where a move strikes me that way, I usually switch the choices to the MC.

This system doesn't work too well for the "MC just inflicts harm" kind of moments in play. I suppose it always presupposes that there is a chance it could be better or worse, leaving a little ambiguity. So, if you stick your hand into something, or stick it out for your friend to hit it with a hammer, you're still rolling the harm move, which means it could end being not too bad after all, or even worse than expected. "Ok, roll!"<br/><br/>That doesn't bother me too much. Physical damage in real life is extremely unpredictable, I find, even when you wouldn't expect it to be - my father was in the military and he's told me stories about things like this: once during training someone unpinned a grenade and dropped it on the ground. It exploded right between the guy's legs. His coat was shredded but he was basically unhurt, completely miraculously so, just shook up by the explosion.<br/><br/>Another guy, an experienced soldier, threw a fragmentation grenade a very safe distance away (he'd done this dozens of times during his career) and then turned to walk away. A piece of shrapnel hit him in the back and pierced his heart. He was dead on the spot.<br/><br/>I know I've done some pretty crazy shit in my life and come out unharmed, but I also once hopped up and down on a perfectly level surface and my foot just broke.<br/><br/>However maybe a better point is that all harm under this model is presumed to affect the character as a whole. It doesn't model focused harm to a specific body part very well. But then again, neither do hit points.<br/><br/>I suppose you could re-define it on the spot to say that the move is about your hand: "this is something that could kill/destroy <i>your hand</i>", and effects refer to your hand, not your whole self. "Roll!"<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/John">@John</a>, that's a good way to approach it. I don't feel super comfortable telling a player they just lost their arm or anything like that, so I definitely prefer a method like this, where you automatically get player buy-in for harmful shit that befalls your PCs.<br/><br/>I wish I had your confidence in telling a player they were just fucked! "Snip! Your hand's gone. You'll bleed to death if you don't tend to it pretty soon, by the way." That makes me feel tempted to back off and pull my punches sometimes.<br/><br/>Then again, you could easily use this same ruleset and just have the MC pick the effects, no other changes necessary. Why not? But I like making the players choose, it gets buy-in from them as well as feeling like AW (making difficult choices from a list of things).<br/><br/>And also: I'm not sure why plot immunity doesn't apply to your hand getting chopped off when it does to getting shot. In straight-up AW, you'd say: "Something bites your hand/arm. Take 2-harm." And that's the extent of what the game rules have to say about it: if they had no harm to begin with, the character can keep on going pretty much without effect. The equivalent of that in this hack is that you rolled well and didn't suffer a serious effect. <br/><br/>How often do you actually say, "Snip! Your hand is gone."? That would be a rare, rare occurence for me, especially if the players are expecting that hit point buffer to give them a certain safety in the fiction.<br/><br/>(Now, if you're going to use the fictional details of this injury to influence how the character acts going forward, rather than just treating it as abstract harm, that's totally fine, but whatever method you're using in that case... you can use that same method under these rules, it's no different.)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Orlando">@Orlando</a> - I love what you're saying, agree with it in full.<br/><br/>I have no idea how to implement that pipe dream, though. (Unless we're just going to start playing collaborative freeform, of course, but that's a different thing altogether. And then we're back to the MC worrying about whether he should pull his punches and stuff like that.)<br/><br/>For instance, it would be way better with one harm move instead of three. I didn't set out to make three separate moves: I made all kinds of single moves, but I always had to engage in complex math or weird decision trees to make it work. When I finally had the insight to just break it into three different moves, that simplified the system to work. I'd prefer just one move, of course, I'm just not sure how to do it.<br/><br/>If I were to try, I'd do something that ignores harm numbers and armor altogether, something like:\n<blockquote>When your character suffers bodily harm, roll. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1. <br/><br/>* The damage isn't as bad as it seemed it would be, given the circumstances<br/>* You manage to maintain a strong position or the upper hand despite the shock<br/>* You can react immediately, without missing a beat<br/>* You take +1forward.<br/><br/>On a miss, the MC will make a hard move, as usual. It could be about how bad the damage is, or it could be something else.<br/></blockquote>\nWith this move, you'd just look at each other whenever something feels like it could kill you. Someone shoots you in the head? That's gonna kill you. If you want to live, you have to choose the first option ("the damage isn't as bad as it seemed it would be..."). Same goes for wounds getting worse: you negotiate the details between the two of you, and apply another harm roll later if it seems appropriate.<br/><br/>But for this hack I wanted it to work with the existing bits already in the game (like the seize by force move, for instance).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Everyone">@Everyone</a>: it's not immediately apparent, maybe, but this move is pretty well balanced with AW harm in terms of lethality and the effect on characters. It has the same "safety buffer" built it. In fact, that's how I came up with it: I asked Vincent why he used hit points in AW, and he said, "it's plot immunity: there's no way the first shot can kill you". And I thought, hmm, can't you do that without the hit points, though? So I tried and this is what I came up with.<br/><br/>You can adjust the lethality by adding or subtracting dangerous effects. For instance, to make the game less lethal, you could add the following serious effect:\n<blockquote>* You're in shock: for a moment or two, you don't know where you are or what the hell is going on</blockquote>\nSo I don't think these rules change that aspect of AW. It's still deadly and scary but at the same time with a bit of a safety blanket built in, just as in straight-up AW. <br/><br/>The difference, as I see it, is that you'll never have something marked on your harm clock without knowing what it is and how it's doing. (Like if you get healed to 6:00: what do those two remaining points of harm mean? Are you still injured, or just feeling weak? Or are you totally fine, except you've used up some of your luck for now? Same issue as with D&amp;D hit points. I like that in this hack you can just ask the MC: hey, am I still bleeding? If the answer is no, you cross off that effect, period.)<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback. This is an interesting topic: most story games deal with harm either as an abstraction, as colour for a lost conflict, or as a metagame resource thing (like how in Storming the Wizard's Tower losing your hit points means you don't get to play that character in the next session). Very few, if any, try to make it real and visceral. AW seems to invite that treatment, somehow. So it's a fun thing to think about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400408/#Comment_400408" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T20:40:37+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  8:40PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2012 8:40PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A bit late to the thread, but I think my only comment is small: too many minor effects. At all levels. Minor effects (i.e. the effects from the original harm move) are interesting because each one by itself can be made narratively consequential and interesting. Piling 1-2 minor effects on top of nearly every possible harm result is too arbitrarily harsh for my taste -- especially on a 10+ result -- but also, more importantly, it just seems likely to be narratively confusing and overwhelming. <br/><br/>Like, you drop the stuff AND you miss the thing AND you forget about that girl and also, OH RIGHT, <i>your eye is gouged out?</i> It's just getting in the way of the serious effects, when they're there, and it's jumbling up the minor stuff when you have more than one. Sure, you can make it work, but what's the benefit, when all the minor moves are already designed to be super flexible based on the MC's choices?<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400409/#Comment_400409" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T20:49:58+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  8:49PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2012 12:28AM by Johnstone.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Oh man, Orly, he got super-close and then put that +1forward in.

I don't want to have to *analyze* the fiction to see if a guy gets a bone fracture or an artery rupture.<br/><br/>What a good move does is provide clear fictional input (aside from just how good/bad it is for you) and constraints that limit, guide and reinforce what an MC can do (compare: "You're blind now!" "Nuh-uh!" "Uh-huh!" to "Okay, you got shot in the head, so lets say we get the "you're blind" option.").<br/><br/><br/><br/>That said, I would be completelly fine with establishing minor points of harm like "you're bruised", "your gun goes flying away", whether the PC has in general suffered enough minor harm for something serious to be happening instead without ever having to look at a PC-side move.<br/><br/>Maybe the move could be reworked to be about serious harm only?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400450/#Comment_400450" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T07:36:12+00:00" title="December 11, 2012  7:36AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, some thoughts, after some sleep:<br/><br/>1. On losing your hand. This is not really a harm thing, is it?<br/><br/>If the MC says, "your hand is chopped off," that's not "inflicting harm". It's "taking away their stuff". <br/><br/>Naturally, you'd want to inflict harm too ("...and mark off 2-harm"), but it's a separate thing.<br/><br/>Is there some reason why you feel you can take away their stuff under standard AW harm rules (which are equally silent about stuff like cutting someone's hand off), but not under these new rules? How is it different?<br/><br/>2. On the +1forward.<br/><br/>It was the very last one I added to that list. The reason? It's a purely cinematic thing. You can choose to suffer more from an injury (remember, you're choosing it instead of some other option) in order to become enraged or whatever and hit your enemy back harder. Kind of a self-sacrificial move.<br/><br/>I could easily see leaving it out, though, no biggie.<br/><br/>3. I'm with DWeird on the application of this simplified harm move:<br/><br/>* It means we have to throw a big portion of the game (a lot of the stuff about weapons, armor, some of the stuff about healing, and a lot of playbook moves that give harm bonuses or armor bonuses).<br/>* Personally, as MC, I don't like having to make calls about stuff like a character's death in the middle of an important scene. It's nice when the system does the heavy lifting for me there.<br/><br/>For instance, if you get stabbed, we have to negotiate that you're just wounded, not quite dead. The knife's not that big, it's dangerous but not lethal. Now you get stabbed a second time. Are you dead now? What about the third time?<br/><br/>It could work, but I don't think it's done just yet.<br/><br/>My preferred solution would be to give the players some kind of "back door" out of deadly situations (like a recover from deadly harm move or whatever). Then the MC can easily call most harm deadly, and leave it to the players to deal with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Apocalypse World - a more descriptive/visceral approach to harm - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17665/apocalypse-world-a-more-descriptive-visceral-approach-to-harm/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Apocalypse World - a more descriptive/visceral approach to harm - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17665/apocalypse-world-a-more-descriptive-visceral-approach-to-harm/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="(Oh man, Orly, he got super-close and then put that +1forward in.

If a rule can be abused, it will be (somewhere by someone), so I try to think about that when I can, and to see how much of the invisible hand of <del>economics</del> rules design can be used to manipulate players into <del>better</del> more appropriate behaviour. Admonition/guidelines/procedural rules that say "follow he fiction" are fine and everything, but they also <i>assume</i> the reader/user is "on the same page" as you, which I would say is generally sub-optimal to mechanical rules that restrict undesired behaviour and encourage desired behaviour, just by the way they operate.<br/><br/>I was trying to think of how using the rules-as-written could result in choices that don't stem from the fiction, and those are the examples that came to mind. That one includes pressures other than the fiction-being-resolved that might play into a player's decision as to what to pick. And also, you're quite right about losing a hand being take away their resources. I'd even say no, you don't need to make the harm move too. "You're hand gets cut off. What do you do?" Looks good to me!<br/><br/>But like I say -- may or may not be an issue. It's an issue <i>for me</i>, but mainly because I want mechanical rules that manipulate behaviour to the best and most sophisticated degree possible.

If I take the lessons I've gleaned from that thinking, and fold them into my own style, it changes the stuff I've been doing so far and I get this instead:<br/><br/>When you <b><i>suffer harm</i></b>, the MC describes the injury and chooses 1 or more:<br/>* You are bleeding or exposed to ongoing harm.<br/>* You are crippled or disabled in some way.<br/>* You are incapacitated: stunned, trapped, or unconscious.<br/>* You lose track of, or miss noticing, something important.<br/>* You lose your footing, your grip, or your tactical position.<br/><br/>If it\u2019s minor harm (from a fistfight or a fall down the stairs), the MC chooses 1.<br/>If it\u2019s serious harm (caused by a weapon, for example), the MC chooses 2.<br/>If it\u2019s terrible harm (caused by boiling oil or dragon\u2019s fire), the MC chooses 3.<br/>If it\u2019s bodily destructive (like being decapitated or burned at the stake), you die.<br/><br/><b>Armour:</b><br/>If you have armour to protect you, the harm you suffer is lessened\u2014the MC chooses 1 fewer than normal. If it's particularly heavy armour, the MC chooses 2 fewer than normal. If your armour takes away all of the MC\u2019s choices, you can still lose something\u2014the MC can choose either one of those two choices, above. If you have cover, it can also count as armour.<br/><br/><b>Ongoing harm:</b><br/>If you are bleeding or suffering exposure (to radiation, for example, or if you are drowning, freezing, on fire, or in a vacuum) each time you have a chance to deal with it and fail to do so, the MC will pick a new option from the list, that this source of harm has not already inflicted upon you. Once you are incapacitated and still bleeding or exposed, if no one else saves you, you die.<br/><br/>And then:<br/>When you <b><i>recover from trauma</i></b>, roll+stat. On a 10+, you recover quickly and as fully as is possible under the circumstances. On a 7-9, you recover, but either it takes time and attention or it marks you. On a miss, you do not recover.<br/><br/>The recover move of course has a large scope. You fall down and lose consciousness, you want to snap right out of it, roll to recover. You go back to town and lie in bed for a month while the Sisters tend to your wounds, roll to recover. Etc (in case it's not obvious).<br/><br/>The problem there is that the recover move doesn't drop right into AW very well (I mean, what stat, right?) but hey, I love it so much I stick it in every hack I start writing.<br/><br/>EDIT: Also I forgot to say I like the Last Breath rule. It could go well with this. Ignore the effects of an injury until you get a shot at reaching your immediate goal, but then you collapse and die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400527/#Comment_400527" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T20:03:49+00:00" title="December 11, 2012  8:03PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You list is too long man!<br/><br/>When you suffer harm, the MC describes it and chooses 1 or more:<br/><br/>* It's on-going and deteriorating.<br/><br/>Like bleeding out, spiraling depression, PTSD, radiation poisoning &amp;c.<br/><br/>* You're incapacitated.<br/><br/>In shock, disabled, unconscious, hallucinating, panic attack, hysterical &amp;c.<br/><br/>* You lose something important.<br/><br/>A limb, a tactical advantage, memory, sight, an opportunity, a friend, &amp;c.<br/><br/>* You gain something traumatic.<br/><br/>A disease, a broken bone, a worse situation, an emotional trigger, a haunting memory &amp;c.<br/><br/>Oh, and for the recovery, you should always need someone's help.

A couple things, though:<br/><br/>1. If you take out the two "weak hit" choices, where is the room for the MC to be a fan of the PCs? I mean, the MC can choose "you lose a tactical advantage" instead of "your hand gets cut off," but by calling out those weak hit picks you remind the MC that they are there (although I'm not married to having two of them). Context counts here, of course, since we have severity gradients present in my list of choices, while that is left up to the MC in yours, but you know, a reminder is helpful sometimes? And then for serious wounds it's built in that the MC can't just pick the minor ones? 'Course that's still numbers but then again, I'm not against all numbers for this one (we still have stats after all).<br/><br/>2. Not really feeling "gain something traumatic." Of course you gain something traumatic, you get injured, adrenaline flows, memories etch in your brain. You need drugs to stop from being haunted just by suffering trauma to begin with. So that part I feel is sort-of automatic, I guess? The other exampes of this are also the same as other choices: a disease, worse sitch, triggers, are all on-going harm, right? Although you could differentiate between fast/short-term deterioration ("you have a wound, deal with it or die") and long-term marks and it would be similar.<br/><br/>Then again, I do sort-of like the "death spiral, flatline, -resource, +flaw" quintet you got going.<br/><br/>As to recovery requiring someone else: I agree in principle, and it needs no better reason than that it makes for a better game. But I am also very much enamoured of the exchange that goes: "MC: You are stunned, deaf, unable to make sense of your surroundings. Player: I snap out of it. MC: Roll to recover." That is a "short-term condition" though, and healing wounds or learning to cope with PTSD are recovering from "long-term conditions" so I can see the advantage of making that distinction and putting restrictions on the second.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400539/#Comment_400539" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T21:31:56+00:00" title="December 11, 2012  9:31PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2012 9:33PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daumantas,<br/><br/>I like and dislike things about this version:\n<blockquote>How's this?:<br/><br/>When you're hit by something that could kill you, roll +armour. On a 10+, you might get shaken up, but no lasting damage. On a 7-9, MC holds 1. On a miss, MC holds 2. If it's something you should definitelly not survive, double the hold. Spend your hold one-for-one to:<br/>* Have something bad go worse, or something worse go fucked<br/>* Cripple the body part exposed to danger<br/>* Stun one of their senses<br/>* Leave a lasting mark<br/>* Give them mystery pain<br/><br/>That seems short/evocative enough and about in line with how I've experienced pain and injuries to work on my own body.<br/></blockquote>\nIt seems incredibly generous to me. Like, if I have 2-armor and someone fires a freaking cannon at me I have a 42% chance of "no lasting damage"? And a decent chance of not just surviving but coming out unscathed even if someone shoots me with that cannon twice? And same goes if someone puts a gun to my ribs and says, "if you move, I'll pull the trigger"?<br/><br/>Second question: Does this mean it's not kosher for the MC to do those things when they don't have hold?<br/><br/>Like, if you get hit by an axe, I can't narrate that it makes a lasting mark unless I want to spend hold on it? Even if it totally makes sense? And we can't describe the character's pain unless it's well-defined or something?<br/><br/>What if the injury goes untreated, is the MC not allowed to "have something go worse" or "give them mystery pain" because that's cheating (effectively getting extra hold)?<br/><br/>I guess I'm having trouble seeing it in play. Tell me more!<br/><br/>Third question: does this mean that character death is just completely the MC's call?\n<blockquote>P.S. Something that can't possibly kill you is in the realm of regular MC move stuff, if you're wondering.</blockquote>\nThat's pretty awesome.

It's pretty slick. I'm a little worried that it might be a) too deadly on its own, and b) not deadly enough when armour is involved (which is one thing I tried to fix in my hack). (Ask me to elaborate if you don't know what I mean.) I also have no idea how it interfaces with existing AW rules (which was one of my criteria when I wrote my thing).<br/><br/>Some thoughts on recovery and help being needed:<br/><br/>How about building that into the move?<br/><br/>When you recover from trauma, roll. On a 10+, you recover quickly and as fully as is possible under the circumstances. On a 7-9, you recover but the MC chooses one:<br/>* it takes extra time and/or attention<br/>* it marks you in a permanent way<br/>* you can't recover on your own, you need help<br/>On a miss, you do not recover. If your circumstances change later (like if you get access to some help), you can roll again.<br/><br/>For what to roll, I like the idea of saying that you just roll (no stat base), but then you have two criteria listed. Each one, if fulfilled, gives you +1 to the roll. Adjust the conditions for the genre/ga,e in question.<br/><br/>It could even be context-dependent. For medical healing, for example, add 1 for each of the following:<br/>* You have access to the necessary equipment/facilities/supplies.<br/>* You have access to someone with the necessary expertise (this could be yourself)<br/><br/>So you end up rolling +0, +1, or +2.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400547/#Comment_400547" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T23:01:32+00:00" title="December 11, 2012 11:01PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            However, I'm still in love with the idea of a player choosing the harm effects.

Obviously each recover move should be tailored to its specific game, but that's objectively better than most of my interations.<br/><br/>One part of the stat confusion is that acting while stunned or coming out of unconsciusness is acting under fire, essentially, and roll+medical help to recover is basically the angel kit move, right? So you're basically re-writing that by dropping a recover move into AW.<br/><br/>So here's some amusing irony for you: I got turned off by the player choosing their harm effects in your moves, as a gut reaction, BUT in the draft of Black Seas I already wrote, when you take harm, you (the player) distribute the points between stress and injury tracks. So if you have enough empty stress boxes, you can dictate that you take no real injuries from full-auto gunfire. Although when you select injury, the MC chooses. So, I mean... take my resistance there with a grain of salt. If you put something into genre context, I can go from "Hate! Haaate!" to "Oh, then it works perfectly" at the drop of a hat.<br/><br/><b>Orly:</b> Aaaah, yeah... At first I'm concerned about smaller groups, and I think about action heroes getting back up again and then I go to genre and it's like: covert ops teamwork vs. those guys in Solaris are just absolutely fucked, and it makes sense.

So the MC can hit hard, the PC can fall down, and then if the player rolls good, the PC gets back up. A lot more uncertainty than knowing how many hit points you have left. As for armour, I'm not including how you can roll a full hit and then have it do nothing because armour reduces harm to zero. That's a case where I think DW gets it right: if you can't hurt them because of their robot suit, you're not really attacking them. Likewise, if you miss and the MC throws harm at you and your armour just soaks it up, it's not really a miss, is it?

On a 10+, you recover quickly and as fully as is possible under the circumstances. On a 7-9, you recover but the MC chooses one:<br/>* it takes extra time and/or attention<br/>* it marks you in a permanent way<br/>* not until you get some outside help<br/>* you find yourself in a tight spot or unpleasant situation<br/><br/>That last one is for flexibility. Like, "you wake up (much faster than anyone thought you would), but you're tied to a chair" but also, "You recover miraculously quickly, you're up and walking within a couple of months. As a result, the other patients are green with envy, and no one wants to talk to you anymore/people make the sign of the cross and mutter when you're nearby."<br/><br/>I also removed the "on a miss" clause, because why do we need it for this move? It's better to let the MC be able to choose "ok, you recover, but here's a hard move too" instead of always saying "you don't recover", I think.<br/><br/>Great point on the overlap with Angel moves and acting under fire. Let's think on it! (Unless you already have more than you're saying, then please share.)<br/><br/>Of course, this version of harm and recovery is getting awfully close to the workspace rules. I'm not sure if that's good or bad (I can see arguments for both).<br/><br/>On the player-chooses-harm thing, that's clearly just a preference thing. No reason the MC couldn't make all the choices. I just don't like doing that: I LOVE letting the player make the choices, I find it immersive, and it feels very appropriate to AW for me (making tough choices off a list).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400595/#Comment_400595" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-12T12:16:12+00:00" title="December 12, 2012 12:16PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the similarity to the workspace rules is intentional.

The harm move isn't really the PC doing something, it's just made to look like it. It's no different than the MC rolling for damage. By creating guidelines for the MC, it also mimics how you can't use hard moves until a miss or an opportunity. And then the player rolls when they do something about their situation, just like the basic moves.<br/><br/>I don't think I have anything more for dropping stuff into AW proper, no.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400608/#Comment_400608" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-12T13:17:25+00:00" title="December 12, 2012  1:17PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, here's about how I'm imagining the whole harm deal to go:<br/><br/>You get harmed, the MC takes note of it in a vague sense - you have bruises, your leg refuses to work momentarily, a disease you caught earlier begins manifesting, etcetera etcetera. Cosmetic harm, momentary disadvantages, pushing on stuff that they ignore. Standard moves &amp; snowballing - the kind of stuff I believe we all already do in addition the default AW harm rules.<br/><br/>Now, if you get into a serious fight, all of the above stuff still holds, but there's an added risk of immediate grevious bodily harm - both new shit going down and previously cosmetic stuff becoming damned serious.<br/><br/>For me, it's less about the moment-to-moment effects that a character suffers and more about turning the PC's body into a kind of multifaceted Front.

MC says nahh, it took too much out of you, you black out momentarily, you're now _down_.<br/><br/>In Johnstone's harm post above there is a specific death spiral of bloodied-&gt;bleeding-&gt;incapacitated. By just having a set of tags and consequences the order can be mixed n matched to match the fiction and the set of effects/consequences is limited only by the imaginations at the table (but you'd still have a standard set). We had a fantastic Ghost/Echo game where on player was "dying" from early on. Every time he made a roll from that point on, death was on the line.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400646/#Comment_400646" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T01:02:59+00:00" title="December 13, 2012  1:02AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, you can mix and match the stuff in my harm move, there's no specific order, though you still get a couple chances to be saved if the MC picks all the bad ones.

(Obviously, they do and will, as you can see from my harm hack.)<br/><br/>The part that's difficult is that the MC can no longer disclaim responsibility over a character's death, as s/he can in standard AW as well as in my hack. <br/><br/>As an AW MC, I don't want to choose between hosing the characters and letting them off too easy. For instance, when someone's bleeding real bad, do I just make the faint and miss a move, or do I say they're dead now? It's all up to me. And removing someone's character from play, I feel, is a pretty major thing in this game, one I'd like more than one person at the table to have some say in.<br/><br/>Same goes for accumulating wounds. What happens if a monster is chewing on a guy's leg, or someone is getting repeatedly punched in the face? How do you make the call for when it becomes more serious, when it ends the character's life?<br/><br/>Your list of effects for each level of harm certainly helps with that! But we're also removing the slight plot immunity/protection AW normally grants characters if we make injuries too realistic, I feel. This is a personal preference, granted, not some kind of statement on game design.<br/><br/>I'm still really in love with letting the players choose the level and expression of harm for these situations, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400703/#Comment_400703" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T14:14:16+00:00" title="December 13, 2012  2:14PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2012 7:27AM by Colinaut.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All prior jokes aside, I really like the body as multifaceted front concept and for the most part that is what most everyone is talking about. Whether you follow <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T%27s">@Paul_T's</a> and let the player decide their harm or let the MC decide, these are essentially descriptive harm threat tags being placed on the character. And taking this that one step further and placing the threat tags on index cards a la Ghost/Echo is great!<br/><br/>Looking at harm like a Front, even if the MC decides all the harm effects, the responsibility for character death is really still in the player's hands as long as you follow the MC moves. Applying harm effects then becomes a series of soft moves and hard moves. Basically it's a lot of "Tell them the possible consequences and ask", "Offer opportunity with cost" and "Take away their stuff" moves. If they press on then you as an MC have every right to make it worse by the move of "Activate their stuff's (harm effect's) downside". For instance\u2026<br/><i>"The gunshot rips through your leg muscle. You're not moving very quickly any more which makes you an easy target if you give them a chance to shoot at you again. What do you do?"</i><br/>or\u2026 <i>"The harpoon punctures your abdomen. You can keep fighting but every move you make risks doing more damage. You can try ripping it out but that might be more dangerous. What do you do?"</i><br/><br/>For serious harm it's not really much different except you may want to do your soft move before any shots are fired\u2026<br/><i>"You've got 5 machine guns trained on you. Do you really want to charge in and take them on? Even if you succeed you are likely to take some heavy damage. So what do you do?"</i><br/><br/>Serious harm can lead to another "offer opportunity" move\u2026<br/><i>"You managed to take out three guys and the others aren't doing well, but you took a few bullets yourself. You are loosing blood fast. You can try and take the last guys out but if you fail that next bullet is your last and even if you succeed you'll likely pass out and possibly bleed to death with no one around to save you. Or you can save your strength, let them capture you and pray that they won't just kill you out right.

In the last example above, the MC was giving a choice\u2026 If they try and take them out and fail they are dead (NO SAVING THROW). If they succeed they won't die right away but it leads to a lot of interesting story ideas like <i>"You pass out and then some time later wake up in bandages and strapped to a bed. An old crone you've never seen before is staring at you with her one good eye and holding an uzi. What do you do?"</i> <br/><br/>If they decide to drop and save their strength the next action is of course\u2026 <i>"The two remaining guys immediately jump to cover you. One steps on you shoving you in the dirt, grinding their boot heel into the fresh wound. The other points his rifle at your head and says 'Tell me why we shouldn't kill you now?' What do you do?"</i><br/><br/>Both of the above situations lead to more moves with interesting choices. As the situation becomes more dangerous, some choices will be you can do that but you should be explicit that if they fail their roll they will die\x7f\u2014ideally this hard death move is linked with a move roll of some sort\u2014or they can do this other thing which will place their character in an even worse bad situation. Also, sometimes you can put this choice in the hands of other PCs\u2026 <i>"Bangs drops under the hail of bullets and is bleeding out. It's obvious that if you don't try and rescue her she will die as these goons aren't taking prisoners. What do you do?"</i> and if they other PCs leave the player there they are dead because again that's what you stated would happen.<br/><br/><b><i>On Edit Addendum:</i></b> Really my suggestions above are basically exactly what a MC does anyway. It just removes the Harm Clock and replaces it with a narrative hammer that explicitly tells the player what kinda damage it'll do if they don't figure out a way to avoid the worst of the blow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400718/#Comment_400718" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T15:56:07+00:00" title="December 13, 2012  3:56PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, mans. <br/><br/>Making AW seems real basically means not making it into an action movie for me. <br/><br/>If there are guns involved the people die real easy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400720/#Comment_400720" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T16:02:29+00:00" title="December 13, 2012  4:02PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2012 4:46PM by Colinaut.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oh, mans. <br/><br/>Making AW seems real basically means not making it into an action movie for me. <br/><br/>If there are guns involved the people die real easy.</blockquote>\nWhat do you do with a Gunlugger than, as running into a gunfight is kinda their MO?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400724/#Comment_400724" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T16:41:09+00:00" title="December 13, 2012  4:41PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2012 4:42PM by Johnstone.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, this is why preference actually is a matter of game design -- because you're modelling a conceptual situation, either your personal experience with something, a genre portrayal, nonfiction data, or someone else's explanation.

He's on the hilltop with the sniper-rifle, or like sneaking around with a big ass knife taking out the snipers. He knows how to make his shots count, check corners and take cover. But just cause you're <i>not to be fucked with</i>, doesn't make you suddenly bulletproof, Kevlar vest or no. <br/><br/>Also, note I said <i>people</i> and not <i>the player characters</i>. The PCs have five fucking harm ticks. That's at least two shotgun blasts plus reliable healing either with barter or an Angel. I can't really kill the PCs out-right with guns even if I wanted to. Even if they get into stupid gun fights. And guns, fuck, <i>knives</i> kill people stupidly easily. So easily that experts do it accidentally all the time. I wouldn't sell a child a gun that can't kill someone in one shot, no problem. Which means NPCs are soon to be buried with a Gunlugger around.<br/><br/>So, like, I'm not gonna be like SNIPER IN THAT DERELICT BUILDING YER DEAD! HA! That's reality but that's boring. However, if someone takes a non-grazing bullet-wound, or has a sucking abdominal chest wound, because of a goddamn harpoon, and that's just the kind of thing that happens in gun battles, it's not a choice to keep fighting. No, your choice at that point is to try to cling to life. Can you hold it together long enough to pour blood-thickener on the wound and seal it or can you even open your belt-pouch with all this blood everywhere?<br/><br/>But that's me being raised on the knee of a firefighter: my childhood involves actual accounts of multiple death car crashes with dental retainers impacting the into the backs of skulls and sober instructions on how to break someones ribs performing CPR as to give them two more minutes of life.<br/><br/>If you want something a little more dramatic, then your interpretations of the MC rules are necessarily going to be different. Not wrong though! Just different aesthetic and narrative priorities.<br/><br/>To answer your question as to what do I do with a Gunlugger: I show them how terribly fragile human life is. Not their life. They're the hard-ass with the big guns. No, everyone else's.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400744/#Comment_400744" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T19:54:37+00:00" title="December 13, 2012  7:54PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Orly,<br/><br/>Aren't we just talking about player characters here?

Make its outcomes mostly sudden and aleatory but sometimes slow and deliberate. Make defense and healing scarce. <br/><br/>I talk about details both psychological and physiological. I try to describe arteries, bones, organs and fear, hesitation and terror. I try and find things that I know my players care about and make those things difficult and vulnerable, so when they fight for them it's bittersweet and worthwhile. But heartwrenching too.<br/><br/>That's all abstract tho. <br/><br/>I don't think in all the AW I've run I've ever had someone play a Gunlugger. There was a Chopper once. I made him name everyone in his gang, give them a little life. Naturally, that pack of fucking hyenas would get into scrapes and battles, so I'd talk about how they'd die. Like, when his gang soaked harm, I'd make him cross names off. And when he had to make examples too. I'd ask about what he did with the stinking and stiffening bodies of his pack-mates. I'd talk about getting pinned under his bike, the engine so hot that it burned through the layers of skin, so that after awhile it didn't hurt at all because the nerve-endings had been seared. By the end of the first session, half of his pack was dead or crippled. <br/><br/>Also, I've had the good fortune of playing with people happy to describe their own traumas honestly and harshly so as often as not I can disclaim that stuff to them. Make the outcomes of moves a group discussion.<br/><br/>IIRC, I hit that same Chopper with some serious shit for trying to siege a hardhold and he was like "Nope, I'm fucking dog-meat. Hand me the stack of playbooks."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager"

You make the PCs seem inhuman in their mechanically backed, genre supported armor. Their life isn't fragile because their the reaping whirlwind blowing through everyone else's.

I usually try and think about how to make the situation worse, skip sometime or cut to the next significant scene. It's a trick I learned from Vincent and John. Like, if a fight is going really badly for the PCs, instead of trying to kill them or something, you say: "...three days later you wake up chained in the slave-pits.

It would be really interesting to just all get together and play. It would clear up a lot!<br/><br/>Orly, here's what I was asking you about:\n<blockquote>Making AW seems real basically means not making it into an action movie for me. <br/><br/>If there are guns involved the people die real easy. [...] I mean, what kind of idiot just runs into firing arcs?<br/></blockquote>\nOk, I follow that. That's my vision of Apocalypse World, too.<br/><br/>But then:\n<blockquote><br/>Also, note I said <i>people</i> and not <i>the player characters</i>. The PCs have five fucking harm ticks. That's at least two shotgun blasts plus reliable healing either with barter or an Angel. I can't really kill the PCs out-right with guns even if I wanted to. <br/>[...]<br/>However, if someone takes a non-grazing bullet-wound, or has a sucking abdominal chest wound, because of a goddamn harpoon, and that's just the kind of thing that happens in gun battles, it's not a choice to keep fighting. No, your choice at that point is to try to cling to life. Can you hold it together long enough to pour blood-thickener on the wound and seal it or can you even open your belt-pouch with all this blood everywhere?<br/></blockquote>\nFrom this, I can't really figure out how you're suggesting PCs should be handled. How do you decide when a PC is dead? How do you decide when a PC is hurt and dying, and will expire without help?<br/><br/>In standard AW, PC death is not an MC choice, period. (You can always take a debility and survive.) I like that effect: it turns death into yet another, "Oh, yeah? How about now? How about now?" choice. It asks, "Is it still worth it for you to keep playing your character even when they...?"<br/><br/>I really like that effect, which is why I kept it in my hack (one of the design goals was to stay as close as possible to standard AW rules).<br/><br/>In short, I'm confused how your "AW is deadly, and people die easily" squares with your statement that the PCs lives are not yours to take even if you wanted to.<br/><br/>(Your comment about making a different harm move - essentially my entry for "you recover, but you find yourself in a tight spot" in the last iteration of Johnstone's "recovery" move - does a lot to answer this question already, but is that the entirety of it? Because that DOES sound very much like an action movie, which you said you don't see AW being very similar to.)<br/><br/>So, basically, I just want to hear more about how you play AW!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400822/#Comment_400822" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T10:42:17+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 10:42AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2012 10:43AM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, again people =! PCs. I kill NPCs all the time, quickly or slowly. Important, unimportant. <br/><br/>But actual PC death? I think of it asymptotically. As an MC I escalate towards it constantly, but I can't ever do it unilaterally. Either the mechanics or the PC do it but I never say "you die." And in practice, I don't ever need to. When a PC is bleeding out, the other PCs aren't dicking around. They are trying desperately to keep everyone alive. <br/><br/>Like, so a PC takes a bullet wound to the chest (2-harm +bleeding-out, 2/6 harm) and is fumbling with the bloodthickener and misses, I say "Okay, mark off the bloodthickener and mark 1-harm (3/6 harm) from blood lost." <i>Inflict harm as established</i>. Without fail that makes the other PCs be all like "OH SHIT IRIS IS DYING WE GOTTA SAVE HER". Sure, Iris is 'only' at 3 harm segments but if no one does anything she's toast. That's <i>telling consequences and asking</i>. I mean, yeah, if they're like "Fuck Iris. We leave her to bleed-out." Iris would either decide to die or mark a debility and crawl back to vengeance. It's out of my hands tho. That's <i>disclaiming</i>. I can, if I want, introduce new fiction to save Iris' bacon. It depends how deus ex I'm feeling and what my fronts are like. <br/><br/>Anyways, the hacks I'm working on strip out a lot the PC invulnerability and control. My problem with the harm-metre and x-harm isn't that it doesn't work, it's that the fiction is glossed over too often in practice. The same problem you seem to have had. I suspect it's a strange kind of D&amp;D brain-damage via HP. <br/><br/>Like, you don't really even need a harm-move. Look at my example. Guns inflict gun wounds. Bleeding gets worse undo death. Something needs to happen about that or you die. Just follow the fiction and stay close to the players.<br/><br/>I'm always, always soliciting feedback during game about what's happening. "Hey, so Iris is dying. How to you feel about that? Those fuckers just left you there, so do you want me to make with the deus ex machina so you can go get them?" <br/><br/>It's not just about my vision of the game but everyone who's at the table. When I'm a PC vs GM/MC I grind the shit out of my characters. Sometimes, I can see the GM squirming. So, I say "I'm okay with dying here, you know. I know that's on the menu."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400823/#Comment_400823" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T10:44:19+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 10:44AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            UPDATE:<br/><br/>Although this conversation is certainly not over (at least not for me), I'll update the original link with the latest version (just some minor changes).<br/><br/><a href="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/62049233/Apocalypse%20harm%20v3.pdf" rel="nofollow">Latest Version</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400827/#Comment_400827" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T10:55:41+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 10:55AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Orly,<br/><br/>That's some awesome advice on running AW, all good stuff.<br/><br/>And you're right that a harm move or harm rules are not necessarily a must.<br/><br/>But there's a reason to have them, too, and it's for people who don't want to handle character death (or things like debilities) on a purely social level. <br/><br/>Let's say you have a character who's trapped in a building when it gets bombed or blown up, but he's running for the basement or crouching in some kind of hole or something.<br/><br/>Sometimes the players will be cool with saying, "Yeah, he's dead." Or maybe, "Okay, let's roll for it!"<br/><br/>But when the player is clearly invested in this character's story and doesn't want them to die, what does the MC do? You say, on one hand, that you want to "strip out a lot of the invlunerability and control" for PCs, but then you also say (or at least imply) that you would never kill a PC without the player's consent. Isn't that "invulnerability and control", by definition?<br/><br/>So the rules allow us to have the risk of death (or debilities or whatever) without having to negotiate it all the time (maybe not a big deal for someone like you, who doesn't mind having their character die, but a major sticking point for a LOT of gamers).<br/><br/>This becomes even more important when we're dealing with PC-against-PC violence. No MC tools (like "just make a different hard move") are going to resolve that issue very smoothly, you either need a set of rules or you need to come to consensus at the table, which some people love and some people consider problematic.<br/><br/>(On a sidenote, the problem with hit points is not just D&amp;D brain damage. The rules are pretty clear: harm before 9:00 doesn't get worse on its own. If an MC plays the move you suggest in your post -- if you don't stop the bleeding from 2-harm, you'll take more harm -- a player is fairly justified in saying you're playing against the rules. <br/><br/>This kind of thing, in turn, suggests that AW hit points are like D&amp;D hit points: they have as much to do with luck and script immunity as they have with any kind of actual correspondence to real physical damage to the character. It's also clear in the way the sickly weakling Brainer with -2 Hard--or whatever--gets six segments of harm, just like the Gunlugger or anyone else who is supposed to be badass.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400828/#Comment_400828" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T10:56:19+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 10:56AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2012 11:10AM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            XPOST <br/><br/>So, a couple of things:<br/><br/>1) You're right about the Harm rules. So, that's me making custom moves (Serious usually wounds always get worse, usually quickly.) There's this tension in AW, where Vincent has these examples where people putting pistols in people's faces but they can pretty much just walk that shit off by the rules. <br/><br/>2) Yeah, so with the consent thing. The MCs principles are the rules too. And also, that consent is like metathing I bring to all games. I always need consent, all the time, in everything I do with other human beings. Otherwise I'm a petty fascist. The text of a game isn't something I use to coerce people into indulging my own vision and control. <i>However</i>, it does heavily establish the grounds and expectations of people playing the game.<br/><br/>A game does needs rules and guidelines for that sort of thing. I agree with you there. <br/><br/>3) So, people being precious with their characters. Not really interested in it nor do I care to design for them. Like with sex and sexuality in AW and MH, if that's a deal-breaker for someone, then don't play the game. <br/><br/>4)For me this how I'd write that harm move:<br/><br/>When you get beaten up or grazed by something, the MC'll pick one from the pain list.<br/><br/>When you're hit by something that could kill you, the MC'll pick one from the serious shit list.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400831/#Comment_400831" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T11:03:29+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 11:03AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could go for that.

It is in fact 'plot armour', or, in other words, the ability of the character to do things despite being resisted. So what's really happening when a character gets hurt is that he's getting deprotagonised. The more you get hurt, the less you're able to do things despite other people.<br/><br/>And the thing about that is that there's meaningful deprotagonisation and not. I suspect that this means that flat out more descriptive harm ("you lose your leg and can't move much anymore") isn't necessarily going to provide us with what we really(?) want, which is a kind of meaningful narrowing of options ("Chopper, you lose your leg and can't move much except when strapped into the bike by your lads.")<br/><br/><br/>More on topic - and I feel this has something to do with the above - I *would* kill a PC without his consent, if it had come to it and that would be the most interesting thing to do.<br/><br/>Most of the time that'll mean that I do in fact have the player's consent, but it's not like that's a must. As MC, I am a fan of the character, not the player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400846/#Comment_400846" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T12:26:11+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 12:26PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shit man, if you're not a fan of the player then why are you at the same table?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400853/#Comment_400853" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T13:12:39+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  1:12PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm friends with people I play chess or boardgames with, but them being friends doesn't directly factor into the game played, right?<br/><br/>A different way of saying the same thing is that a player can grant me consent for his PC's death far earlier than at the time of the actual death.<br/><br/>I have killed a PC once - Truth, a Hocus. She had the Angel's lay on hands move, and we've established that, in that particular game at least, misses mean 1-harm for the person being healed, and that healing yourself iz a double-whammy of the same. The player had made the move multiple times with the same risk, hitting it most times. Then, one time, Truth was hiding in the subway tunnels after an attack by an car and was pretty near death, tried to heal herself, and missed the roll.<br/><br/>That meant the death of Truth. And I think that's fine.<br/><br/>She went on to psychically possess a member of her cult, whereas her ever-healing, ever-bleeding body was put up as a kind of symbol in the streets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400854/#Comment_400854" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T13:15:51+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  1:15PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2012 1:22PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, man. Well, this threatens to explode and destroy this thread, so let's be careful (or start a new one), but in my mind there are different levels of consent.<br/><br/>Like, there's the kind of consent where you say, "Dude, I don't like that. I'm not playing this game anymore."<br/><br/>But there's also the kind of consent where you don't want something but you've agreed to give someone else authority to enforce it. Maybe I don't want my character to get turned on by that jerk in the Monsterhearts game, but I've agreed to play a game where I'm not allowed to just say, "No, that doesn't happen."<br/><br/>I feel that the way death is handled in a looser version of harm rules (like Orly suggests) can take us from the latter to the former.<br/><br/>So, there's requiring player consent in a larger sense (which applies to all roleplaying, because it's basically imaginary), and there's requiring player consent within the frame of agreed-upon rules. If you're MCing Apocalypse World and you say, "This big biker walks into the bar," I don't get to say, "No. That doesn't happen." Not as long as we're still playing by the rules we agreed upon.<br/><br/>(On a sidenote: I'm not concerned about the Czege principle, because that's the whole point of AW-style lists. You narrow the choices to the interesting ones, and once you've done so you can put those choices back into the hands of the players and the game still works. It's the premise behind Otherkind dice, and most AW moves. I have faith that it works!)<br/><br/>Orly,<br/><br/>I'm confused about your statement about "people being precious with their characters". Yes, this can go bad and ruin the game. I like to have my character suffer and all that! But, beyond that, advocating for your character is your job in a game like AW.<br/><br/>The MC says, "there's bullets flying at you, if you stand still, you're going to die!" It's now my job to figure how I can deal with that situation. If I respond with, "I don't care, my character's dead. I win!" Well, the game won't work. <br/><br/>So, I think we can have plenty of situations where the player doesn't want their character to die but isn't "being precious" to the detriment of the game. And that's where I'm not sure what the MC should do in a more freeform situation: "be a fan of the characters" and "keep Apocalypse World real" start to conflict at a certain point.<br/><br/>It sounds like your solution is always to let the character survive in those situations, and find a way to make it make sense in the fiction later (e.g. "you wake up tied to a chair..."). Does that sound about right?<br/><br/>You also make a really great point, and one that lots of us forget all the time:<br/><br/>95% of these situations can be solved just by having a brief out-of-game conversation about it. Ask the player! Talk about it.<br/><br/>That's a great take-away from this whole conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400856/#Comment_400856" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T13:21:06+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  1:21PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daumantas,<br/><br/>How did Truth's death work in game terms?

The player got to define what Jav's memories were, with the implicit limitation that it would be in line with what had been established about Jav before, which was something but not much.<br/><br/>Truthjav was a lot more confused about spirituality than Truth was, and became far more likely to use his/her knife and approach problems pragmatically.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, we probably don't really disagree on how player consent works in the game, exact phrasing and details aside (or if we do, I'd rather not discuss it on this thread.

That's me tho.)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> : Being precious is different from advocating or being a fan. Being precious in a game like Clover is totally rad. Being precious in a game like AW is like, maybe you should write some fanfic instead. Being precious with the protags an ultracommon thing popular narrative. We're precious with Shepard. I'm not sure that's an entirely good thing. <br/><br/>Like, what if Shepard can die at any point in the trilogy but you can just keep playing without them? What doesn't that mean for the narrative and for the game design? What if Liara saves the world? What if the only character continuity is the Normandy? <br/><br/>Wanting to survive isn't being precious. Wanting only good things to happen to the character just because it's yours and despite its inconsistency within established fiction is being precious. <br/><br/>Oh, and about always surviving: Sorta. Death is usually the least interesting option in a lot of situations.

(Although Orly was the first one to mention the idea of needing help.)<br/><br/>Then again, you could mean something different. (Like needing help just to roll the recover move, or that when you get help you recover automatically.)<br/><br/>And now, since this thread is turning into a sort of compilation of AW and AW hack harm rules, here's one more, from a G+ conversation originated by <a href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">@John_Harper</a>, modified by me:<br/><br/>It's intended for Dungeon World or some other similar game, but it could work in AW, unmodified, as well! Your countdown clock then is not for how close you are to death, but how close you are to having no more plot immunity.\n<blockquote><br/><b><i>When you resist harm</i></b>, the MC will tell you what injury threatens your life. Roll+number of hit points you'd like to spend. One a hit, choose options. On a 13+, all of them. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1.<br/>* You can ignore this injury for now, it doesn't hamper you<br/>* You got lucky: the injury's not as big a deal as it seemed<br/>* You maintain your position or advantage, and can react immediately (maybe even take +1forward)<br/>On a miss, you suffer the injury in full, right now.<br/></blockquote>\nWhen Frodo gets "run through" by the troll in the Mines of Moria, but we later find out that he had a mithril shirt on and he's actually totally fine, that means he rolled 7-9 and chose "you got lucky" (but loses his position, can't react, and is seriously affected by the blow). <br/><br/>I think I'll be using this if I ever play D&amp;D or some variation thereof.<br/><br/>EDIT: Why do I think it's cool? First, it makes the true purpose of hit points instantly clear. Second, it allows you to customize how much you want to gamble your character's life. (Spend 5 hit points per hit, and you're guaranteed to survive.) Third, it allows the MC to make the threat very real -- "The orc is gonna chop off your arm!" -- instead of it being a generic number (take 6 damage). Finally, it means the MC no longer has to decide between inflicting harm and making a move of some other sort. The MC just says what bad thing is happening, you lose some hit points (unless you choose to roll+0), and we snowball from there. Finally, it still feels relatively familiar to D&amp;D nostalgia enthusiasts: you have hit points, they go down in a fight even if you're winning.<br/><br/>FURTHER EDIT: Finally, it forces the MC to describe the wounds in detail, or you don't know how many hit points you want to spend.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400874/#Comment_400874" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T14:26:03+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  2:26PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's definitelly a part of it.

Prior it felt too much like an automatic recover roll rather than a roll that is triggered by the narrative fiction.

Characters can do anything but what they actual fixate on are basic moves. Sex, manipulation, and violence. You see it with all the problems in DW. Sage and Adam's answers are great (e.g. the 16HP Dragon and the limits on H&amp;S). I'd rather just make those things explicit in the rules. <br/><br/>So, to recover to just need to address that shit in fiction, then you end up with weak equivocation to get the effects. Which even I'm guilty of doing in games. <br/><br/>If instead you say something, like "to recover from a minor trauma, you need to be explicitly vulnerable to another character, at least for a moment.

Which even I'm guilty of doing in games. <br/><br/>If instead you say something, like "to recover from a minor trauma, you need to be explicitly vulnerable to another character, at least for a moment. To recover from a major trauma, you'll need a whole scene with another PC where you're completely vulnerable. When you recover from a major trauma..." then you set the minium in terms of what is needed to trigger the move.</blockquote>\nIt's a good point, but it doesn't feel overly AW to me. Most of the time I find if people are glossing over the fiction to get the mechanical result, it's because it's not interesting to the people playing, so you either accept that and move onto the next interesting thing or add something to make it interesting. Is being vulnerable to others interesting? I guess so, but it's not the only interesting thing that could result from needing to patch a wound. <br/><br/>Now fair enough call to add in this prerequisite for healing if AW is thematically all about how you have to rely on one another to survive, but it's not, at least the way I read the text. A lot of the playbooks are loners, and if you want to be, you can stay a loner, no problem.<br/><br/>I think scarcity probably fits AW better - so you need well-stocked supplies, a place to hole up, an Angel you really trust or you're fucked... and maybe that's where you end up vulnerable to others, getting caught by the gang boss, patched up and pressganged into the militia or whatever.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401055/#Comment_401055" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T07:19:16+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  7:19AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2012 7:54AM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's not AW.

It's about community the way Star Wars is about coming of age.<br/><br/>It's about the problems a community - you don't have stuff you need to really be a person, and most people around you are complete assholes. So saying fuck-you to the community or members of it, and then burning them down and riding off to the sunset should always remain an open option. It might not be a good game when that happens, but the game overall is better for that option being there. What would Star Wars be without the possibility that Luke actually turns to the Dark Side?<br/><br/>You can't beat the theme over people's heads, right?<br/><br/>So the *rule* to have to have a vulnerable moment with another character is a bad idea. First, I seriously doubt explicitly writing down that rule for a player's character to follow will lead to anything that will make the player meaningfully experience vulnerability.<br/><br/>Something that guides play towards the same but doesn't explicitly state it would be better. Frex, something like this for workspace-like healing moves:<br/><br/>(1-2 on the harm clock) Simple knocks and bruises will heal by themselves so long you eat and sleep well enough.<br/>(3-5 on the harm clock) More serious shit will take two of three - good time, a safe place, and active care.<br/>(6 on the harm clock) Whatever happened to you, the results are irreversible. You can't heal, but the MC might tell you how you can cope.<br/><br/>So you can still have stuff like a bleeding Gunlugger crawling into a cement pipe, snaping his bones back in place and pulling the bullet out of his shoulder, then passing out for a week. Or a savvyhead that has a machine that patches him up with parts stolen from other people. Maybe the Battlebabe killed a bunch of scavengers in their campsite, got a minor bruise for it, and is now sleeping it off. But is he sleeping well? Whatever the answer, we get an interesting result.<br/><br/>All these people are clearly not community persons. But they have to go seriously out of their way to be able to avoid or ignore the community, and that's still an interesting statement.<br/><br/>So long as it's not a straightforward thing to do and the cost that needs to be paid makes sense, ignoring other people should still be an option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401090/#Comment_401090" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T13:24:43+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  1:24PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2012 1:24PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm picking up what you're putting down. My suggestion was meant as merely illustrative and off the top of my head. <br/><br/>Also, I think this might make reading my posts a little clearer: I'm not usually suggesting things that would work for an orthodox game of AW. I've been playing that game for over three years now, since the closed beta testing, and it does somethings extremely well but aren't really to my tastes or priorities. And I say that as a practically drooling fanboy of Vincent's work. <br/><br/>Having finally played Rock of Tahamaat, I actually vastly prefer it to AW or IAWA.\n<blockquote>AW's not about community, though.<br/><br/>It's not about community the way Star Wars is about spaceship battles.

That list of options puts them in a really hard spot tho. And without the move, they're shit out of luck (pp.172-175). <br/><br/>And I guess we'll have to disagree about what counts as an interesting statement. I've seen it in games and, IMHO, it's as dull as a bag of wet mice.

You can kind of tell what players are going for when they make those harm choices, even though the system still feels very dangerous and real.<br/><br/>We had a bit of a fight, with a grenade going off in the middle of a (small) crowd at the end. There were two PCs involved: the Battlebabe (a sexy, impulsive drug addict) and the Gunlugger (a tough dude who sticks to his guns). They both took a fair bit of damage, but the Battlebabe, due to her <i>Impossible Reflexes</i>, mostly suffered <i>pain</i> instead serious harm.<br/><br/>The Battlebabe ended up on the floor, her weapons knocked out of her grasp, and her enemies getting away--and, since she chose "you lost track of something important", she has no idea what the hell happened to them or where they went. I can see what this player wants: to get into deep shit and try to dig her way out of it. However, her health and image (as a total sexpot) are very important to her.<br/><br/>The Gunglugger, though, is all about taking a beating. He chose "You're a mess", having his nose broken, and ended the fight lying unconscious, crumpled into the wall ("out of action"). He's all about "how much do you have to hurt me to stop me kicking your ass?"<br/><br/>This is cool, because the two characters have exactly the same stats on paper (same armor, same potential to die or survive, no special harm-relevant moves), but the harm choices give a lot room to character expression.<br/><br/>The "serious shit" options also present an interesting trade-off: you can choose things which screw with you now (like falling unconscious), or things which harm you long-term (like losing the use of a limb, or a complicated wound which will only get worse), depending on whether it's more important to you to win the fight or to come out of to see another day.<br/><br/>At the same time, it feels very unforgiving: these are tough choices to make. No one wants to get shot under these rules! (Whereas with six segments of harm, you pretty much know you can take a bullet and not worry about it at all.)<br/><br/>So far I really like how this feels in play.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div

Would it be better to instead ask whether the character has sufficient armour for the situation. Then depending on they have a leather jacket in a knife fight or a bullet proof vest in a gun battle, you reduce the damage appropriately.<br/><br/>2) I wonder whether part of the problem with harm clocks is that, to adopt Vincent's terminology, we tend to treat that not as "descriptive and prescriptive" but as merely prescriptive. That's to say that, the tendency is tally up shots as they come in, but not to jump the clock ahead when the damage a character takes involves them starting to bleed out. <br/><br/>Do those observations make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402179/#Comment_402179" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-30T12:59:20+00:00" title="December 30, 2012 12:59PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 30, 2012 1:00PM by Johnstone.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, for 1), I think it would push the fiction more to the front if you're thinking in terms of a "no armour / armour mitigates harm / armour completely deflects attacks" breakdown, with the DW approach that you don't roll until you have a legitimate chance of inflicting harm (for the robot suits and LA bank robber armours that would just reduce your harm inflicted to zero, even on a 10+). Then you have to consider the fiction more than if you're just comparing "handgun does 2-harm, vest has 1-armour." Instead you think "I need a head shot," or "I need grenades," because "his vest will stop a bullet" and you describe fiction to go with that.<br/><br/>For 2), I dunno how it is for other people, but in play I always see harm and injuries get translated into x-harm before being applied to a character. So, instead of "you're bleeding out, that puts you at 9 o'clock" (which would skip over the "one free shot" that Vincent's added for cinematic reasons), but it's "you get shot, take x-harm" and if you wind up at 9 o'clock you might be bleeding (ie "it gets worse over time"). And that's definitely a result of it being "hit points."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402201/#Comment_402201" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-30T20:30:08+00:00" title="December 30, 2012  8:30PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 30, 2012 11:06PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Piers,<br/><br/>1) The armor thing, though, allows you to make those calls very easily and simply. How much can a leather vest stop a knife? I don't know. Making it a +1 to the roll means we can find out, instead. Same goes for moves which are difficult to handle descriptively (like Daredevil and Impossible Reflexes).<br/><br/>Note, though, that armour on NPCs works exactly as you've described under this system. It's just PCs who deal with armor numbers.<br/><br/>For various hacks in general, I like the idea of applying armour as a three-tiered thing: "it doesn't do anything, it helps mitigated damage, it blocks the attack entirely". <br/><br/>2) I like that approach, too. I had the same thought on page 3 of this conversation:\n<blockquote><br/>Another thought is just using the countdown clock more like the other clocks work.<br/><br/>You advance them when nasty stuff happens to the character (e.g. you get beat up). If something really bad happens, you advance it to 9:00 immediately. From then on, bad stuff happens to you until you deal with it.<br/><br/>So, taking a gunshot after you're at 9:00 means "that's only two more chances you have to get to some help, instead of three", as opposed to counting harm and the whole deal.<br/><br/>Now the clock is measuring how many story "beats" your character is away from death, instead of tracking weapon damage and armor.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is probably the easiest, cleanest, lightest hack of the Apocalypse World harm rules.<br/><br/>(I'm really enjoying the rules in this hack as written so far, however.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402235/#Comment_402235" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-31T00:20:01+00:00" title="December 31, 2012 12:20AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you end up using the latest list of pain choices, i.e. with the' you're dazed and black out', or the earlier list?<br/><br/>My groups taken a bit of a Christmas/New Year hiatus, so not had a chance to try it out yet, but sounds pretty cool from your description.

Some people like vague prompts; others do better with a list of concrete options.<br/><br/>Another thing this makes me think of: with AW-style lists, sometimes "paring down" by combining results is helpful, but sometimes I have a feeling that, while it looks good on paper, it actually makes it harder to parse in play.<br/><br/>For instance, you could have an option like:<br/><br/>* You lose something: a limb, your position, your footing, the moment, your awareness<br/><br/>It's a borderline-ridiculous example, but it illustrates what I'm trying to say. It makes the list clean and simple, but when you're actually playing, you have to choose that option and THEN go through a whole other step of figuring what it actually means.<br/><br/>I like how Vincent's original list is all very concrete:<br/><br/>* You lose your footing<br/>* You lose your grip on whatever you're holding<br/>* You lose track of something you're attending to<br/>* You miss noticing something important<br/><br/>All of those could be covered by the first, single-line entry I wrote.

So having a roll that says "there is no damage done" means you just made two rolls without any effect on the fiction at all.<br/><br/>That said, here are two easy solutions:<br/><br/>1. Add some other options to one or both lists. "Pain" could include things like "a few bruises", "scratched up", or even "clothes torn". The players can then choose those options (effectively not suffering any harm) the first time they get hit.<br/><br/>2. Include some kind of "hit points", as I suggest in the post above. These can be spent, each one giving a +1 on a harm roll. They shouldn't be too easy to replenish, however, or your game turns into D&amp;D. (Maybe one per session could work.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fealoro" title="fealoro"><img alt="fealoro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fealoro">fealoro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405680/#Comment_405680" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-07T14:17:52+00:00" title="February  7, 2013  2:17PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many thanks Paul.

It's quite similar to Technoir's adjective-based hurt, so it's been a pretty smooth transition. It certainly seem to keep the focus on the fiction. The players certainly engaged with their injuries in a different way compared with other AW sessions that used the standard countdown-style harm. I may still fiddle with the pain and serious shit list, but I'll play a bit more with it before making any tweaks. Otherwise, very cool. For example, on his harm roll from the fire escape fall, Wraith got +2 armour from a Mack being a cushion. That went surprisingly well for him.</blockquote>\nI'll talk more about it after I get more play out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407681/#Comment_407681" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-01T09:27:43+00:00" title="March  1, 2013  9:27AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great!

Keep in mind that this is a new system and it so it should be easier and more malleable than trying to port this into AW, yet still I struggle a tiny bit. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So yeah, Pain and Serious, I just changed to Mild injuries and Serious injuries. Don't know if I like this since a lot of the Pain choices aren't injuries so much as hindrances and narrative misses. Any suggestions on this one?<br/><br/>Also, what do you think would be the best way to integrate this as to how it pertains to NPC's? Should we stick with the original AW harm number values? Create custom list of NPC Pain and Serious Shit so instead of inflicting harm you inflict these narrative cues instead against them? I also have to keep Groups (gangs) in mind as well. <br/><br/>Any suggestions from people who have used this system or just have a good idea or two to offer would be invaluable. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred" title="watergoesred"><img alt="watergoesred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6681148/Account%20icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred">watergoesred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408386/#Comment_408386" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T14:19:24+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  2:19PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2013 2:19PM by watergoesred.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Pain and Serious Shit are aptly named.

(Maybe on really good rolls, the players choose?)<br/><br/>However, the only real advantage I can see over just describing harm narratively (which is how it already works in AW, since NPCs don't have harm clocks) is that it allows you to track a character's damaging power more accurately.<br/><br/>Still, it could be interesting to explore. For instance, for a gang:\n<blockquote><b>Gang Harm Effects</b><br/>* The gang is shaken, frightened, or stopped in its tracks<br/>* The gang suffers a few minor casualties<br/>* The gang suffers dramatic casualties; few remaining<br/>* The gang is separated, scattered, or breaks formation<br/>* The gang loses their leader or leadership<br/></blockquote>\nOn a "hit" from a worthwhile foe (maybe a 7-9 on a battle move), the MC chooses one effect for the gang. On a strong hit (like "inflict terrible harm", or from a larger gang, or on a 10+ from a battle move of some kind), the MC chooses two effects. Once an effect is applied, it's no longer available: you must pick a different one next time.<br/><br/>Some moves (or maybe even a really high roll, or an advanced move) allow a player to choose the option or options, instead.<br/><br/>So, we open fire on a rival gang. We roll 7-9, the MC says we kill a few of them (minor casualties). But she could also choose to say we killed the leader, or that the gang scatters under our fire.<br/><br/>If we rolled 10+, or had some appropriate move, the MC might say that we kill the leader *and* the gang is scattered. The battle's probably over at this point, or heavily in our favour!<br/><br/>Maybe a special character in the game has a move which allows him to choose an option. So that character could roll a 7-9 and still choose "the gang suffers dramatic casualties; few remaining"). Brutal!<br/><br/>Anyway, that's all just thinking out loud. Not playtested or even thought through! Maybe someone will do something with it, though.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred" title="watergoesred"><img alt="watergoesred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6681148/Account%20icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred">watergoesred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409517/#Comment_409517" name="Item_174" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T18:04:24+00:00" title="March 18, 2013  6:04PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another Technoirworld game with your harm hack.<br/><br/>Its pretty easy to get serious shit result and they can be pretty harsh, which I like but has a quite a different feel to the standard harm move. Seizing by force can be a lot more punishing.<br/><br/>We tried the healing move with the angel kit and it didn't make much sense. It talks all about 3:00, 6:00, 10:00 but your harm hack circumnavigates all that talk. I realised I'd have to back track and translate harm back into the countdown clock. <br/><br/>So I'm going to have to rewrite the healing move to fit the hack. On the plus side I imagine it can be a simpler move; just remove this many harm effects with these complications. I'll also probably make it emulate the better meds available for a cyberpunk world\u2014if you have the dough.
