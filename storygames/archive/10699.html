You can read my full con report<a href="http://willowrants.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/oshcon-2009-report/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Anyway, we met some guys, and played some games.  First there was Zombie Cinema, which included some macho posturing.  The group included two local students at the university, who I have mentally dubbed Tuff Guy and Buddy.  After Zombie Cinema, We chat a bit about games. Tim suggests 3:16 for these guys- of course!<br/><br/>Tim plays his experienced character- Sgt. Guido. Guido\u2019s a badass. Like really badass. He started the session at FA 10, NFA 5. He\u2019s almost plateaued for his advancement. Tim was worried he would overshadow the other characters, but in practice, it wasn\u2019t an issue. Other guys made characters: Tuff Guy was Cpl. Shatter (which I gave him based on his NFA, rather than FA, since the Sgt slot was already taken), Buddy was Trp. Salty (actually named something else, but very close to Salty, and Salty stuck), and the guy who played Sign in Stranger, IAWA, and Zombie Cinema with us played Trp. Shitstorm. I love a good nickname like that.<br/><br/>Planet was an asteroid belt involving Shadow Beasts, tenebral creatures made of shadow. Alien Ability was Reduced Visibility- no damage at Far Range. As written, this says no side does damage at Far, but I somehow missed that- I had my Aliens doing damage at Far. However, the squad emerged quite victorious.<br/><br/>Narratively, Trp. Salty took the brunt of the damage, with the Black Dog/Hound of Tindalos-like Shadow Beasts frequently using him as a chew toy. After landing and digging in, the squad got a distress call from (sometimes PC) Lt. Brillo. Guido sighed, and led his squad to save Brillo, and then they took out an alien structure of some sort.<br/><br/>Then we took a break for lunch.<br/><br/>After lunch, we had all our players from Part I, and three more, (one of whom played in both missions last year!) though one dropped early in because he had to be somewhere else. Our fifth character was a clever NFA oriented guy, who saw every situation as an opportunity to use NFA, and he usually succeeded. I loved having this guy in the game.<br/><br/>So, what I like to do for 3:16 games is run them in batches of two planets- one pretty straightforward kill-the-aliens possibly-meatgrinder planet, and a more nuanced planet with more squad politics and emphasis on the NFA objectives. I did a couple of things for that.<br/><br/>One, my aliens were Corrupt Troopers. Theta Troop (the book calls them Companies, but I use the term Troop) had gone rogue, and settled on a planet and Beta Troop was sending in a small squad of badasses to deal with them. Mission objectives included taking the leader, Major Jung, alive. The Troopers had the ability of Armor which they used to good effect- the first round of every single combat, I failed, and every PC succeeded on their checks, so of course I used my Armor. Also, the players were keen to loot the bodies- I allowed them a NFA roll to either patch (recover) their armor OR gain a 1-round worth of usage for one of the weapons on the sheet. (Limited ammo packs, etc.)<br/><br/>So Major Jung decides that the 3:16 is being sent to worlds that pose no real current threat to Earth, pretty much just so the Xenotechnological arm of the Brigade (Xenos Troop) can do weapons research. So after one too many hell worlds and one too many worlds of slaughtering civilians, they give up the ghost and dig out a bunker somewhere under the desert.<br/><br/>While Lt. Guido is piecing this together and deciding what to do about it, I introduce another NPC-related arc: Trooper Johnson.<br/><br/>See, Tuff Guy had been accusing lots of things of being gay: Captain Perlman, their mission briefing officer, Cpl. Salty, and pretty much anything he the player didn\u2019t like. So I wanted to see what he\u2019d do confronted with an honest to goodness gay NPC.<br/><br/>Trooper Johnson was a fresh recruit. He was intelligent and well-trained, but a little na\xefve. He was also gay. Not flamingly gay or anything, but gay. He had a bit of a crush on his CO, Cpl Shatter (Tuff Guy\u2019s character.) During Pod-Drop, Trp Johnson is awfully friendly, and idealistic. Trp. Shitstorm bets he won\u2019t last. The pod is shot down. To everyone\u2019s surprise, Johnson does not die in the crash. Cpl. Shatter pretends to be dead as a gag against the new guy, and Johnson shouts out \u201cNo! I never got to tell you-\u201d but Shatter startles him before I can finish.<br/><br/>Later, Johnson is awfully helpful towards another trooper during weapons inspection. And that\u2019s when Tuff Guy says \u201cwait a minute, is he gay?\u201d<br/><br/>There wasn\u2019t another \u201cthat\u2019s so gay\u201d type remark from the player for the rest of the session.<br/><br/>Cpl. Shatter did pull off his fake-death trick again, and Johnson did get to tell him he loved him. Guido got to say \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell, Trooper.\u201d Guido did take Jung captive after a faked surrender/prisoner-exchange, though Jung tried to get him to tell the brass they were all dead. Trp. Johnson piloted their Drop Ship during the final fight to get back into orbit, and earned a medal. Good times.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237324/#Comment_237324" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T21:39:49+00:00" title="October 13, 2009  9:39PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds pretty awesome. 3:16 is great for that kind of play, looks like you pulled it off quite well!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237494/#Comment_237494" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T12:56:08+00:00" title="October 14, 2009 12:56PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great game!

Then have Tuff Guy have to put up with being the "odd man out" as it were.  Of course, that is ham-fisted as all get out and would have dominated play instead of firmly guiding it back to Killing in the Name of Holy Terra (where it belongs).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
