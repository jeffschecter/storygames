And I know I've neglected some things to where their existence hardly accrues at all to my creative identity. So all of the games on the list, including the three by me, are because I'm thinking about the kinds of neglect and disadvantage that contribute most powerfully to a game not being part of the designer's creative identity.<br/><br/>Some of the games, like Mridangam and Thy Vernal Chieftains, were for sale at one point, but now aren't. Some of them exist only as blog posts, or forum posts, or on Scribd, or on some website unlinked from the designer's website. Some of them are by designers with prickly online personalities. At least one of them is by a designer who's banned from posting at RPG.net. And with a couple of exceptions they're all mostly not accruing much to the creative identities of their designers.<br/><br/>But they also all have advantages that I think might mitigate against the neglect and disadvantage. Some have been profiled on Play This Thing, or on Rob Lang's Free RPG Blog. Some are by women designers. Some have in-yer-face titles. Some are nicely illustrated or have clever graphic design. One is by an RPG.net user with a +31,000 post count. Some have benefited from actual play threads by influencers like Ron Edwards. Some were released under an open license. Some are by designers with popular blogs, or a webcomic, or who've recently published other RPGs which have captured good enthusiasm. Some are by designers with prickly online personalities.<br/><br/>So, I could have put fifty games on the list and it still wouldn't have been scientific. I'm just curious to be thinking about how and when games still accrue to the creative identities of their designers despite disadvantage and neglect.<br/><br/>Some of my thoughts:\n<ul><br/>If you read novels you pay attention to the names of authors. (Unless, I guess, you only read series romances or media tie-in novels.) But lots of respondents have said they recognize game titles, but can't name the designers. In this, I'm thinking, RPG design is not like being a novelist. <br/><br/>The way different obscure RPGs were recognized on RPG.net vs. story-games shows me that the two communities are very distinct.<br/><br/>The games I'm thinking about the most are the ones in the middle of the pack, the ones with recognition beyond the designer's true fans, but which are still quite neglected. There Is No Spoon, and The Farm aren't truly as neglected as Mridangam and Zenobia and Crime and Punishment. What about these middle of the pack games has them still accrue to the creative identities of their designers when similarly neglected games like Among the Beautiful Creatures, Awesome Women Kicking Ass, and The Niche Engine don't?<br/><br/>Only one respondent, Jamey Crook, could name me as the designer of all three of my obscure games on the list. Seems to be past time for that restraining order. In retrospect I should never have shrugged off the Horsies of Happiland incident.</ul>\nPaul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297797/#Comment_297797" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T11:50:47+00:00" title="October 21, 2010 11:50AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you suppose the vast disparity between here and RPG.net on Mrindagam has something to do with S-G's having more academic game design theory readers, or with Shreyas' (at least one-time) visibility on this site vs that one?<br/><br/>Ditto Rock of Tahamaat - Baker introduced it publicly (on his blog) as an example to illustrate his ideas about IIEE, which is a little like publishing in PUSH.

For example, most people have heard of <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, but far less have heard of Harper Lee. Similarly, I'm familiar with the whole <i>Twilight</i> phenomenon, but I can't at this moment think of the author's name (and as I try, I keep coming up with the name of another author who has written a bunch of vampire books, the titles of which I cannot recall).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297811/#Comment_297811" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T12:54:05+00:00" title="October 21, 2010 12:54PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stephanie Meyer!

Even selling via retail seemed to have minimum overlap. They've done experiments where they will place the same product for sale on different sites in different staggered orders to see if the difference of availability will shoot up sales from one source. Generally things were pretty consistent except for their hardcore fans that buy from their website.

I'm not so sure I'd read as much into that as you have.<br/><br/>I mean, yeah, I pay attention to the authors of novels that I <i>read.</i>  But I also pay attention to the authors of games I <i>play</i>.

I know there's some book out there called Eat, Pray, Love but I haven't read it and I don't know (or particularly care) who wrote it.<br/><br/>To the extent that there is a difference, I think it's notable enough that well-known authors are often (but not always) well-known in a particular genre -- Stephen King has written outside of horror, but not all that often.  In contrast, a game designer tends to be much more far-ranging in his designs -- whether it's moving from kill puppies for satan to Mechaton, or someone like the author of Tramp Freighters for the Star Wars d6 RPG apparently going on to write some other non-Star Wars RPG books (Mark Rein(dot)Hagen).<br/><br/>So knowing that The Vampire Lestat was written by Anne Rice and hey maybe I'd like to read The Mayfair Witches has a certain plausibility to it, while deciding that I really liked Orkworld so maybe I'll give Wilderness of Mirrors a try is a little more tenuous.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298024/#Comment_298024" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-22T15:09:54+00:00" title="October 22, 2010  3:09PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is no Spoon has more recognition on RPG.net because the author, Steve Darlington, posts there, a lot.

White Wolf, by comparison, didn't even put designer credits on the boxes for its board games, where it is more common practice these days to do so.<br/><br/>RPGs are sometimes designed by committee, however, which can be difficult on attribution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298199/#Comment_298199" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-25T12:42:33+00:00" title="October 25, 2010 12:42PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ffilz</cite><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>I would say that RPGs (and games in general) have less prominent designer credit than books have author credit - but this has changed a lot over the past 10 years.</blockquote>\nIs that true?

Certainly some of the "corporate" games might have less focus on designer credit.<br/>Well, an objective measure is where and how prominently the designer is credited on the packaging.  For most novels, the name of the author is on the front cover and usually on the spine as well.  I haven't done an exhaustive study, but I think this was uncommon among RPG books.  Often the author's name wasn't on the covers at all, and you had to look inside in order to see the designer's name.  As another marker, the Origins Awards and several other industry awards would announce the winning games and their producing companies - but not the designer.  <br/><br/>This is more of an issue with corporate games - like Star Frontiers, which didn't have any designer credit at all, just "TSR Staff."  However, it has also true of many small press games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298205/#Comment_298205" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-25T13:42:15+00:00" title="October 25, 2010  1:42PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, ok, quick survey:<br/><br/>Traveller (1977 boxed set): box: no, book cover: no, quick look, not even credited inside the bookx<br/>RuneQuest (1978 book): yes, partial on cover, also on 2nd edition cover and boxed set cover<br/>Dungeons and Dragons (original collectors edition box): yes on box cover and each book including supplements<br/>Tunnels &amp; Trolls (some edition I have): yes on cover<br/>Melee and Wizard (covers from Google): no<br/>Adventures in Fantasy: yes<br/>AD&amp;D: yes<br/>Chivalry &amp; Sorcery (1st ed): yes<br/>Metamorphosis Alpha: yes<br/>Gamma World (1st ed): Box: no, book cover: yes <br/><br/>Certainly with the later corporate games, designer credits are more buried (and may also be team designed - any credit may just list the lead designer(s)).<br/><br/>I can't as quickly check out games from the later 80s and 90s.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298206/#Comment_298206" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-25T13:46:34+00:00" title="October 25, 2010  1:46PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It also seems to me that the magazines of the day regularly mentioned designers names (I certainly know the folks involved with Traveller despite not finding the names in the original set at a quick glance).
