Written works also have to fit into specific academic formats. Which explains why academic articles are often hard to read, and why it's not always clear what's so important about them.<br/><br/>Note that writing about role-playing theory is <i>not</i> the same thing as writing an academic paper. It's quite possible to write about theory in an engaging and useful way. But a paper for an academic journal is a very specific thing - and, sadly, criteria for publication do not include "engaging" or "useful". Making your paper a fun read is completely optional, in other words. (Just like making your rules text useful for people outside your circle/sub-culture is optional, not required, in indie publishing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185789/#Comment_185789" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-03T04:41:24+00:00" title="January  3, 2009  4:41AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 3, 2009 4:42AM by Graham.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do you think of the journal from an academic perspective, Matthijs?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185792/#Comment_185792" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-03T05:14:52+00:00" title="January  3, 2009  5:14AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read it yet, only had a brief glance.

The two remaining articles are from different (i. e. digital) ponds, which is good; diversity in theory is needed, and I'd love to see thinking from different disciplines unite.

Especially in an interdisciplinary journal like this one, in which the contributors come from a variety of different backgrounds and research perspectives, it's important to ensure that articles are accessible to colleagues and interested parties from outside your discipline.  While it's not necessarily the case that they'll be instantly accessible to the educated masses ("New York Times readers," as my boss likes to call them), it's one thing to use academic language and jargon to make it clearer what you're talking about (frex. "Defining 'roleplaying' is assisted by Wittgenstein's notion of 'family resemblance' (Footnote), as there are a number of distinct traditions of practice that are all considered to be 'roleplaying' by their practitioners.") and another to make what you're saying seem more high-falutin' than it actually is, as if you're trying to prove your chops as a scholar or show that roleplaying is something worth studying seriously.<br/><br/>However, I'm loathe to criticize the IJRP <i>as an endeavor</i>, because -- in the desert of academic roleplaying studies -- it's a welcome addition to the annual Nordic convention books and... well, that's about it.  Otherwise we're forced to squat like vultures around the game studies / ludology / virtual worlds academics and piece together stuff from various forums, blogs, and five-year-old Forge articles.  So I'm all for criticizing the articles individually, yes, but I also think the folks responsible for putting this together should be encouraged to keep doing it and make it even better, since it's definitely a worthwhile and difficult project.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trey%20Greer" title="Trey Greer"><img alt="Trey Greer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trey%20Greer">Trey Greer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185796/#Comment_185796" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-03T06:16:16+00:00" title="January  3, 2009  6:16AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As part of my personal value set, I really enjoy theory, thus the journal, in concept, really appeals to my taste.

It draws a definition of "roleplaying game" intended to cover everything that's commonly called an RPG. That's rather difficult, when you're including console RPGs.<br/><br/>The definition it ends up with, broadly, is that a RPG has: an imaginary world, which you're free to explore; players, who affect the evolution of the game world; characters, that develop; characters interact with the world; there's a narrative element.<br/><br/>It's a difficult definition. It seems to rule out Polaris and The Shab Al-Hiri Roach (no GM), but rule in Grand Theft Auto IV and Bioshock. The Game Master criterion is particularly difficult: it rules out GMless games and, for console games, requires inventing a digital Game Master.<br/><br/>I find the writing rather difficult, too. The conclusion doesn't actually summarise the article: it seems to be a continuation of the discussion. It's also hard to understand what the article is about from reading the abstract.<br/><br/>The second paper looks quite good. It defines different sorts of roleplaying games, and the tasks within them, quite successfully.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jiituomas" title="Jiituomas"><img alt="Jiituomas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jiituomas">Jiituomas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185814/#Comment_185814" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-03T12:58:12+00:00" title="January  3, 2009 12:58PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: Brand_RobinsBut... so far my academia journal background is making me flinch.

On the contrary. It's only natural that a first perceptions sparks such reactions. And Brand's comments on similarity with other young media do ring rather true - after 13 published articles (several peer reviewed, others lighter and directly practical) I still do feel rather defensive in writing about why I feel rpgs deserve to be studied. i need to work that out of my system, eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look at other online (and quite respected) media on similar subjects, such as the journals Simulation &amp; Gaming and Gaming &amp; Culture, you'll see the same sorts of baby steps in the beginning, with a development towards very rigorous criteria, as well as a simultaneous request for practicality. These things take time to develop. Therefore I've been _very_ pleased by comments (here and elsewhere) from people like Brand who, despite preconceptions, want a good look at the contents as they really are.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a final note to my dear ever-critical friend Matthijs: Some of us do feel rather liberated by being able to produce differing sorts of articles in differing media - the fact that Markus and myself have also often contributed to the KP books does not mean we're trying to make this journal similar to the KP books. Classical composers wrote symphonies for one audience, yet concertos for others. This just might be a similar case, up to and including professional academic game researchers contributing to various media because they want to support various projects by adding generally useful material and findings to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nA toddler's steps, indeed.

It's too early to take stock and re-categorize everything that's happening in roleplaying today. Being concerned with classification isn't nearly as important as actually analyzing what's happening.

I do not consider it valid as a definition.<br/><br/>As stated by someone else in this thread, the use of the term "GM" present obvious problems; they have to invent a GM for the console-games. That in itself should have had the writers of the paper looking for the underlying principle surfacing as a "GM" in many rpg's, and presented that principle with a clarifying name, as part of the definition. They did not, and that is a significant weakness in their approach.<br/><br/>I have not read the discussion in detail, but I suspect this may be the case for other parts of the definition too.<br/><br/><div>***</div><br/><br/>But apart from that: kudos to them for writing it!

Thanks for posting.<br/><br/>The bits I found most enlightening are the Oblivion article and <i>parts</i> of the World of Warcraft article: the blow-by-blow description of getting involved in a Guild is well worth reading. (I'm aware I've chosen the two most accessible articles, which perhaps isn't fair.)<br/><br/>The first two articles are ambitious: they both, in their way, try to define roleplaying games. Neither is entirely successful, but it's such an ambitious topic that you wouldn't necessarily expect them to be.<br/><br/>Actually, in a sense, I'm almost more interested to see the second issue of IJRP. Perhaps there was an inevitable pressure, in the first issue, to do big things like <i>define</i> roleplaying games. If the second issue is more modest in the subjects it tackles, it could be interesting.<br/><br/>The hermeneutic article looks good, and I have a feeling it's saying something very useful about how theory discussions work, but I'm not sure I've got the prior knowledge to understand it entirely.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185854/#Comment_185854" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-03T21:18:51+00:00" title="January  3, 2009  9:18PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jiituomas</cite>Yet I no longer consider them "role-playing games" as such, but rather "story-telling games".

Are there liminal cases that stretch these boundaries?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jiituomas" title="Jiituomas"><img alt="Jiituomas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jiituomas">Jiituomas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185856/#Comment_185856" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-03T22:09:33+00:00" title="January  3, 2009 10:09PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I personally wouldn't feel very confident writing about "story-telling games" yet. They're too recent a development. In ten years, maybe, as we really see enough games with things like the heavily shared character ownership of Polaris emerge. I personally draw a line between game types based on mostly character control and integrity, but that's probably just a trait of me coming from a very character-immersive playing culture. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the "definition" articles, I imagine that many professional researchers within the field eventually need to publish a definition on what they're studying. Partially for the sake of having a hypothesis to build their works upon, partially in order to provoke discussion on the subject. I personally don't agree with the "needs a GM" view, but it does raise some interesting thoughts in my head about the ways in which we define role-playing games. A big part of the academic process is to write something that people will eventually refute, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185870/#Comment_185870" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T06:26:15+00:00" title="January  4, 2009  6:26AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Jonathan's comments correspond most closely with my own view, since they emphasize the fragmented character of academic scholarship on (tabletop) role-playing games, which is nowhere near disciplinary status, and probably never will be. But given that you can study whatever you want, why wouldn't you study something that fascinates you? That you love? And why wouldn't you encourage the development of an academic community pursuing similar interests? Jared's snarky comment about the masturbatory nature of such efforts reflects the scorn of the real-world practitioner for the ivory-tower theorist, who is <i>always behind</i> the cutting edge of practice and so seems hidebound and bumbling.<br/><br/>From an institutional perspective, it seems to me that those of us interested in studying RPGs as academics need to acknowledge that the recent surge in interest in video games as a social and cultural phenomenon is our best bet as a point of entry for finding a scholarly audience. For example, I'm going to a popular culture studies conference in February where I'll present a paper called "The Ironical Rhetoric of the Real in RPG Play" (which I also submitted to Solmukohta/Knutepunkt); the call for papers for the conference listed "Tabletop RPG Design/Theory" as a potential topic within the domain of video game studies. <br/><br/>Given that, it seems that one of the things that IJRP has to do--and that you see it doing--is stress the equivalence of on-line games like WoW with table-top RPGs in order to convince that larger scholarly audience interested in videogames of the relevance of the journal's work to that audience's project. Because the currency of scholarly communication is attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
