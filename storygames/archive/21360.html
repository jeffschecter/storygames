And I hope that by answering to my criticism you might maybe reveal more of your intentions and plans for this move, and its context (why do you need a diceless Parley? why do you need a friendly Parley?)<br/><br/>I'm not sure your move is effective in doing what you want it to do. I'll compare it with my own version of Parley/Manipulate, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/467278/#Comment_467278" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>First of all, in my mind all communication is, inherently, manipulation. You could use words that sound less nefarious to you, but at its core you manipulate everyone you ever speak to.<br/>And the Parley move represents this.<br/>The PC has doesn't need to have malevolent intent, they are not necessarily trying to screw over the NPC. How open or sincere this is, it is for the <b>fiction</b> to establish, <b>how</b> you hit the trigger. But the trigger itself only depicts a PC asking something out of an NPC.<br/><br/>This part is much the same as your move. Also because your trigger is very generic and does not really promote honesty and friendliness in any way.\n<blockquote>When you petition someone, suggest a course of action and explain why he should do it.</blockquote>\nI could do exactly what you prescribe here, with my PC mentioning the very likely death of the NPC's family to explain why they should do what I ask of them. Or blatantly lying.\n<blockquote>If he is open to the idea but wishes to negotiate, the GM will tell you that he requires:</blockquote>\nAgain, they might be "open" because of fear, or greed, or convenience. The move does not really shape the fiction.<br/><br/>Now, as to the mechanical bit.<br/>Either the NPC says YES outright, because it feels obvious to the MC, or... or they negotiate... which reading your options means 3 possible things:<br/>1 - have the PC offer a concrete gesture of reassurance<br/>2 - get something in return (question: is the PC required to pay up first? If not, they could lie, or unwittingly lie if circumstances make it impossible to pay later)<br/>3 - settle for a lesser service<br/><br/>Personally I have always had problems with option 1.<br/>Usually the Player simply tries to repeat all the good reasons why the NPC should cooperate, or is at a loss for presenting up-front some kind of proof of their good will and honesty.<br/>Being honest was never an issue at this stage.<br/>Coughing up a viable proof is.<br/><br/>The rest could work, as in the normal move.<br/>But then what you really achieve with this move is:<br/>- you strip away the PC ability to just be plain convincing and charismatic, which is what the normal 10+ option represents<br/>- you take away the MC ability to <b>not have an opinion</b> about a random negotiation, delegating the result to the dice (10+ means the NPC is on board, 7-9 means the NPC feels like haggling)<br/>- you take away the game's ability to have some unexpected problem come out of an obviously tense situation ... (maybe the NPC is in agreement with the PC but a 1-6 roll interrupts somehow the peaceful and honest negotiation)<br/><br/>In exchange for this losses you get:<br/>- one less die roll ... which I can appreciate, and maybe it's a critical feature for your project<br/><br/>In addition to this, just like the normal DW/AW1 move, it lacks in definition about the consequences of the haggling part.<br/>So I ask you to do X.<br/>You say no, unless I provide Y.<br/>What happens if I refuse now? Or if I'm willing but unable? What if I have a counter-proposal?<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>So you get none of the fictional effects you hoped for.<br/>You renounce a bunch of positive mechanical effects.<br/>But you avoid one roll.<br/><br/>If you tell us why you feel the need for a different Parley/Manipulate move, maybe it would also be possible to come up with suggestions and ideas, if you want them <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467515/#Comment_467515" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-06T20:32:32+00:00" title="November  6, 2017  8:32PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it it.<br/><br/>I would change it to:<br/><br/>When you petition someone on equal footing, suggest a course of action and explain why they should do it.<br/><br/>If they are open to the idea the MC picks one that they require before they agree. <br/><br/>\u2022 Truthful evidence of your words.<br/>\u2022 Compensation for services rendered.<br/>\u2022 Assistance with a troubling matter.<br/>\u2022 The support / guidance / decree of another.<br/>\u2022 An alternative that poses less risk.<br/>\u2022 An oath of fealty.<br/>\u2022 An offering of something precious.<br/><br/>If they are open to the idea but want to negotiate the MC picks two.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The reason for this is your player first needs to establish equal footing in the fiction.

Gating social interactions behind ability scores and dice rolls reduces player agency because it creates a situation where the "talky" characters are pushed to dominate social encounters while those who are not "talky" are relegated in a background roll. Good game design creates gameplay where characters can contribute to every sort of expected encounter within the game. No one should be locked out of participation, and in my experience, foisting dice rolls onto the players does exactly that.<br/><br/>In my most recent 5e game, for instance, there was some difficulty with this: the characters good at social skills wanted to overshadow the characters poor at social skills because, well, why would you let the character with a+0 roll to intimidate when you could have the character with a +10 roll to intimidate? The socially weak characters would be talking and the socially strong characters would express frustration at not being to use their social skills: either I would allow the weak characters to negotiate and give them their desire sans rolling (causing the strong characters to feel as though they "wasted" their skills on social skills) or I would have the weak characters roll (causing the strong characters to feel as though the weak characters were hampering the group's progress).<br/><br/>Obviously, this disharmony is a matter of mismatched player expectations.<br/><br/>I must emphasize that this is for friendly negotiations because it does not involve the risk that another type of roll encompasses. The manipulation / seduction / intimidation presents a danger that could very well escalate or backfire. As this does not have any danger, there is no roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467518/#Comment_467518" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-07T04:03:56+00:00" title="November  7, 2017  4:03AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hehehe those negotiations are not friendly.

In real life, of course the friendly trader would force a bad deal on the socially weak PC when the others aren't looking, just like the goblin will stab the wizard in the back because the wizard has no armor. But everyone is friendly, so social conventions dictate that we pretend the trader didn't do it on purpose (even the trader has to pretend! Her brain isn't allowed to consciously acknowledge it as long as everyone is still "friend"!), and later victim-blame the weak one a bit in the form of friendly jabs about always making bad deals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467519/#Comment_467519" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-07T10:39:58+00:00" title="November  7, 2017 10:39AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2017 10:40AM by Hasimir.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [edit]<br/>Damn, the more I try to be concise, the longer my posts get <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/>Sorry for this.<br/>I hope that at least what I say can be found to be useful in some way &gt;___&lt;<br/>[edit]<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">@ValyrianSteelKatana</a> I see.<br/>But I disagree on your analysis of what "rolling for Persuade" does.<br/><b>In D&amp;D yes</b>. That is how it works depending on many factors: the GM, the Players, etc.<br/>The roll has no meaning beside providing a Yes/No outcome based on a rating + luck rather than on actual roleplaying.\n<blockquote>Gating social interactions behind ability scores and dice rolls reduces player agency.</blockquote>\nIt depends.<br/>First of all, my personal bigger issue is that Player agency is truly reduces when you gate social interactions behind... social interactions :P<br/>Without a mechanic, or with a mechanic that puts all critical decisions on the GM's shoulders, you are forcing Players to be proficient orators/hagglers/persuaders <b>in real life</b>, at the table, persuading their friends (and specifically the GM) that their idea and argument is good and merits to happen as they describe it.<br/><br/>This, to me at least, is so much worse than having a poor social rating and then having the agency to evaluate your risk/success chances, or find a different way to reach your goal that involves a different and better rating, or somehow bypasses the roll completely.<br/><br/>Second... the mechanics in AW (or, which PbtA are you building this move for?) don't create a gate, for so many reasons.<br/><br/>a) Even a PC with -1 Hot still has an abundantly fair chance at success (45% of rolling a 7-11, not considering the gauss effect of 2d6, that makes middle results more frequent). That's hardly a gate :P<br/><br/>b) Even on a 1-6 the action itself might still succeed. The MC only has a Hard move to make. So in many occasions, as the book itself suggests, a 1-6 means <b>you succeed</b> but at the same time some unexpected shit happens.<br/><br/>c) there are just so many ways in which a PC could produce a +1 Forward to their roll, even in a pinch, even in a split second... just Read a Sitch, or Read a Person. And on the same lines, there are so many moves that allow you to roll+A instead of roll+B. Or again, moves that give you Holds or special effects that establish a flat success on a social interaction, if you are willing to behave in the way necessary to trigger the move.<br/><br/>This is not to say that in AW having success is easy.<br/>It is. But the point is that in AW the design purposefully offers a Player a wide variety of ways to reach their goal <b>through the fiction</b> (aka: through narration and roleplay).<br/><br/>That said. Yeah. Maybe not everyone is as good at just being charismatic and persuasive as the Skinner or the Bard or the guy with +3 in whatever social rating this one PbtA uses.<br/>But that's what produces interesting game, prompting players to find alternative solutions if they don't like their mechanical odds for this one specific approach.<br/><br/>And then, there is the issue of why a Move exists at all.<br/>Usually, it is to represent a cliche or trope of the target genre... it's not just "<i>what a PC might do</i>" in a general sense, but "<b><i>what a PC might do in this specific genre/setting, and how they will do it</i></b>".<br/><br/>What does your move say in this regard?<br/>What you posted originally, to me, reads like this:<br/>Characters are negotiating a thing. The GM has arbitrarily decided that the NPC needs convincing. But there is no tension between them, this is a friendly situation among honest peers!<br/>So the GM will say whatever: here is a handy list of haggling suggestions.<br/><br/>mmm<br/><br/>I would have you consider something more in the vein of <b>Charming and Open</b>, from the DW Bard playbook.<br/>It a diceless move.<br/>It requires, to be triggered, that the Bard offers some frank and open conversation in which they will be exposed (they will have to answer truthfully to one question) ... if they do, they then can ask a question to the person they are talking to, which will have to answer truthfully in return.<br/>This move stirs the fiction in a specific direction. And substitutes the dice roll with a fair trade: a truth for a truth. Which in and of itself might be dangerous, depending on the circumstances.<br/>Here's the original DW text:\n<blockquote>When you speak frankly with someone, you can ask their player a question from the list below. They must answer it truthfully, then they may ask you a question from the list (which you must answer truthfully).<br/><br/>Whom do you serve?<br/>What do you wish I would do?<br/>How can I get you to                       ?<br/>What are you really feeling right now?<br/>What do you most desire?</blockquote>\nThis is instead my personal revised version of it, for the Unplayable Fantasy game:\n<blockquote>When you speak frankly with someone...<br/><br/>...their Player has to choose one of the questions from the <i>Read a Person</i> list, if you answer truthfully you can then ask two questions from the same list.<br/></blockquote>\nMaybe something along these lines might be a more gameable and interesting path for your "friendly haggle" move?<br/><br/>Like... <br/>If I expose myself by being open and truthful (this should be defined in a specific way somehow) I get in return a better/easier bargain. Maybe I get bonuses or holds or something to then use on the normal Parley/Manipulate roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467526/#Comment_467526" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-07T18:30:19+00:00" title="November  7, 2017  6:30PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">@Guy Srinivasan</a>:\n<blockquote>Hehehe those negotiations are not friendly.

Persuasion skill checks (when the players actually roll the dice) then becomes about manipulating or forcing an NPC's hand to do what you want. The two will co-exist in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467536/#Comment_467536" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-08T00:35:56+00:00" title="November  8, 2017 12:35AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh... so you are actually using this in a D&amp;D5 game.<br/>Then... that changes things quite a lot.<br/>Sorry, this detail it was not clear to me at all &gt;__&lt;<br/><br/>Thennnnnnn ... ok. It could work. Starting from D&amp;D, you go with free play and roleplayed negotiations, then if the PC insists or tries to drive a hard bargain, then they roll.<br/>Ok.<br/><br/>I admit that I'm not convinced it will have a dramatic effect. My thoughts about how it only affects the fiction marginally are still valid, for the most part. But given these premises, I'm not so sure anymore.

It requires however that the DM is able to read instinctively how impatient are the players and how much tolerance they will have to additional obstacles. If the quest is already becoming a thread of small sub-quest and no obstacle has been tackled yet, group tolerance to additional obstacles will go down, making choices that hint to further questing trigger the classical player frustration response of kicking the table and try to get things by force. Just settling things with a dice roll is the best at those times.<br/><br/>If the quest still looks too simple and straightforward this diceless mechanic is the perfect tool to spice things up. So, it's up to the DM to notice which is the case, as it all depends on the fiction and hows the group faring so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467565/#Comment_467565" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-08T20:48:18+00:00" title="November  8, 2017  8:48PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that if you're interested in "tightening it up", you'll have to be more specific about what you want "tightened up". The list of outcomes, for instance, is already very good. The procedure is very simple (assuming that only one outcome is chosen, and then we move on).<br/><br/>However, two things come to mind in terms of *expanding* on it:<br/><br/>1. What happens when the players try to force or push the interaction? Will the NPC ever budge? When does the negotiation end - or is it always just one offer and that's it?<br/><br/>2. Now that we know that this is for D&amp;D, will the players be disappointed that their skills or attributes don't have any impact on the interaction? What if they rolled a really high Charisma or invested points in an Intimidation skill, or some other such thing?<br/><br/>What if they are disappointed about doing this without rolling any dice?<br/><br/>Combining those two ideas into one procedure gives me an idea.<br/><br/>Perhaps, once the initial offer has been made by the NPC, the player can try to force things, or to influence them one way or another. This could be a Charisma check, an Intimidation roll, Reaction roll, or whatever mechanics you use in your particular D&amp;D.<br/><br/>If the player decides to do so, things will become more or less interesting:<br/><br/>* On a poor roll (e.g. a failure), the price has just gone up. The NPC is frightened, distrustful, or offended. They name a second criteria, which, along with the first, must be satisfied to win them over.<br/><br/>You've made a misstep, and now you have to give them some evidence AND swear an oath, in other words.<br/><br/>* On a good roll (e.g. a success), the NPC is affected by the overtures. They offer another possible criteria; the PCs can now win them over by satisfying either, their choice.<br/><br/>The NPC is softening up; "If you don't have the evidence, fine, just swear an oath to me instead."<br/><br/>* On a really good roll (e.g. a success with a high margin), the NPC lessens the price or is willing to accept a halfway measure. <br/><br/>The NPC has been won over; a simple gesture will satisfy them. Instead of presenting full-on evidence, just a hint of something convincing will do. Instead of a full payment, they offer an unusually good deal, and so on.<br/><br/>This gives the players a sense of risk and reward they can apply to the interaction. Is it worthwhile to try to persuade this person? Can we frighten this barkeep? Etc.<br/><br/>I could see that being fun in play.

Do you think we should push this further?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467566/#Comment_467566" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-08T20:51:06+00:00" title="November  8, 2017  8:51PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (As an aside, <a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">@Hasimir</a>, I like your reciprocal "read a person" move.

The first steps were: (1) make a promise, (2) deliver on that promise.  Whenever you do make a request of the other party, do so with an aim that's genuinely in their best interests.  If they're reluctant, do your best to show them how it's in their best interests.  If they comply, then you have the foundation for a working relationship.<br/><br/>Not sure if that's on-topic here, but I think it's at least relevant to some of the replies above...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
