There is <a href="http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Heroica" rel="nofollow">a D&amp;D-esque series of four linked sets</a> (sold separately) where you pick a barbarian or ranger or druid (each with their own powers), and run around a little dungeon picking up gold and fighting werewolves and spiders. Hurrah! Lego D&amp;D!<br/><br/>Sadly, the game itself was not very fun to play, which blows, because a) my wife got interested in me putting it together and agreed to play, and b) $20.<br/><br/>A cursory glance around the internets did not turn up any rules hacks, but I know beyond the faintest shadow of a doubt that they are out there. I believe in the power of nerd culture. <br/><br/>Help me, Story Games. You're my only hope. Don't let that $20 have been spent in vain.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://matthewsampson.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/3858.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332982/#Comment_332982" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T13:07:45+00:00" title="July  3, 2011  1:07PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally want to get these and see what I can do with them.

The rules are a bit like a picture of things you could build - something to start on with building a better game.<br/><br/>I got a different set than the one you've got there - with a Wizard, Barbarian, and a Thief.  I'm planning on getting more sets, so I have more work with on building a larger build.<br/><br/>Ideas:<br/>1) Monsters are all about the same - the only difference really is how much damage they do.  One idea is to expand how much damage it takes to kill one off from one point always to an equal amount as the strength.  Shield results may be crits that still take them down.<br/>2) Let people buy speed and healing potions like they can buy weapons.<br/>3) After you move your own character, roll and move one of the monsters, and roll for it to attack if it ends up next to your opponent's character.<br/>4) Maybe you don't win when you get to the end - maybe you need to leave the dungeon before you leave... and your opponents can try and catch and grab the mcguffin off of you and win the game instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333014/#Comment_333014" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T21:25:26+00:00" title="July  3, 2011  9:25PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was looking forward to it since I heard about it and then when the reviews came out, lost interest. <br/>Maybe I'd use the stuff to play a minis rpg, like savage worlds or d&amp;d....<br/>But then the die is under utilized...

I got all four sets at once (because my Lego store was offering cool freebies if I did), and took it over to my friend's house a few days later. We put everything together, and we PLAYED THE HELL out of those games. We started off with the main castle set, then the next time we added some pieces from the wilderness set, and so on and so on. We played it, I think, eight times in a row.<br/>And it pretty much met my expectations as a kid's board game. But it was still pretty fun in my opinion.<br/>But yeah, the rules do state that they expect people to hack the rules (I left them all at my friend's house, so I can say for sure what the little rulebook says, but I think they also want people to post stuff they do with it?), and really, it's simple enough to hack.<br/><br/>Like, for me, I've come up with:<br/>-Characters start with abilities equal to their associated weapon (Barbarian gets the axe ability, Ranger gets the bow ability) which is slightly weaker than their normal ability. When they buy the weapon in question, the weapon boosts them to their normal level of ability (I think only the Thief gets a raw deal out of this...but hey, he's a thief). Anyone using a weapon not associated with their class essentially multi-classes, as per the normal rules.<br/>-I've been thinking of making character cards, with the regular abilities on the front, and epic-level abilities on the back, which are unlockable if they can collect and spend 10 gold at once. The epic-level ability would only last until the end of that adventure. ...not sure yet what I'd DO for the epic-level abilities...maybe just making it possible for their special abilities to work on a regular attack roll? Anyway, that is still in tinkering-mode.<br/>-Also making cards for the enemies, with special abilities for each. I mean, yeah, it's kinda cool the Dark Druid and the Bats are "flying" enemies, but there are no rules for it. Also, still in the tinkering stage.<br/><br/>...and just because I'm an uber-geek, I've been saving up some money to buy various Lego Kingdoms sets, so that I can make a regular-sized version of Heroica.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333068/#Comment_333068" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T13:40:05+00:00" title="July  4, 2011  1:40PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>...and just because I'm an uber-geek, I've been saving up some money to buy various Lego Kingdoms sets, so that I can make a regular-sized version of Heroica.</blockquote>\nTHIS!

Some people are already a little weird for the cost with what they had there.<br><br/>But consider - if you get a 2x2 round plate, and put a minifig on it, then it'll work in Heroica just fine, because the center stud on the move spaces will line up with the center round bit under a 2x2 round plate.  So with a little customization, it works fine with minifigs.  (well, it works with a 2x2 square plate, but then you have to be careful how you line up the square plate with the grid, where with a round plate you don't have to worry about it.)                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333150/#Comment_333150" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T09:00:08+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  9:00AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't purchased any of these new games but I've played a bunch of games with LEGO elements.

Love Heroica... yes its not Perfect straight out of the box maybe a little to simple (but i guess thats good for young kids), kind of like a Candyland game with fighting. But it has enormous potential and reminds me of Heroquest. That game I think is responsible for a lot of people getting into RPGs. Also lego has a great Star Wars game in the same scale. Play like a 2 player version of Feudal, and could be turned into a Star Wars Dungeon Crawler.

They arrived today (I had to ship them back home to myself from my parents' place), which spurred me to look online for house rules, and also for the availability of the remaining sets.<br/><br/>First, on the remaining sets, I learned two things: one, the line apparently is being discontinued, as most of the sets are already "retired" on Lego's site and seem to be limited or out of stock in local (Seattle-area) stores. Two, Lego released a fifth set in 2012, the Catacombs of Ilrion, which features two new heroes (the Prince and the Sage) plus the Wizard in a mostly-flooded setting against a Vampire Lord, zombies, and bats. Oddly, they include the "King of the realm" as a microfig, and explicitly mention he's a captive you're supposed to rescue from the Vampire Lord, but then don't actually have any new rules in the game to cover that idea.<br/><br/>Second, on the subject of house/variant rules, a Google search now turns up some interesting ideas, in particular on BoardGameGeek, such as this thread <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/743799/advanced-heroica-ruleset-still-under-testing" rel="nofollow">boardgamegeek.com/thread/743799/advanced-heroica-ruleset-still-under-testing</a> and this thread <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/722606/quest-heroica-new-heroica-rules-variant" rel="nofollow">boardgamegeek.com/thread/722606/quest-heroica-new-heroica-rules-variant</a>. (Aside: the BoardGameGeek forums aren't well organized. There are totally separate forums for the Heroica line in general and for each individual set, so you have to do some hunting to find discussions of variant rules.)<br/><br/>One idea I had, that I haven't seen mentioned yet (in my cursory glance at a few variant rules discussions), is to have certain tiles provide special effects if you pause a turn there. For example, the Castle set has the kitchen tile, with that big turkey leg; pausing there for a turn could fully restore your health. It also has a couple "study" tiles (with a desk and chair); pausing there to study the tome on the table could provide some other beneficial effect, like increasing your strength in combat or revealing some kind of secret passage.<br/><br/>Like everyone else, I'm also working on hacking advanced weapon and combat rules. My current version is that heroes start with strength 1, and when fighting a monster you roll for both the hero and the monster and add each's strength; the winner does the difference in the result as damage to the loser, ties are re-rolled. Most weapons increase a hero's strength by 1, but having your special hero weapon (such as the sword for the knight or the wand for the wizard) increases it by 2.<br/><br/>One thing that's kind of a drag is waiting for a Shield result on the die in order to use your hero's special skill. I feel that skills should be available by choice, but I'm not sure how to adjust that without making them overpowering. I guess the obvious limiting factor would be to drop a health point each time you use it, though I'm not sure that's sufficient. <br/><br/>Okay, I think that's enough for now\u2026                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402900/#Comment_402900" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-07T07:32:07+00:00" title="January  7, 2013  7:32AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> - Yeah, I'd be more-inclined to play a "sandboxy" game than rejigger d20 (OSR, Hero, etc, etc, etc) to use Lego elements in a static manner (sorry, Philip!).
