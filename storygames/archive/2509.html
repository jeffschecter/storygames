It is a very simple idea: make a roleplaying game that shall be played out in 15 minutes, not one second more or less. When 15 minutes is up the game is over (use a timer, if you will). That is it!<br/><br/><b>The point?</b><br/>- to focus on athmosphere rather than action...<br/>- to focus on sensitivity rather than dramatic development...<br/>- to see if it is possible to explore poetic states rather than the epic or dramatic or prosaic...<br/><br/>It is simple to write, easy to play, and so rewarding in terms of gamer and gamesmith experiences!<br/><br/><b>Feel free to try it!</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_57928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57928/#Comment_57928" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-23T16:19:55+00:00" title="February 23, 2007  4:19PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Poetic roleplaying" found it's way to Knudepunkt in Denmark last weekend, without my participation (Matthijs Holter; "Five characters seeking an identity"). I have made three such poetic games myself, all relating to soccer in some way.<br/><br/><b>Brimingham - Stoke 1-1</b>: a poetic fable about dull soccerfans on a pub in Birmingham after a dull match. Tested: very strong effect! A low key and very still game. An energydraining and beautiful experience!<br/><br/><b>Kretsfinalen!</b> (The county finals): a game about players in the wardrobe after winning the junior championship of their county by an astounding 8-0! Tested: makes for very loud gameplay. The game went from an ordinary situation and into weirdness within 15 minutes. It ended up being a thriller with the players about to get gassed in the wardrobe. Showed with shocking clarity how very, very long 15 minutes can be in real time gameplay!<br/><br/><b>Kampen mot nedrykk </b>(Battling relegation): a game about the last 15 minutes of the last match of the series. The players are players on the soccer team HamKam, playing Rosenborg on their homefield and trailing 0-2. To keep their place in the top league they have to win. This game has not been tested yet. It's the only poetic roleplaying game with a resolution system!!!  ;D I aim to test it shortly.<br/><br/>I am sorry that I don't have the games themselves to post here. They are only on handwritten sheets.

They haven't been assigned an identity yet. They can talk to each other, but not to the players or GM. They're free to speculate in what sort of characters they are, what sort of game it is etc.<br/><br/>After a while (3-5 minutes) the GM assigns the first character an identity. After that, he/she gives the other characters their identity as he/she sees fit.<br/><br/>The identities are:<br/><br/>Mother<br/>Little sister<br/>The dead dog<br/>God<br/>God<br/><br/><b>Prejudice</b><br/><br/>For 4 or 6 players.<br/><br/>Each player writes a negative descriptor on a piece of paper - such as "thief", "liar", "pervert", "no sense of humor" etc.<br/><br/>The players divide into two teams. Each team is given a name based on the first letters/syllables in the players' names. (Matt, Joe and Heather might be called "Hemjo", or whatever).<br/><br/>The papers are divided into two piles, one for each team. That shows what prejudices the other team holds for them. (Example: Hemjo people are liars and perverts).<br/><br/>The first team now has five minutes to talk about the second team. They must tell anecdotes <i>from real life</i> about the second team which confirm the prejudices. After that, the second team does the same to the first team, for five minutes. (Example: A player from the other team tells the story of when Joe cheated at a math test. Another player remembers when Heather made an unfitting remark about a young boy.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58461/#Comment_58461" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T05:46:00+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  5:46AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These seem a lot closer to improv acting drills than RPGs.

If there is a better term for it, I don't know it. <br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61133/#Comment_61133" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T18:16:46+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  6:16PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://forum.rpg.net/printthread.php?t=182904&amp;pp=200" rel="nofollow">Rpg.net thread about a game intended to be played entirely in verse.</a><br/><br/>My posts are a little past halfway through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_61150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61150/#Comment_61150" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T23:45:55+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 11:45PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "That thing which poetry possesses that is not form", I like that! You've certainly hit the nail on the head, Mendel. The intention is to create "the other experience", yes.<br/><br/>I do not make a distinction between "drama" and "prose" in this respect, though. I use "drama" in the loose sense of "conflict narration". But this is besides the point, so please let us not make it a part of this debate.<br/><br/>One of my games; <b>Birmingham Stoke 1-1</b>, is in my view the most successful of poetic roleplaying games so far. It succeeded in placing the players in a very special state of mind. It can best be described as "no energy, no clarity, no hope". After 15 minutes all players shared this state, and had internalized it, as part of their seemingly simple character (simple on the sheet, but surprisingly complex and powerful in real play).<br/><br/>Yes, I have been involved in theatre-improvisations, but this is not inspired by that, however close it may seem to some of you. It is first and foremost a kind of roleplaying game, and inspired by the possibilities opening up in this form now. In my view dialogue based roleplaying games is growing up these days, developing into a real artform (and about time too).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62021/#Comment_62021" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-24T09:41:20+00:00" title="March 24, 2007  9:41AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas, when I referenced drama versus prose, I was trying to describe how poetry is both written and performed.

The closest to that I've done is when I ran a Camarilla larp, (Changeling to be precise), and as a part of the main plot took everyone's character sheets and assigned them basic identities as people in a hospital waiting room. <br/><br/>  -  Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_148548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148548/#Comment_148548" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T04:29:40+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  4:29AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2008 4:32AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, the form relate to written poetry, and the actual play relate to the poetic state.

I have once participated in a workshop on "theatre-sport" (improvisation where the public gives theme and setting for scenes, and the actors compete against eachother, not sure about the English term), but I am not into impro-acting as such, so I do not feel qualified to pinpoint the differences.<br/><br/>There is differences, though. I do not connect the two forms at all, not any more than I connect ordinary roleplaying with acting.<br/><br/>I believe you ask me that question due to the method given in some roleplaying poems, where the lack of mechanism in the method may give raise to such sentiments. Methods without mechanics are a fairly common sight in Norwegian RPG-design these days, so it is quite natural that some Norwegian roleplaying poems share that trait.<br/><br/>My first three poems were split in this respect. One of them had no mechanics, but a fairly stringent method. One of them had no mechanics, and a weak method (the game disintegrated, and did not keep to my goal for it).  And one of them had very heavy mechnics ("heavy" for such a small game), letting the dice rule how the main conflict developed.<br/><br/>In other words: the poetic-monster has changed shapes from the beginning ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
