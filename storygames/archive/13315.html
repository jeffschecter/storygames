I'm new to this whole con thing (Gaelcon 2009 was my first ever convention) and I've only been to a handful or so (6, actually), but this was by far my best ever con experience. I think the following factors most contributed to it (in ascending order of importance):<br/><br/>1) The sign-up system. Anyone puts up a sign-up sheet, writes a quick and dirty description of what they've got in mind, and finds people to play with. Even though the blurb for my AW game was pretty lame, I found four people to play with, and they were brilliant (see point 4)<br/>2) The chalets. Now I don't mind people, but sometimes I like to be able to talk to the others around the table without shouting. Having a chalet to play in is decadently luxurious and awesome. You have snacks right there (and also your wine), it's as loud or silent as you want it to be, and when you do have to kill someone, it's so much easier to dispose of the body!<br/>3) The games. It's rare that cons ever put on something I'm really interested in, but Indiecon? Every slot had at least 3 or 4 games I really WANTED to play. It felt like they had put a hint in the name of the con that this would be a good place to play a certain kind of game. Fiasco was a victim of that, actually: even though it was run in SO MANY SLOTS (with the awesomest of sign-up sheets, too; looked like right out of the book), I always had something else I *had* to do. Did buy the book though, so will hopefully play it soon.<br/>4) The people. My god, the PEOPLE! It's almost like they handpicked attendants. With very few exceptions, everyone I played with was brilliant, welcoming, funny, and handsome.<br/><br/>The stand-out games for me personally were Apocalypse World and Montsegur 1244. AW was a much more personal thing for me. I played it with my good friend Adam at Gaelcon and it didn't quite work. We both sensed an amazing game in there, though, so we decided to try again. I had a few ideas I wanted to try, so I MCed this time, and we were lucky enough to find three amazing people who played with us (Mike, Gav and Rich--if you're reading this, thank you so much!). I'll probably make a separate thread for my thoughts on AW, but basically it boiled down to this: it allowed me to be a strong GM again, something I loved back in the day when I was playing AD&amp;D 2nd because I didn't know better. While I love pretty much everything about modern indie rpgs, I had kind of assumed that the strong GM (I have no idea what I mean by that--really should write that other thread) had no place in Indie RPGs.<br/><br/>I was wrong, and I was so happy to be wrong, and even though AW really isn't that well-suited to being a one-shot, I consider the session a success. I walked around with the widest, silliest grin on my face for the rest of the night, so that's success right there.<br/><br/>But even though AW answered a question so close to my heart in the best way possible, I think it's the session of Montsegur 1244 that I'll never forget. That session was probably the best experience I have ever had around a roleplaying table, and it was mostly with complete strangers. I had been thinking about why I never quite got the amount of serious story telling I wanted out of rpgs--and I mean serious here as the opposite of silly. I had a couple of amazing games of In A Wicked Age and PTA with my old group, and even though we always hit on great serious notes and came up with really enjoyable stories, I never truly felt depressed or moved or conflicted during those games. I really really wanted to experience these things in a game, and I thought Montsegur would be my best chance. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Frederik facilitated the game for us but then mostly just sat quietly, taking notes. Our table included Graham Walmsley, my friend Adam Kelly, Rich from the AW game (stalker!), Decklin (not sure at all about spelling) and Jane. I don't know about Decklin, but Jane said she had never really played a GM-free game, and her Raymond was brilliant. Down to earth, family man, but never quite in control over the women in his house. He lost his faith when the siege went truly bad and my Bertrand informed him that Montsegur falling had nothing to do with the credentes one way or another--our faith is not a strategy of war. <br/><br/>I played Arsende, and even though I was very happy with her story, I had a strong feeling that I was coming up with the weakest scenes around the table, which was absolutely okay for me. I was enjoying myself SO much watching the others play. I was also very very lucky with the performances I got when I put other characters in my scenes. Particularly Decklin's Amiel, when Arsende tried to make him just repeat the Consolamentum and Amiel pushed back hard, saying that this is not right, this is not how it's done, and that he's not a child anymore. <br/><br/>(Arsende and Garnier, the whore and the killer, ended up as the only two perfects in our group--Cecille had died peacefully and Bertrand was exchanged as a hostage to guarantee the truce)<br/><br/>God, I could ramble on about this for a while, too. Let me just say that I finally, FINALLY got those serious experiences I'd been looking for so long in roleplaying, and oh god did it feel good. I want more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299856/#Comment_299856" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T15:21:53+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  3:21PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was very, very good.

IndieCon has been my highlight of the British convention scene for a couple of years, now.<br/><br/>I had a stall. At GenCon, I bought lots of games I liked and wanted to support and, at IndieCon, I sold them on the stall. We did very, very well, with Fiasco and Kagematsu being particularly popular. So that was my highlight of the con: it was a pleasure and privilege to support those games.<br/><br/>Frederik Jensen, Simon Rogers and Tim Gray also bought into the stall. It was lovely to meet Frederik and I got to play Montsegur (the game Daniel describes above). Tim did well with Jaws of the Six Serpents, which has quite a following there.<br/><br/>Fiasco was played everywhere you looked.<br/><br/>There was other stuff too. We did an improvised GMing thing on Saturday afternoon, in which you invented and ran an adventure incorporating three Game Chef-style ingredients (Armadillo, Sausage and Tent).<br/><br/>I played Hell 4 Leather, Fiasco in Gangster London (superb, I played Stan Fish), Cthulhu Apocalypse (went well), The Esoterrorists (pretty good, complex, perhaps too complex), Prime Time Adventures (fantastic), an improvised Gaslight Cthulhu adventure (all kinds of fun), Montsegur 1244 (intense and good), Cthulhu Apocalypse with zombies (nice group, but I was rubbish) and Lady Blackbird (ask me privately).<br/><br/>It was great. I would encourage people to visit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielZKlein" title="DanielZKlein"><img alt="DanielZKlein" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielZKlein">DanielZKlein</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299859/#Comment_299859" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T15:41:39+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  3:41PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GB Steve, the cliffs <a href="http://twitpic.com/355wnz" rel="nofollow">looked</a> <a href="http://twitpic.com/355x7t" rel="nofollow">like</a> <a href="http://twitpic.com/355y0p" rel="nofollow">this</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299863/#Comment_299863" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T15:46:35+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  3:46PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my list.<br/><b>Hell 4 Leather (Facilitated by Rafu)</b>This is the game in which one player plays a dead biker and everyone else plays the Devil with whom he makes a pact and the other bikers whom he promises to kill. I'm not sure why the Devil wants his agents of mischief killed but still, it is something of an interesting premise for a scenario. We played it pretty straight, we were Norwegian Death Metal Bikers of the church burning variety. Simon did some pretty good grunting of the (semi-)musical variety. The Tarot is used for the game in providing themes for scenes and the resolution mechanic. The fiction is what makes characters more or less appealing to other players who have a chance to help them escape death. In the end, everyone died on the last turn of the card after escaping death for much of the game. I enjoyed the play but I don't see the need to every play it again. For me it was a scenario and whilst the tarot did provide interesting themes, I don't think there's enough in it to provide much replay value. Also I played the Fool, the central character throughout so had much more to do and much more narrative continuity of character. It seemed harder for the other players.<br/><br/><b>Hell For Leather (Facilitated by Dan)</b><br/>I'd promised Sebastian that I'd run a game at the Con. I wasn't massively familiar with the rules but fortunately Dan signed up for my game and he'd played it several times. The idea is that the characters are bound together in running away from some great threat in the pursuit of some great prize. The default setting is The Running Man but that didn't appeal so we chose Dracula. The checkpoints were Escape from Dracula's Transylvania (were everyone person, animal or blade of grass is his), Take the Mace with the Splinter of the One True Cross from the Tower of London and Return to Dracula's Transylvania (where every etc ...) to find his Tomb. We were all members of the King's College 1874 Transylvania Expedition, an Alcoholic Doctor, Oblivious Vicar, Trigger Happy Brigadier, Hot Blooded Vicar's Daughter, Fraudulent Archaeologist and Cowardly Academic. The set-up, which includes a prologue for each character introducing them and the danger, was quick, produced a decent background in which to play and gave us strong indication of the themes which would emerge. The dice flicking system, in which you have to roll close to an ever growing tower of dice without knocking it over, is fun and produces genuine involvement from the players. All signs pointed to a great game. And yet ...<br/><br/>The first act was fine we encountered the Count in the prologue and then fled from the various dangers. Everyone made their rolls and so the fiction ticked over perfectly in time. Then it all went a bit pear-shaped in the second act. The problem is that when you make your rolls, you know how many scenes it's going to take until you get the required victory points for a scene (usually three or four). If you fail a lot of rolls, or don't even make them because the tower is high (which it is by the second act) and you knock it over before rolling then you start to run foul of the fiction, especially if you fail the last roll repeatedly. <br/><br/>So, for example, if you're trying to get into the Tower and you need a key but you've only got 3 of 9 required VPs. You've got 4 VPs riding on the scene so you might expect the next scene to be the last one in pursuit of the key. So you have to set the scene so that it's close to the end but not so close that if you fail you're any nearer the end. Alternatively you could go for something close but then have a big setback, so burgling Number 10 Downing St means you get arrested if you fail. If you do get arrested then escape from prison is the simple objective although I don't know what you'd do if you failed that. So, as you can see, you have to be really careful when describing scenes. Given that all had gone smoothly in the first act, we didn't approach the second with enough care and the mood fell a bit flat.<br/><br/>The third act worked a bit better, but even then we had to introduce what seemed like extraneous fictional elements to cope with the fact that we failed rolls. I think I'd like it better if you succeeded but failures just count against you in the final act (which they do anyway because lower health means you have to throw the dice in progressively more awkward ways). There may also be a tendency to call for many rest scenes in the final act to rebuild health. I think we only had two rest scenes and that because the tower had got to 13 height, not to make it any easier at the end.<br/><br/>The finale was pretty good although the chance of winning was pretty low. We managed to do 8 of the 16 rolls required and the four deaths contributed a further 1 VP each which meant we'd killed Dracula but died in the attempt. This is a game in which skill at dice is a requisite for success.<br/><br/>So overall I think we probably did it just but maybe it's just not really my cup of tea.<br/><br/><b>Shock (Facilitated by Rafu and me)</b><br/>This was, I'm ashamed to say, my first proper game. This is all the more sad that it was all kinds of awesome to the exent that I'll do a full post on this later on. There were six of us so we ran two games.<br/><br/><b>Esoterrorists (Run by Matt)</b><br/>I've played this game before so I won't review the game just the session. We were dropped into Amsterdam (curiously also the setting for my only scenario) to deal with the death of an ex-agent. Then it all blew up in our faces. There was much interparty conflict and I went a little mad trying to kill several team members (unsuccessfully) before coming home quietly. The solution to the mystery was slightly too complicated but we did manage to avoid any kind of wide scale disaster and cover up any of the messes we made (the odd grenade through a car window). Matt did a very good job of running this, very on top of the background material and provided us with plenty of thrills and spills. The character packs were all had good stuff and whilst they were perhaps overlong, the bullet point summary was spot on. I very much enjoyed this game.<br/><br/><b>Rock of Tahamaat (Run by Rafu)</b><br/>This game was written by Vincent Baker and only exists as a post on his blog. It was devised to illustrate the four steps of the IIEE model of conflict resolution. So the first stage is initiation (whether you can bring yourself to act), then it's intent (what are you trying to do) then execution (how well you perform), and finally effect (what happens). <br/><br/>You roll dice for each of the first three stages and then effect is narrated. The first dice roll is whether you dare act at all. If you fail at this stage nothing happens. This only occurred once in the whole game but was nevertheless an interesting outcome. There were four participants in the game, one GM, the Rock of Tahamaat (Larissa) and two players (Fred and me). <br/><br/>The Rock rules his space empire with an indomitable will, the players are mere nobodies unknown to their ruler. The GM's job is to set scenes, play NPCs and resolve conflicts. In particular he has to decide before the execution what the worst and best possible outcomes would be for the character in each conflict. Rafu did a great job of setting baroque scenes in this decadent space empire. Larissa job was to play the distant Rock in his Space Palace as his will is interpreted by three ever-kneeling psychics and passed onto flunkies to enact. The Rock rolls handfuls of dice and usually his will is enacted exactly as intended. It's I--E resolution for him. Also he never mentions any person by name, working at the macro level of guilds, cities and planets from his flunkies reports. He directly affects the macro level fiction for the characters.<br/><br/>Fred played a Murderer-for-hire whose story was one of a local power struggle between him, the authorities and his boss in the guild. This lead him, after a brief imprisonment, to set up his own guild and contend for power with his boss. The Rock was mostly pleased by this initiative as it would lead to better assassins but had his flunkies infiltrate the winning guild.<br/><br/>I played a disheartened philosopher, preparing himself to die. This lead to many Vancean scenes in which he had to defend himself from keepers of the philosophers' graveyard and ended up in prison. Fomenting revolt lead to escape but also the planet being embargoed by the Rock. There was nothing else to do but to surrender to the authorities and return to his cell.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this game. Everyone gave their all and it lead to many fun scenes. I could see that the Rock's player might become bored with lack of involvement and they could possibly play the GM roll too but in this case Larissa was spot on with her disinterested manner and Rafu great at framing scenes and being the link between the micro and macro levels. My story was great fun and I'd certainly give this another go.<br/><br/><b>Monts\xe9gur (Facilitated by Frederik)</b><br/>This game is always a bit daunting at the start, you have four characters, a full relationship map and a timeline to contend with. This was only my second game but already it's one of my favourites. Fred's light touch means that all the background material is more for inspiration rather than restricting choices. Certainly the fiction provides constraints but they are never forced and feel organic. The individual instances of story goodness are too numerous to relate in full by Raimonde's discovery that his reason for housing the Cathars was built on a thirty year old lie was one stand out moment. It killed one character and destroyed the faith of a perfect.<br/><br/><b>Hot War (Run by Matt)</b><br/>Another old favourite with the same Matt GMing who ran Esoterrorist. We have rather an overlap in games we like, he played in my Trail of Cthulhu (below). This time things had got pretty rough in the Underground and we'd been sent in for a shufty. A very enjoyable game of double dealing with each other and the authorities with everyone getting under the skin of their character. I felt a bit sorry for the Intelligence Officer who got so done over by the rest of us that he faked his own death at the end of the game. But not very sorry. He had started to investigate certain unsavoury irregularities in my past and I found the simple mechanic of changing the subject very useful in disarming attacks. ('Look! A zombie!')<br/><br/><b>Trail of Cthulhu (Run by me)</b><br/>This was the second outing for my Pulp Trail game set in London in 1934 and inspired by my wife's Guide to Occult London. It was also an opportunity for me to prove to a friend that Trail was a worthwhile addition to Mythos gaming. Unfortunately, given train times I only had 3 hours for what was really a 5 hour game so things got rushed in places by me saying "you go there, you get this clue" but I think I included enough for people who hadn't played to get a good flavour of what Trail is about. I also think that the scenario is pretty much good to go for playtesting, except for the writing up bit. I'll try to contact the players and get their reactions                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299890/#Comment_299890" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T19:04:58+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  7:04PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to go to this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Arriving too late and too tired for gaming Friday night I ended up in the bar with the 6d6 game designers talking about - games of course. <br/><br/>Saturday I had signed up for running a session of Montsegur 1244 in the afternoon - as it was already filled, I put up another sheet for Saturday evening and then jumped on to Rafus session of the Rock of Tahamaat. We played that in the soft chairs in the chalet - very appropriate for the rock tyrant but perhaps a bit too comfortable for sleepy gamers <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>. I liked Steve's philosopher a lot. He wanted to die in peace after the tyrant had made him write his book on the skin of his children, bound by the skin of his parents - and then the tyrant had made him burn it. I was struggling to make my murderer-for-hire work - missing up some close relationships for him to work with. But in the end he went all in to be a cold bloded killer and not just a sportsman which was a satisfying consequence of the story. The tyrant setup worked well. The IIEE was more of a curiosity than a necessity.<br/><br/>Both Montsegur 1244 sessions went well. I playtested the expansion components and got useful feedback. In the evening game I was only explaining the rules, after which I was listening in from the corner, enjoying the scenes and noting the little details that can be improved. I know this can feel a bit awkward for the players - so thanks again for agreeing to this.<br/><br/>The afternoon game was a four player game with none of Raimond, Phillipa, Pierre Roger and Arsende being main characters - which turned out to work well. I particularly loved Simon's Garnier (young, naive, and in love) and Steve's Bertrand (it seemed as if the philosopher from the morning session carried over into this game). I had the pleasure of playing one of the new characters, the old blind man. The big reveal that the grail for which everyone had suffered so much was in fact a fake I brought home from the holy land 40 years ago came to me in the instant I said it - and it gave the story a tragic punch. One of these magic and very satisfying moments in story gaming.<br/><br/>Sunday morning I was selling Montsegur 1244 from Graham's stall to players from yesterday's sessions which is also very satisfying.<br/><br/>The food offered at the site was too much white bread, grease and lager so I sobered up with a vegetarian meal at the airport while waiting for my plane back home.<br/><br/>Advice for future visitors: Bring a towel and bring groceries and prepare your meals with friends in the very comfortable chalets.<br/><br/>Thanks to Chris, Graham, Rich, Declan, Steve, Simon, Rafu, Daniel, Jane, Adam, Tim, and all the other nice people I met at IndieCon 2010.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299937/#Comment_299937" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T00:19:03+00:00" title="November  9, 2010 12:19AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2010 12:19AM by James_Mullen.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had the brass balls to take 7 games for playtesting to the con, but my reasoning was thus: I want playtesters and people at a con will play <i>anything.</i> OK, evil, but it worked, and I got tremendous feedback from everybody who played, plus a lot of love for <b>Never to Die</b>, though this was mostly tainted love...<br/>\n<br/>\nI've posted an AP report for every game I ran, at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.groundhoggoth.co.uk/Actual-Play/" rel="nofollow">Groundhoggoth</a>, and I whole-heartedly agree with the above comments; Indiecon was awesome, full of great, committed players who realy Brought It to the games, not to mention a fantastic array of games on offer, so much that I've vowed next year to actually sign up to some other people's games!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299945/#Comment_299945" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T01:24:12+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  1:24AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah yes, the people.

Some folks were hanging around in the bar, and so I proposed a game of Fiasco. There were enough players for two full tables of Fiasco gaming goodness: I facilitated a Goonies-style game of the Main Street playset. Fun, and a good start to the con.<br/><br/><b>Baron Munchausen</b><br/><br/>It's somewhat of a tradition to play Baron Munchausen as an icebreaker at some UK conventions, and so we duly did at IndieCon.<br/><br/>We actually played a Victorian-themed hack of classic Munchausen - naturally, this being an English con, we couldn't play a game written by a damned foreigner - and so ~20 people gathered round to salute the Queen and tell tall tales of beating the crap out of the garlic-reeking French. Huzzah!<br/><br/><b>Sea Dracula</b><br/><br/>Check out the Sea Dracula baby, MC'd by me!<br/><br/>Haha, I can't believe this actually got off the ground. The gut feel to leave it 'til later once everyone was tanked was a sound one. Mad rapping skillz were unleashed, and the game saw ~20 odd people Riverdancing through the lower bars to the (be)amusement of other gamer folks who weren't playing. Mad props to everyone that danced, and congratulations to the winner, who walked off with a brand new copy of the D&amp;D Essentials boxed set.<br/><br/><b>Apocalypse World</b><br/><br/>A two-slotter of brutal violence, hate-inspired gore, and psychic rapefunkery in post-apocalyptic Pittsburgh. Kinda had a Mad Max style vibe - but with more gore.<br/><br/>I was keen to play AW again after an inconclusive run-out at Concrete Cow had left a greasy aftertaste in my mouth - this really was more of the same relentlessly violent and grim fodder (that I contributed to). <br/><br/>I did have a good game for 90% of the session, but I think we were all running out of steam come the end, and - IMO - the last part devolved into a progression of scene after scene after scene of "kill them and take their stuff" that I just had to bail on. <br/><br/>The session was valuable in that it got me to make my mind up about AW: the AW system is golden, and I now know that I have zero interest in the default post-apocalyptic setting.<br/><br/><b>Dogs in the Vineyard x3</b><br/><br/>I ran three slots of Dogs on demand, all with the same Town, different players, and markedly different judgements. This was the first time that I'd played such a rapid succession of Dogs games all set in the same Town, and it was real innerestin' to see how different each game played even given the same starting situation. Tick good.<br/><br/><b>Don't Rest Your Cape</b><br/><br/>This was a playtest of Toad's Don't Rest Your Head superheroes hack, and Ash, Jez, and Mike Harnish duly stepped up and brought the cool. It was fun, Watchmen-style. We had a chat about the game after the game - I always like that - and I do hope Toad carries on with this. Tick good.<br/><br/><b>The Marquis of Ferrara (Mist Robed Gate)</b><br/><br/>Or rather, a hack of it set in Renaissance Italy featuring courtly intrigue and backstabbing Papists.<br/><br/>The MRG system for conflict resolution - the winner is determined by a secret ballot of the other players - is super cool. This is not fully-baked, but I do hope Rich pops it into his Game Baking Oven until it is Golden Browned Goodness.<br/><br/><b>Final Thoughts</b><br/><br/>Come to IndieCon, it's got a great vibe.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299974/#Comment_299974" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T05:03:38+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  5:03AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Envy envy envy envy...

Nothing much to add except the Shock: game was great and worthy of writeup.<br/><br/>I also played Skullduggery, set in the Cistine Chapel during the election of a new pope. This was an awful lot of fun. Much of the fun came from pontificating, declaiming, undermining and threatening each other - as it should do. But the GM (Declan Feeny) did a great job of ramping up external factors, which prevented the game ever  becoming an echo chamber of opinion. I spoke to Simon R after and he told me that this is the by-the-book approach to running it, which was great to know.<br/><br/>Simon's two-fisted pope slugged and shoved his way to victory, leaving a legacy of kittens (living and dead) in his path. Gratifyingly I led a mob of disenfranchised Romans to rip him to pieces in my deftly adopted role of "people's priest".

Even where the system seemed a bit off, the level of play overrode it. I played with new people in every game. There were no annoying players, and no players who did not contribute.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe chalets are spacious and decently furnished, and it was very good value, particularly as we bought and prepared our own food, avoiding the dubious pleasures of the on-site food. We had guests galore but did not seem to run out of comestibles. Rafu sampled the pleasure of the mince pie, but poor old Adam was a bit startled to have to serve his pasta to a proper Italian. I played with lots of non-Brits, which I really enjoyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of highlights:<br/>\n<br/>\nMontsegur 1244 was much, much better than I thought it would be and in this case led to excellent actual play. To add to what Steve and Frederik said, Mike(?) the other player, played a touching Amiel who went to the stake to save his sister though he could (by the system) have chosen to escape. He was dead set on burning until Steve's Roger put doubt in his mind. Garnier's epilogue hinged entirely on whether Bertrand would bless him. It did not happen, so he fled with Estralamonde(?) I don't know how player-sensitive the game is, as it so system light, but I have not heard complaints.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played Black Smoke, a setting for Skulduggery, where we were all vying to be Pope. It was very good - the characters are generated from a background plus a random assortment of personality traits, so I ended up with a forthright Irish Cardinal whose Rebuff was Obfuscatory, and sin was Wrath, so I channelled Father Jack from Father Ted with a little more eloquence. He was made Pope for about five minutes before Alex F's Italian Cardinal whipped up the crowd and had him torn to pieces. No one had any problems coming up with dialog, and I think this demonstrates the Skulduggery makes the Dying Earth system attractive for play without intimidating players into refusing to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300491/#Comment_300491" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-11T21:06:44+00:00" title="November 11, 2010  9:06PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, it was good.

I always forget just how al dente proper pasta is eaten.<br/><br/>Indiecon was bloody great.<br/><br/>It started with Hell 4 Leather which didn't work for me at all, for various reasons which I think were largely unrelated to the system and mostly related combining too much wine and too little sleep.   The next morning was Steve's table of Shock which was great.  I really got dnto the story of my poet whose wife had become an AI, thanks to some aggressive and nasty antagonism from Daniel.  In the afternoon I went to play A Taste For Murder which was served with cucumber sandwiches, scones, jam, little cakes and tea.  Luckily, I was permitted to drink coffee.  My Rose the Maid ended up annoyingly zero-dimensional as I didn't create enough character other than "is the maid".  I did get to have fun in the second act, refusing to maid any more once my status as daughter of the house was revealed, and pursuing a relationship with a shocked and terrified uncle.   We finished off with an evening of AW and I got play the Hocus.  The game worked better than my attempt at Gaelcon, and although I lacked screen-time I really liked Always.  I'm hoping Daniel creates a thread about this one.<br/><br/>The next day I organised a game of Remember Tomorrow and had fun switching characters.   In the evening I got dragged into a game of Montsegur 1244 which is as good as everyone has been saying.  I've been musing about Pierre Roget all week.<br/><br/>At this point, I'd been roleplaying for about twenty-four hours which is about all I can manage.   It was great to see everybody, and I'm looking forward to next year already.<br/><br/>Adam.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish" title="MJ Harnish"><img alt="MJ Harnish" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish">MJ Harnish</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300664/#Comment_300664" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-13T02:52:08+00:00" title="November 13, 2010  2:52AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I will echo what others have said. I played in 7 excellent sessions, 4 of which were flat out awesome. I've been slowly writing about my experiences on my blog.<br/><br/>A couple bits to note: <br/><br/>Graham's Stan Fish was fabulous and everyone else was so in sync with the Fiasco playset that the whole thing was fun from start to finish.  <br/><br/>AW was also a ton of fun and I really liked Daniel worked hard to incorporate the group's suggestions in to the fiction. Wicked Pig snacks are disgusting though...in a tasty way. <br/><br/>Simon always brings the awesome to the table - he was a ton of fun to play Little Fears last year and this year both Montsegur and Skulduggery were just as much fun. I ended up playing an obese French con man in Skulduggery who bet on the Irish pope only to see him torn to pieces 5 minutes after addressing the crowd.<br/><br/>Montsegur 1244 was so great that I went out and bought it as soon as our session ended. Frederik's "the grail was a hoax" reveal gutted me b/c it meant Raymond's sacrifice was for nothing....that was a very powerful moment for me. My poor little boy getting burned at the stake to see his sister escape was just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>Don't rest your cape was very cool - we were some pretty wacked out super "heroes". <br/><br/>My Kidz playtest also was great - all the players bought in quickly and the end story was very satisfying. The fact that I got to play a comic store owner who compared the 4 kids to the Fantastic Four and then handed one of them a LARP axe as a weapon was too much fun.<br/><br/>The food was decent, the chalets were very nice, the beer was great, and best of all the people were all universally friendly and there to have fun made it a perfect con IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300666/#Comment_300666" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-13T03:15:21+00:00" title="November 13, 2010  3:15AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Should have been there, too.
