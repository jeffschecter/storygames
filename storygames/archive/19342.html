For me, my most successful game was one that went three whole scenes and lasted for almost two weeks before going moribund.<br/> <br/>I moved on to play-by-voice games, which is mostly what I do now, and I spent a good long while playing those, and absorbing a lot of game design theory along the way. When I went back and looked into play-by-post games recently I was sort of hoping that someone would have solved the problems that I experienced when I was playing them back in 2003-2004.<br/> <br/>But it looks like nobody has.<br/> <br/>A quick scan through every play-by-post I've been able to find will show that nearly all games die early, and with almost nothing getting done. Most stall within the first scene if they ever manage to start at all. Many of them die before people even manage to introduce their characters.<br/> <br/>Anyone have any idea why this happens? I mean, people clearly WANT this to work, those forums stacked with endless piles of dead games are full of people constantly trying to make this work.<br/> <br/>To the people who have made this kind of thing work, do you have any idea why your game survived when the vast majority of others fail so quickly?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430699/#Comment_430699" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T16:46:02+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  4:46PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bookmarking this right away.

I have to admit I do not really play there anymore, but I can say it worked for years.<br/>The players had similar rythms in their life. That worked for them to post at similar times and commit to a similar rythm. We had slow going games and ones with multiple posts each day. Both worked with the players being happy with the same commitment.<br/>They need to stay at the game for a long time too, can be month and years till a scenario is finished. The players should know that.<br/><br/>But on the other hand not too many scenes will be done so the scenario should be somewhat short. Something you can do in one session I would suggest.<br/><br/>Starting somewhat in medias res is a good thing or starting with the characters together at least, maybe getting to know each other right then. Individual starts for each character have been the bane of my failing scenarios.<br/><br/>You should be willing to get new players into the game and have some leave. If after a few month one player has to get out that should not fail the game for everyone. So not hinging the whole scenario on a certain constallation of players is bad. If you need the same characters that is fine, but have other players take them over or if you are a GM be willing to run them as NPCs if you do not find a replacement. Also if you are willing to bring in new characters and take out old ones, you should not run a scenario that seperates necessary information.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430702/#Comment_430702" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T16:56:39+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  4:56PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2014 4:57PM by AsIf.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Biest">@Biest</a> - This seems to suggest that certain types of Settings are more fitting for PBF than others, yes?

Was it perfect? No, but I think the framework I set up at the beginning has more or less worked out OK. <br/><br/>Key features: <br/>- a rigid scene structure<br/>- a GM willing to say 'it's time for the next scene'<br/>- posting deadlines. Flexible if need be, but they're there. <br/>- a posting model. At the beginning I outlined the 'ideal' scene: establishing shot, PC 1 asks (N)PC 2 for something, other character says yes/no, done. Of course, we almost never did so few exchanges, but more than 4 or 5 posts and it's too long. <br/>In PBP you've got the time to think and then load a single post with a lot of important stuff - posting a single line doesn't speed up the process. <br/><br/>Biest is right to point out that the scenario should be short. A lot of time can pass in the story, but the number of discrete 'things' that can happen is necessarily lower. <br/>In our game each episode had 11 scenes - and our series finale is... episode 5. We still got a lot done, though. <br/><br/>There's an RPG.net thread on the subject of system that might be useful: <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?704702-What-Would-the-Ideal-Play-by-Post-RPG-System-Look-Like" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?704702-What-Would-the-Ideal-Play-by-Post-RPG-System-Look-Like</a><br/><br/>One thing I got out of that thread was the idea that a player should be able to declare and resolve their action in a single post if possible. <br/>I never quite managed that with my game, but we got closer to it, and I have plans for next time.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430705/#Comment_430705" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T17:44:02+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  5:44PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Orklord about the conflict resolution mechanics. Those do help a great deal, even if the forum, <a href="www.aves-reich.de" rel="nofollow">www.aves-reich.de</a> for those reading german, I played in.<br/><br/>I also strongly agree on the community aspect and the communication.<br/>The forum has it's own chat and off topic area, for players to mingle and talk. So that gets a sense of community going and makes it easier to get to know each other but also to ask for posts and the reasons for not posting.<br/>We gave each of the big scenarios their own subforum. With it's own threads set up by the GM almost everyone had a general offtopic and out of character thread and private threads between the GM and players. So everything could be asked and answered outside the main thread. Many organised their scenarios by giving each scene or chapter a new threat. Which also allows to do some inter personal scenes while the main plot is going on allready. Also easier reading when you want to look back.<br/>A more open scenario did not divide by a timeline or dramaturgy but just had different threads for the different places in the setting.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430706/#Comment_430706" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T17:46:19+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  5:46PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you read this thread:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19334/play-by-forum#Item_20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19334/play-by-forum#Item_20</a><br/><br/>Since my post there is short, I will re-post here:\n<blockquote>I am playing in an OD&amp;D game (been playing for almost 6 years now) and running an OD&amp;D game (for almost a year) on the OD&amp;D boards:<br/><br/>The game I am running (which could be open to one or two players):<br/><br/><a href="http://odd74.proboards.com/board/96/franks-wilderlands-csio-od" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://odd74.proboards.com/board/96/franks-wilderlands-csio-od</a><br/><br/>And the game I am playing in:<br/><br/><a href="http://odd74.proboards.com/board/54/makofan-online-od" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://odd74.proboards.com/board/54/makofan-online-od</a><br/><br/>Pace is definitely slow (and my game has almost been derailed by the arrival of a new baby).<br/></blockquote>\nHmm, I'm not sure any of orklord's suggestions have been applied.<br/><br/>Coalhada, definitely the GM moving action along by calling the next scene HAS been useful.<br/><br/>Otherwise, go look at the forum.

There's too much data.<br/><br/>It's like saying "read my novel to understand how English grammar works." It might help, but the information is not in a digestible format.<br/><br/>Part of my issue with fixing the problems that I've observed while playing this kind of game, is that failed games often resist analysis. It's difficult, often impossible, to determine what you did wrong because of the WAY that these games die. <br/><br/>If a tabletop game self destructs, you all sit back from the table and then you say "Jee, that really sucked, lets not do [REASON_FOR_FAILURE] again."<br/><br/>But when play-by-post games fail, there can be no analysis, because the <i>way</i> that they fail is that everyone just... stops talking. Information can typically be gathered only by archaeology, by digging through the threads, which is, I've found, an inefficient method for acquiring usable procedures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430713/#Comment_430713" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T21:09:23+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  9:09PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just going to say, that Storium does a great job of encouraging spotlight sharing, of encouraging good scene pacing (by giving everybody an indicator for how close the scene is to done), as well as giving the GM a bunch of tools to work with.<br/><br/>You should really give it a whirl.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430715/#Comment_430715" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T21:58:50+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  9:58PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough.<br/><br/>I think what has kept makofan's game going for more than 6 years is that a handful of players are dedicated, but patient. We have other things going on in our life that makes us not desperate for the game, but find it enjoyable.<br/><br/>As to techniques that help, most definitely the GM is willing to move the action along even if there hasn't been much response. Everyone who plays accepts that if they don't post reasonably promptly, the action will move along. I'm still working out when to do so in the game I am running, but we seem to have started rolling again after several weeks of no action.<br/><br/>Makofan and I are each "caller" in the other's game with a player responsibility and authority to help move things along, and that helps.<br/><br/>Certainly the relatively simple combat system of OD&amp;D also helps. In fact, the generally simple OD&amp;D characters also help.<br/><br/>I was afraid a near TPK would torpedo the game, but everyone asked for me to roll them a new set of attributes. Maybe the high stakes nature of OD&amp;D actually drives interest. Thinking back to when I started playing in 1977, I think that was a factor. It's sort of like learning a video game, at first you run through lives, but slowly you learn the environment and get more and more sustainability. That supplies an incentive to come back and try again, and see what happens next.<br/><br/>Ultimately I guess what really keeps it going is two dedicated players plus a GM willing to trust that action will encourage the less dedicated players to contribute enough to keep the game from getting stale.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430717/#Comment_430717" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T23:04:38+00:00" title="April  8, 2014 11:04PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jack">@Jack</a> the Quick - I don't expect you to read through hundreds of posts from my past games.

I've done some post mortems on failed games and had conversations with players after they dropped out of games I was running.<br/><br/>A few reasons I've found:<br/>* Life/work schedule changed for an ongoing period (got new job, stress at home, moving, etc.)<br/>* life/work schedules change for a brief period (vacation, got sick, travel) and return to the game is a post debt, leading to the player falling behind and not catching up or unable to re-engage<br/>* Player post rate heavily out of sync with the playgroup (posting too fast and becoming frustrated with the rest of the group, posting too slow and falling behind)<br/>* Players not "doing enough", meaning their posts are introspective without moving the fiction forward. I've seen games stall out because players were busy posing and angsting without do-ing<br/>* A playgroup has wildly different expectations out of the game/setting and the slow pace of conversation stalls out, leaving it unresolved                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20the%20Quick" title="Jack the Quick"><img alt="Jack the Quick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20the%20Quick">Jack the Quick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430724/#Comment_430724" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T04:28:32+00:00" title="April  9, 2014  4:28AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh! That IS an interesting one there orklord. The concept of post-debt.<br/><br/>The feeling that the longer one has been away, the more work one has to catch up on, leading to more avoidance.<br/><br/>I've noticed this trend with other things in my life, and it is a dangerous cycle if one wants to get anything done. <br/><br/>Your last point in your second post is also important. I've often thought that the reason that play-by-post games often go badly, is that it is so difficult to do a conversation through asynchronous text. <br/><br/>Games are conversation, and in a live conversation we're constantly aware of the general emotional state of the other people we're playing with, but over an asynchronous medium like a forum, we don't have that connection.<br/><br/>I can't tell, if what I'm doing is boring, or annoying, or confusing you, while I can tell that instantly in person. Due to the lag between communications, asking people to change something they've already posted (because it's going in a direction you don't like, or contains incorrect information about something that you created) is a significant burden, and people are less likely to make on-the-fly adjustments to the shared fiction as a result.<br/><br/>This is aggravated by the medium of forums, as the conversation that generates the fiction also becomes the -record- of that fiction, and so things are 'set in stone' far more then they tend to be in a real-time game.<br/><br/>Often, when playing in real-time, I'll find myself in conversations like this:<br/><br/>"OK! So I go light the torch and -<br/><br/>"Wait! Wasn't the torch already lit? I mean, Torvald was waving it at those zombies."<br/><br/>"But isn't it really dark in here? We have an aspect <i>Deadly Shadows</i>."<br/><br/>"Right, yes, ok, lets say that it went out when Torvald fell down and you just re-lit it"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whereas in a play-by-post game, this kind of continuity editing is very difficult or impossible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430727/#Comment_430727" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T05:33:18+00:00" title="April  9, 2014  5:33AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jack, my experience isn't the same as yours.

Occasionally a game doesn't gain the traction to get started, but I shrug and move on to the next one that does.

Something is right about that game...<br/><br/>Of course that game is using a system that actually is very amendable to play by post. Relatively simple mechanics that are amendable to the GM rolling all the dice (that's a key point I didn't mention earlier - that allows the GM to resolve an action once it's been stated, so if a player initiates an action and then doesn't respond for several days, the action still gets resolved). The simple combat system is also amenable to the GM just cycling a few rounds without player input (as I did in the most recent combat I ran, and as makofan has done a few times with combats that lasted more than a few rounds).<br/><br/>And that circles back to the most important element I think, trust. The players trust the GM to keep things moving and the GM trusts that at least a couple players are dedicated and will eventually post again even if they get distracted in the short term by the rest of their life.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430744/#Comment_430744" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T11:18:39+00:00" title="April  9, 2014 11:18AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ffilz: If a game is still fun and going strong, by all means keep going.

In other words, the fun of the game is inhabiting your favorite Harry Potter/Twilight/Dragonball Z/X-Men character, and there's no difference between a boring post in which you do nothing but chitchat and an exciting post where you enter or resolve a major conflict.  You get the same payoff both ways since there's no mechanics. Normally there's no GM so there's nobody to force any issues. I don't think one XP per post would alter this dynamic.  Instead, a challenge or conflict resolution system that rewards you (somehow) for handling conflicts and so on would help. But I should note that changing the character you are playing in significant ways is not valued by this crowd - instead, total dedication to your ("correct") vision of the character is. So normal things like levelling up or changing even in emotional ways are not really on the table in most cases.  This is a little insane given that the source material for most PbPs is simplistic and the conflicts are very direct.

In the places where I played PBP games (the Megatokyo comic forums mostly, and RPOL), it was common to have a game master, though they often also had a PC character. <br/><br/>I think PBP communities diverge <i>wildly</i> from each other in terms of culture and expectations.<br/><br/>I remember reading an article or thread about early dungeons and dragons, and how 'the game' of D&amp;D played by any specific group of people was a sort of cargo-cult amalgamation of the various books, magazines, home-brew, and whatever else was available at the time.<br/><br/>The "PBP Scene", if one can even call it that, is the same. There are a <i>massive</i> variety of different Play-By-Post cultures, and they are all <i>very</i> different.<br/><br/>For instance, I played mostly on comic forums. These forums contained a lot of people with a wide variety of interests, almost all of whom had no tabletop RPG experience.<br/><br/>Games were created by one person, and took place mostly in a single forum thread. The number of players differed, but usually started with between three and six. <br/><br/>The GM typically held authority over the world, but not over the narrative, each player having absolute mastery over their own character. Most of these games never went anywhere, often fizzling out after one or two posts by the players.<br/><br/>The post format flip-flopped between first and third person, with various game masters attempting to apply one standard or another, but they were almost all written like media, not like a conversation, and were typically written in past-tense.<br/><br/>One would write:\n<blockquote>"Jim walked over to the table and picked up the gun, looking at it carefully."</blockquote>\nOr:\n<blockquote>"I walked over to the table and picked up the gun. I peer carefully at it."</blockquote>\nNever:\n<blockquote>"I walk over to the table and pick up the gun. What does it look like? I'm trying to figure out if this is the same gun we found earlier on the floor in the lobby."</blockquote>\nThe last example is interesting because that's the kind of dialog I expect in tabletop games, but I never even considered using it in PBP. I only realized it was even an option when when looking at OrcLords monsterhearts game. Many of the posts in that game look like <i>conversation, </i>talking <i>about</i> the game, and not AS the game.<br/><br/>That seems to be a missing piece of technology, along with having a dedicated game master to drive things forward.<br/><br/><br/>I also noticed that all the successful games that have been posted so far have had multiple threads, often -dozens- of threads, while my experience had the entire game contained in a single thread. Has anyone done both? Is there a reason multi-thread games appear to work better or do you think that is just a small sample size skewing the results?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430792/#Comment_430792" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-10T07:07:58+00:00" title="April 10, 2014  7:07AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2014 5:40PM by orklord.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is some really cool stuff, <a href="/forums/profile/Jack">@Jack</a> the Quick!<br/><br/>Yes, the convention, or style, of talking "about the game" sort of like a player slipping in and out of portraying the character, is a method that Michael Loy does with amazing success.

But it helps me keep my frame of reference, it makes it easier for my to go back and re-read certain scenes, I can more easily keep track of how many scenes each player has had in a given session (again, I need/use sessions because of the session end moves of Apocalypse World and Monsterhearts, but I also like it because it mimics TV episodes or chapters of a book).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430813/#Comment_430813" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-10T09:55:48+00:00" title="April 10, 2014  9:55AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done both single-thread and multiple thread and, for me, it totally depends on the site.

Most of it in my case has been freeform and GMless, though I don't think adding a light systems like *W would change the experience significantly.<br/><br/>The most useful thing for running a PBP in my experience is an out of character chat that runs at a much faster rate than the game itself, ideally with some means of saving a history so those people who miss conversations can still read up on them. This lets you hone down to the experience that you actually want to get "on screen", whilst also giving you a meta game that spreads a lot wider than it likely would in a tabletop game where you can try ideas on for size before committing to them. Talking in advance about how to frame the next scene, or being able to tell you during the game that I'm okay for you to post that my character follows your out the door rather than having to write something separate to that effect, speeds things up a lot and avoids burnout from writing loads of words about pointless things.<br/><br/>In my experience, a single thread game works best for something that has a fairly traditional "one epic journey undertaken by an adventuring party who mostly stick together" format. As long as everyone's posting at a fairly equal rate, it gives everyone a chance to contribute and lets you easily keep on top of everything that's going on.<br/><br/>A multi-thread game by contrast is better for something with an open world and a less linear timeline. As long as players are careful with how they treat scenes that could have a large impact on their character - which they should generally know in advance because of the OOC chatter - you can run multiple scenes with the same character at once. This means active players can do more without keeping less active players away from the main story, and can lead to a feeling of an expansive, continuous world that's pretty much unique to PBP games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430939/#Comment_430939" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-14T06:57:10+00:00" title="April 14, 2014  6:57AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great breakdown of the merits of both single and multiple threads, <a href="/forums/profile/nerulean">@nerulean</a>!<br/><br/>QUESTION - one of the big factors I see affecting player attrition is what I've seen called "post debt".

It is no secret whatsoever that gamers love to tell you about their exploits, so for the slim price of being an invested 'listener' for a little while you can get a highlights reel very easily. <br/><br/>Generally though, it's fine as long as you've got a decent out-of-game atmosphere. If you know you're going to be away, you can do the team-player thing and write your character falling asleep or going off to scout for a bit to get them out of the way, or just ask people in slower threads if they're cool with putting the events on hold for a bit (and if the slow threads get culled afterwards because you don't feel like going back to them, no biggie as long as everyone feels like they've got a satisfactory understanding of how it would end). Likewise, if you come back, you should be able to trust your fellow players to cut you some slack if you haven't read every post in detail and get things wrong - if we're all adults, they'll correct the mistakes in good cheer and you'll accept the help with good grace and make edits.<br/><br/>In a bigger group, you might want a formalised policy for absences which is basically just writing out the above so everyone feels comfortable doing it. I personally like it when the out of character chatter is preserved somewhere so I can skim through to see if I missed any big community events or in-jokes, which is good for feeling part of things again after a while of being disconnected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430982/#Comment_430982" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-14T14:51:17+00:00" title="April 14, 2014  2:51PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So are we talking about play-by-post (e-mail, forum, or some other asynchronous "slow" venue) or by IRC or other "real-time" venue? There are definitely differences, with real-time you can ask lots of clarifying questions as long as people are relatively responsive. With asynchronous, "slow", you need to be prepared to make assumptions and just move forward.<br/><br/>As to the problem of post debt, poking my nose into the OD&amp;D IRC game that spawned from discussing Eero's playstyle, I definitely could not jump into that, way too much volume to read. But the play-by-post games that I'm involved in, the post volume is not more than 20-30 per week, and someone who missed a lot could just read the last few and probably get enough of an idea of the situation to contribute. If they make assumption that contradicts posts they didn't read, it's easy enough to correct if actually necessary.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430985/#Comment_430985" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-14T15:36:58+00:00" title="April 14, 2014  3:36PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frank, I don't really think you should let the "post debt" scare you off from the Greysands game.
