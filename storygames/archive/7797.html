Hmph. How...  elitist... and incorrect.<br/><br/>Let's see, just off the top of my head...<br/>* Soldiers pledge to defend the Constitution and country before ever having held a (GI) weapon, let alone firing it in conflict.<br/>* Doctors pledge not to harm and to always help before they've had anything other than animals and cadavers under their knives.<br/>* Lawyers pledge to uphold the law and... ah, some other shit (I forget) before they've tried one case.<br/>* Plenty of business proposals speak to "pledging" this and that, without even having a letterhead or a pot to piss in.<br/><br/>You're making a false declaration, pure and simple. That word you're using... I do not think it means what you think it means. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>But even if that were a valid point, the "others" of which you speak are Brennan and me, as far as the posts go--or did you mean to ward off others before the mealy-mouthing set in (was this a "moderator" post)? I've released, at last count, 14 games, most of which are CC licensed. Some are "betas" of sorts--the hipsters call 'em Ashcans nowadays--but I think it's safe to say I don't fit your "mealy-mouthed" category.

But yeah, looks like you are walking the walk. Sorry to mentally attribute that to you.</blockquote>\nCool man. No sweat.<br/><br/>I think the reason this topic has really gotten under my skin is because this is a really serious issue to me, and I've made some major (and perhaps economically foolish) decisions about the way I distribute my work based on my social beliefs. I think that a lot of these "games" are more important than anyone currently realizes, and I think it's important to preserve them and make them available to the guys like us who might be arriving in a year, two years, or a decade. For me, it's not so much about personal entitlement as much as it is about conservation of something I regard as an art form.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>With the caveat, "It will become readily available... but at whose expense?"

Has there ever been a game - or any creative work - made since the dawn of man for which this is true? If it is, then it's so alien from the rest of what humanity is doing that you probably would have a hard time building anything for it anyway. <br/><br/>2 - Your "express intent of sharing" what you have constructed for my game is also very strange, since I assume that because nobody could possibly use what you distribute without my game that people who might benefit from what you have created, including yourself, have already purchased my game. (Since you have positted that nobody can possibly benefit from what you have created without owning my game.)<br/><br/>So even if we assume your premises, no, nobody is hurt at all by my withdrawing my game from the market.  Your material is still as beneficial as it ever would have been, because everyone who could have possibly benefitted from your sharing already owns my game. There won't be any new people joining that group, but that doesn't hurt you, it just keeps your material from being useful to an eternally wider and wider audience. It keeps you where you are.<br/><br/>And that's assuming that my game is so strange, so alien that nothing you create for it can ever be valuable to anyone who doesn't own my game, which is a weird thing to assume and goes completely against the entire history of creative throught.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173346/#Comment_173346" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-05T12:50:43+00:00" title="October  5, 2008 12:50PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>(Since you have positted that nobody can possibly benefit from what you have created without owning my game.)</blockquote>\nOh, they possibly <i>could</i>.
