Maybe reducing the number of stat dice across the board and not permitting the players to use fallout to raise stats could work. Ultimately you want a system that stacks the deck against the characters over the long-term, which is something Dogs just doesn't do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61999/#Comment_61999" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T16:53:36+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  4:53PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm... good point, Eric -- I've certainly seen the characters improve quickly in Dogs -- anyone know if that's the case in Afraid as well?

I might try running this myself. D.A.G.O.N. too!<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hoog</cite>I don\\'t really agree with this</blockquote>\nWellllllllll... I'll just flesh out my argument, then!<br/><br/>"What just happened to you?" is the kicker, use it to start the first scene. You could technically rewrite it every time you take a break, even if its just to record what happened to you in the last scene. Putting your orders here doesn't specify a starting scene, and kinda prevents you from starting your character off <i>in media res</i> - it just gives you some vague idea of what's gonna happen in the scenario.<br/><br/>"What's your path?" is your motivation. Whenever you space out or come back from a break or get confused, you think "what do I do now?" and you look down at your character sheet and say "what's my motivation?"<br/><br/>And what you've got written down under "What's your path?" tells you. That's why you put your orders there.<br/><br/><br/>For example, my name is Special Agent Wilson, and I am an FBI agent, working for Delta Green.<br/><br/>What's the difference between these two pairs of answers:<br/><br/><b>1.</b><br/><br/><i>What are your orders?</i><br/><br/>Investigate Dale County, look for signs of those missing hikers, and any other suspicious activities.<br/><br/><i>What is your path?</i><br/><br/>To find my sister who was kidnapped by aliens.<br/><br/><br/><b>2.</b><br/><br/><i>What just happened to you?</i><br/><br/>I got punched in the face in the bathroom of a truck-stop diner.<br/><br/><i>What are your orders?</i><br/><br/>Investigate Dale County, look for signs of those missing hikers, and any other suspicious activities.<br/><br/><br/>The first one sounds like motivation for a long campaign (or several seasons of a tv series...), and the second one gives you adventure right now.<br/>Truck-stop diner, bathroom, go!<br/><br/>The reason I discount something like "What is your path? To find my sister..." is that it will just as easily show up in play - unless it comes up in the first adventure, you don't really need to figure it out right away.<br/><br/>The reason "What are your orders? Investigate Dale County..." can't replace "What just happened..." is because it doesn't put you in the truck-stop diner's bathroom.<br/><br/>And finally, the reason "What are your orders?" ties into the end is: because once you accomplish the objective, as stated in your orders, or find that impossible, the mission is over. That IS the end.<br/><br/><br/>So, there you go. If that doesn't convince you, I dunno what will.<br/>You could always try using all three, if you prefer that. When you get people to play, ask them what they think, before and after the game.<br/><br/>Hey, hope it goes well!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135089/#Comment_135089" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-16T08:58:02+00:00" title="March 16, 2008  8:58AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite>"What just happened to you?" is the kicker, use it to start the first scene. You could technically rewrite it every time you take a break, even if its just to record what happened to you in the last scene. Putting your orders here doesn't specify a starting scene, and kinda prevents you from starting your character off<i>in media res</i>- it just gives you some vague idea of what's gonna happen in the scenario.<br/></blockquote>I wasn't implying that you ditch "what's just happened to you?"<br/><br/>just that you add "what are your orders?"<br/><br/>so as to end up with "what are your orders and what's just happened to you?"<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite>"What's your path?" is your motivation. Whenever you space out or come back from a break or get confused, you think "what do I do now?" and you look down at your character sheet and say "what's my motivation?"<br/></blockquote>you're right<br/><br/>however, I think we both agree it's best if the orders are something vague<br/><br/>my example again: "find out what caused the electro-magnetic anomaly... we suspect the cult living in the nearby compound"<br/><br/>my idea is that this can only be used as a motivation, as a guiding principle, only for the first part of the adventure<br/><br/>at some point, the characters are going to discover that the cult is summoning Cthulhu, and that that's what's causing the EM anomaly<br/><br/>from then on, they'll want to stop the cult from summoning Cthulhu etc.<br/><br/>so from that point on, "what are your orders?" becomes useless<br/><br/>that's different from regular DRYH, where "what's your path?" applies right up to the end of the adventure                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
