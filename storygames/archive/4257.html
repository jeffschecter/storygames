I find myself thinking up cool ideas for games and being like, "Man, that would be <i>an awesome piece of cake</i> in TSOY."<br/><br/>Hip-hop meets Akira Kurosawa meets John Woo? TSOY (eventually I hope to put out a little for-free hack of this one)<br/>Cosmic steampunk? TSOY<br/>Star Trek: 1966? TSOY<br/><br/>It's so fiddley - I feel like I could literally do anything action adventure-y with it. The combination of Keys and BDTP are the peanut butter and jelly of an awesome action game. Also: CREATIVE COMMONS'ED.<br/><br/>Man, I don't know if threads like these are kosher here, but my love for TSOY cannot - nay - WILL NOT be contained.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95511/#Comment_95511" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T12:14:23+00:00" title="September 13, 2007 12:14PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a big fanboy, too.

Players can downshift from broad, conflict-y conflict to granular, task-y conflict in situations of supreme importance to their characters.  This is super important because it is the only way to permanently remove named NPCs, and because only players can do it - not the GM.  It's a very elegant and exciting way to handle situations the players care a lot about, and usually involves high stakes and permanent changes to the game.  Last night Steve entered Bringing Down the Pain against Colonel James Pettigrew, a southern cavalry officer who rides with Paul Revere's magic spurs (yeah, that's right fool, <i>Paul Revere's magic spurs.</i>)  And they fought, and Steve lost bad, and he ended up with a permanent spur-print in the side of his (invulnerable, super) character's face.  It was a big scene and Steve's guy, Harwood, was burning resources right and left to stay in the fight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95576/#Comment_95576" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T14:23:50+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  2:23PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2007 2:24PM by DevP.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm mostly ready to join in here, except I <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4258" rel="nofollow">have a few questions</a>, and want to play it a few more times (or GM it) before commiting to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95578/#Comment_95578" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T14:26:49+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  2:26PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Consonant Dude</cite>TSoY is a great game.

As I mention above, nothing will derail a 3rd-party project quite like having the entire core system changed up part way through the development process. Likewise, designers seem to have a long memory when things like this happen. If anybody was developing a project for TSOY 1e and had this happen, I suspect that they won't risk having it happen a second time (however unlikely it may be).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95757/#Comment_95757" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T21:32:43+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  9:32PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eh, I donno.

When a new edition comes out, your potential target audience well all but dries up completely unless you're willing to make the leap to the new edition, as well. Look at the TSOY players on this thread. They're all talking about the 2nd Edition of the game. Oddly, publishers don't like burning money for fun.

Early 2005, the above criticism would stick.  But once the 2005 "Real Edition" came out, the author basically stated, "This is the edition that works. The previous one? ...my bad." In the 2.5+ years since, it hasn't changed at all. Not even so much as a codified house rule. The new edition isn't changing unless that change comes from someone else doing something new with it.

Again, because of the license anyone who works with the system <b>will have to make their game available for free</b> as well.

Principia is really my take on TSOY more than a TSOY hack, though you can easily take Principia stuff straight back to TSOY. Keys work a bit differently, plus there's a new layer added on in the War of Ideas. The cultures in Principia are stuff like Alchemy, Astrology, Ancient Church (analagous to the Catholic Church), Nobility, and so on. They're a little bit crunchier than cultures in TSOY, having a layer of master secrets that give players a measure of narrative control over what can be done in the world. Principia also has a sort of scene economy.\n<blockquote><br/>Do you have a list of the Secrets and Keys from the retro-modern planet-hopping pulp setting you could share. (On the web or via email?)

I am lazy (or busy), and it is hard to extract that stuff right.<br/><br/>No one's mentioned the dual-coverness of the Fudge edition. The rules are the same, with one example that was broken being fixed. I changed the covers after one of the players I most respect told me that the cover was commercially unviable.

But what I'm thinking is, much like the Keywords in <i>HeroQuest</i>, one can make up groups of Abilities, Secrets and Keys to reflect a setting.<br/><br/>But it seems to me that the Keys are just sort of perfect as they are for adventure storytelling.  If I were doing a John Carter-like setting I'd definitely change out the Abilities.  But the secrets?  Maybe I'd add a few, but I'd probably leave a lot of them the same.  Same for a <i>Traveller</i>-like setting.<br/><br/>What do you think?<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>TSOY: The Perfect Game - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4257/tsoy-the-perfect-game/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="TSOY: The Perfect Game - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4257/tsoy-the-perfect-game/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Yep, that's what we did, Chris.

I think it was also a +2 weapon when dive-tackling someone.<br/><br/>Brandon used Uptembo for his character's staff-based martial art and we ended up incorporating Zu (unchanged) into our setting because it was such a good fit. I think it was based on ancient Atlantean writing.<br/><br/>The bottom line for us: It was all incredibly easy. We didn't do a conversion or anything like that.

I don't have time, but here's what you do:<br/><br/>- Change the pools. *Definitely* change the pools. They define your setting.<br/>- Ah, the abilities. Only change ones that obviously don't fit. I thought about those more than you'd think.<br/>- Secrets. Secrets are my sacred cow, and one I should have killed. I'm glad I didn't - I love 'em - but they're not that useful. A handful of them do everything. Use Secret of Imbuement for almost everything, and the Secrets of Blessing, Enhancement, and Specialty for everything else. The species secrets are cool for color - maybe add those in to whatever setting you have.<br/>- Keys are easily mixed between the core keys and ones you need for your setting.

Weird. Now that you say it, it seems so obvious.</blockquote>\nThat's strange.  It was the first thing that occurred to me, but also seemed like the hardest.  Keys and Secrets both have a lot of guidelines in the book as far as making up new ones goes.

Early 2005, the above criticism would stick. But once the 2005 "Real Edition" came out, the author basically stated, "This is the edition that works. The previous one? ...my bad." In the 2.5+ years since, it hasn't changed at all. Not even so much as a codified house rule. The new edition isn't changing unless that change comes from someone else doing something new with it. The core "Solar System" rules aren't going anywhere.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nWell, again, past history and long memories. In a world where this same promise has been made and broken numerous times by numerous parties, it doesn't mean much. I mean, I think it's great that you have that much faith in Clinton, though I suspect that many publishers (or potential publishers) don't. Look at all the parties who got hung out to dry with the recent D&amp;D; 4.0 announcement, for example (or the preceding 3.5 announcement).<br/>\n<br/>\nMany folks whom I know are very guarded when it comes to investing a lot of time or money in a system that is, despite promises, subject to have its creator support disappear at any given time. Which is to say <i>any</i> RPG system. If it has already happened once, the likelihood that it will happen again is statistically more likely. And that's not lost on a lot of people who are designing games for a living.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe recent decision of Green Ronin to publish the Pirate's Guide to Freeport as a system-independent product came about, for example, according to interviews, as a direct result of a new D&amp;D; edition being suspected. Perhaps Mr. Pramas can discuss this in more detail, though I gather (having listened to said interviews) that this decision came about largely due to past experience (notably, getting hung out to dry a bit when D&amp;D; 3.5 was announced without any forewarning).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to summarize, third-party support doesn't happen in a vaccuum and past history does (and should do) a lot to inform the decisions of third-party publishers who want to stay in business. While it's unfortunate that one can't trust a proprietary IP holder to honestly represent a timeline for planned new editions, it's pretty much expected that they won't. And in fairness, it wouldn't make much sense for them (the proprietary IP holder) to do so, given the negative trickle down effect that the resulting stall in third-party support would have on proprietary system sales.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96462/#Comment_96462" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T00:57:54+00:00" title="September 16, 2007 12:57AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Well, with TSOY any "commercial publisher" looking to come along and write their own TSOY-based game will be hard-pressed.

Here's my quick answer that I haven't thought completely through: if you want to talk more about it, let's start a new thread, here or on my forum at the Forge.<br/><br/>Pools are what make up a person in the game. They are prerequisites for person-hood. In TSOY, without Vigor, Instinct, and Reason, you are not a person. This holds for adventure swords and sorcery, but what about other settings? I could see a game of TSOY set in, say, the Crusades, that used God, Man, and the Devil as pools. Or, a fairly hard sci-fi game with Vision, Craft, and Intuition as pools.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure more pools won't work. Two might work pretty well, though - but I haven't tried it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96800/#Comment_96800" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T03:50:10+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  3:50AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite>Ah, I didn't bother to check and see if the CC license was a non-commerical one.<em>This</em>would explain the lack of third-party publisher support.

The basic Solar System and even parts of the setting are licensed under CC-licenses that are still share-alike but allow commercial use.<br/><br/>That said, I think the two big reasons for a "lack" of commercial third party support are: (1) The commercially usable versions are hard to find, so most people think its only availabe for non-commercial use and (2) many people balk at the idea of using something licensed as Share Alike, thus making their work available in an open format/under an open license, because that would mean that other people could "steal their work" or something. (That making something open can actually be a good thing is something that's often forgotten, though.) <br/><br/>Personally, I disagree, even though I can see where they are coming from. But I think it's defenitly a factor in people using TSOY/Solar System for their own games.<br/><br/>(Interesting side-node I just realized: Maybe I'm misssing a few CC-licensed games, but I think Wushu is actually one of the most supported CC-games, what with two commercial spinoffs and a whole bunch of non-commercial stuff.
