Dice tales aren't usually helpful...<br/><br/><b>Does anyone have gaming questionaire questions that really help get an idea of who a gamer is / what they like before meeting them in person?  </b><br/><br/>(I know people can lie, obviously, but let's assume people are being honest).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244281/#Comment_244281" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-30T14:29:31+00:00" title="November 30, 2009  2:29PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How 'bout:<br/><br/>What are three things that could happen at the table to make an awesome gaming session?<br/><br/>What do you hope to experience through role-playing games?<br/><br/>What do you want to avoid in the games that you play?<br/><br/><br/>(and here are the two that i just handed out to folks whom i'm attempting to start a group with)<br/>1. what do you like about stories?<br/>2. why do you think you'll like playing story-games?<br/><br/>or, perhaps better:<br/><br/>1. what kinds of stories do you like?<br/>2. you are imagining a fun activity when i use the phrase "story-game". describe that activity for me.<br/><br/>(i think clarifying &amp; gettin on the same page... or, the "game page", if you will- is hella vital.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244294/#Comment_244294" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-30T16:38:25+00:00" title="November 30, 2009  4:38PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an impractical answer for the given question, but the best measure I have to is to get the opinion of someone who's already played with them.  In other words, forget their resume, just get their references.<br/><br/>That's actually how most of the new people who have joined our group over the years have come in -- they played with someone else in the group, who decided "Hey, this person would fit in great with our weekly game."  (Well, okay, they played with the one guy in our group who goes to cons and local gaming organizations and the like; but he's a good judge of character, so when he says someone is cool, they're cool.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
