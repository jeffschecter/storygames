There's an interesting bit about why SotC is being so heavily hacked. Fred opines in part that (by comparison to C:tL) it's hackable because it's not completely "finished". He attributes the thought and term to a quote from Ross about Risus. It's an interesting question.<br/><br/>What factors do you think enhances a game's hackability?<br/><br/>Maybe looking at what games are frequently hacked would be useful: DitV, TSoY, SotC, Risus, d20 (?).

One traditional way to do it is to have parts of the game world that are never given mechanics (there's this ancient vampire clan, but we're not going to publish official rules for them).  Another is to leave holes in the setting and mechanics for players to fill in (tales are told of the far western lands, where people breathe fire).  Another is to have guidelines that allow players to create their own setting elements and give mechanical weight to them.  Another is to create a general genre-specific set of mechanics, but allow groups to layer different color on top of it (I'm thinking about <i>My Life With Master</i> and <i>The Mountain Witch</i> here, which don't have setting in a traditional fashion).  So, yeah, lots of options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108837/#Comment_108837" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T09:10:07+00:00" title="November 19, 2007  9:10AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Russell Collins</cite>TSoY was one of the first games I wanted to completely hack.

Why do people do so much hacking of DitV as opposed to, say, Polaris or MLwM (picking two random games of roughly the same time period with roughly the same level of consumer awareness).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108864/#Comment_108864" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T11:26:55+00:00" title="November 19, 2007 11:26AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After Gen Con 2005, Ron drew up a diagram of various narrativist roleplaying games with interconnecting arrows, and circulated it a bit among some of the designers whose games appeared on it. After Gen Con 2006 he updated it somewhat. It's an ontology, albeit one without much general public value, as the arrows between the boxes lack descriptors that would tell what relationship is being indicated. You have to intuit the relationships from knowing the games and knowing how Ron thinks about them.<br/><br/>But an observation I've heard made about the diagram is that the games on the left branch tend to inspire being hacked for different settings (Sorcerer, DitV, TSoY, Riddle of Steel, etc.), and the games on the right branch tend to inspire designers to adapt their mechanical concepts into designs for new games (MLwM, PtA, Universalis, Capes, etc.). From what I recall of the diagram, this was a pretty accurate observation. But what I'm not remembering is Ron's underlying organizational principle behind the first fork in the ontology. It may have had something to do with the distribution of traditional GM authority. Which is rather interesting to consider. Is hacking, in the traditional sense, an extension of traditional GM responsibilities?<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108865/#Comment_108865" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T11:35:53+00:00" title="November 19, 2007 11:35AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite> It may have had something to do with the distribution of traditional GM authority.

To paraphrase Steve Jackson, systems are sets of rules that one uses to do things and games are things that you do. <br/><br/>A game is self-contained and, thus, <i>must</i> have a built-in premise and defined goal set. Many things marketed as games are, in fact,.<i>systems</i> (or, unfinished games, if you like). SotC is a good example. It's a system. Part of a game. In order for one to <i>play</i> SotC, however, you need to add a premise and goal set of your own design, thus turning it into a game. <br/><br/>The thing that makes systems more hackable than games is that, out of the box, systems are more widely applicable to different situations and premises rather than being confined to one specific situation or premise. It's the difference between, say, Burning Wheel (a system) and The Mountain Witch (a game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108923/#Comment_108923" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T21:58:25+00:00" title="November 19, 2007  9:58PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All systems are hackable.<br/><br/>Whether or not they will be *treated* and *perceived* as hackable depends largely on the community that grows up around the game.<br/><br/>Fate co-opted the Fudge community in large part, and the Fudge community is built around a game that has been defined from the get-go as very hackable: in fact, that's the point.<br/><br/>But there are other factors going into it.  Creators can:<br/><br/>- Put obvious flags into their game showing where it's hackable<br/><br/>- Explain why their game is built the way it is so the reader who wishes to hack the game can proceed with confidence that he understands the effects his hack will have on the system<br/><br/>- Respond to proposed hacks on message boards in a way that says "Hey, you've done a cool thing with my game, rock out, here are some more ideas for what you can do with it"<br/><br/>- Etc<br/><br/>All of this ultimately though is about creating the culture around your game.  Is the culture one where the creator and/or system are held to be an authority, or a collaborator?  <br/><br/>Hacks arise from collaboration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

I've seen (and done) a lot of D&amp;D hacking in my time -- when I started playing D&amp;D back in the early 80s it was the only game in town. If you wanted to play, say, a sci-fi game or a western game you <i>could</i> go out and buy one, but getting your group to play it was by no means assured.

Maybe the game you're most likely to hack is the game you're familiar with, the game you keep going back to, the game you want to keep playing so much that you're willing to <i>turn it into another game</i> in order to do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109003/#Comment_109003" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T10:53:32+00:00" title="November 20, 2007 10:53AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.

That makes it attractive to the prospective system hacker that doesn't want to hack something with the depth of crunch as, say, d20.  Though, I think this also lends itself more to setting hacking rather than mechanical hacking.<br/><br/>(b) DitV has captured the hearts of a lot of people.  I know several folks, including myself, who can say that DitV was their first "not-traditional" game (for whatever that label's worth).  There's an emotional investment there.<br/><br/>Our group is about to start a short DitV setting hack based on Stephen King's Dark Tower series:  Gunslingers in the Vineyard.  The GM for this game felt utterly inspired to run this after playing, I think, his second DitV game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109024/#Comment_109024" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T13:04:13+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  1:04PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>ubiquity and familiarity</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I like to call this "fashion."</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109028/#Comment_109028" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T16:11:44+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  4:11PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What factors do you think enhances a game's hackability?<br/></blockquote>\nSystems that are extensible in hierarchies of optional complexity without compromising their root mechanics.<br/><br/>For example, the d20 system's basic mechanic has many, many extensions, but it's possible to ignore most of these in favor of fundamental mechanics without seriosuly contradicting the results one might get from the extension. You can use the complex rules for Computer Use, or simply mandate a simple check against a DC, for instance.<br/><br/>Virtually every successful game -- espefcially those that are commonly accused of incoherence -- make use of this feature. They play best when the players understand this and can make informed choices about using the system, and game designers are generally bad at explaining this feature -- in my opinion, because of a misplaced sense of authority over the text.<br/><br/>This is in terms of gameplay, though.

But Dogs is written to a gold standard of clarity, I think, and it's its many fine examples that help make clear how the system functions and why it functions the way it functions are tantamount to saying "understand me fully so that you may feel comfortable hacking me".<br/><br/>I think the other stuff about how the creator interacts with the community is relevant, too.  Vincent is a terribly groovy, laid-back dude who (from what I've seen) doesn't ever say "no, don't play the game that way," etc, etc.   Not to mention he got into the cycle pretty early on, which has lead to some significant "mindshare" on the part of Dogs.<br/><br/>Everything everyone else has been saying since your comment factors in here too.  The only thing that I think is potentially difficult in hacking dogs is in coming up with a good escalation hierarchy; get that nailed down, and your ideas of "demonic influence" clarified, and you're pretty much off to the races with a system that functions <i>as-is</i> in any other application.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109864/#Comment_109864" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T11:50:38+00:00" title="November 27, 2007 11:50AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll put in 2\xa2 that hasn't (quite) come up yet (I agree with all of the above so far):<br/>\n<br/>\nIf game product (a) doesn't provide a fixed, canonical setting or (b) provides several alternate settings or (c) writes-in system toggles and options, then it is inherently hackable.

That's a pretty specific situation, but it's easy to come up with multiple examples.  <br><br>It helps that this situation is one that is really common in popular culture; there's always a hero or two coming to town and cleaning things up.  I think the color and even some specific rules might need to be tweaked, but the situation is pretty similar whether your character is a Dog, a Jedi, a Vampire Archon, a Norse warrior-priest, a superhero, or whatever.  You can plug all that specific stuff in, then let the V8 game engine that Lumpley built drive it down the road.<br><br>For folks like me who love to create but suck at creating mechanics, this is hot stuff.<br/><br/><i>Don't Rest Your Head </i> is another game which posits a very specific situation and backs it up with some really clever mechanics.  It would be pretty easy to change the setting significantly, or do a complete rules mod.  I think Bailywolf on RPG.Net came up with a very neat version of the game for Vampires; sadly, I haven't been able to play the original game yet and I think it's usually a good idea to try it "out of the box" before changing everything.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
