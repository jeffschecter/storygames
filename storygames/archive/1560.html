                    Something interesting has been happening, a new wind a'blowing in my weekly gaming group that I wanted to share, as it's kinda cute.<br/><br/>My weekly group consists of Friends Who Are Also Gamers. In my group there is:<br/>Alan, the "first member". Programmer, Theatre Buff and Indie Music Afficionado (he almost has a seasonal pass to the local music dive, Cat's Cradle)<br/>Beth, the "second member", Programmer by trade, MA in Psychology and believes that the end of the world is nigh (she knows all the symptoms to every CDC Level 3/4 disease)<br/>Andy, the "third member" (as of 2001 or so), Tech geek and Japanese translator<br/>Jeremie, the "fourth member", a French national Biology PhD doing behavior science post-doctorate work at Duke U. Plays a MEAN classical Spanish guitar<br/>Mark, the "fifth member", another programmer and general laid back dillitante.<br/><br/>So, out of the above, me and Alan are the "hardcore" gamers and the only ones who have GMed for the group. In the past three years, though, it's been about 85% me, 15% Alan, though Alan has run some stuff before that. Alan is more interested in traditional gaming, and views anything with "fate points" or "gift dice" etc as "a symptom of a broken system", and loves systems with a robust skill system and advancement mechanic, and using such a system to play in longer/extended campaigns. I'm more into shorter games, and care more about systems that either foster or don't get in the way of cool descriptions and the like. The rest of the group could swing either way.  <br/><br/>Beth is a casual gamer.  Jeremie loves drama and "in character" roleplaying and the like, and also has a habit of becoming REALLY familiar with the rules (he was the only one who consistently remembered the Armor rules in Conan, frex, while the rest of us simply asked him each combat roll what we were supposed to do. For like 6 weeks). Mark is pretty casual, but it has become evident recently that he really wants to put more into the gaming hobby, so much so that he confessed that he wants to give GMing a shot (he never has before, ever). Finally, Beth is brilliant, but not really focused. So we had to, say, keep reminding her how the rules in PTA worked. Very casual gamer.<br/><br/>Anyway, we all had a ton of fun creating a shared world for our Shock: playtest, and realized recently that we wanted to do the following:<br/><br/>* Create a shared world/universe, and define it through play.<br/>* Run an extended game of it using the same system. Like, a year even. Perhaps more, if we're having fun.<br/>* Run with multiple GMs. Everyone but Jeremie will step forward to GM a story-arc/campaign over the course of a year (Jeremie is worried about his English skills, even though he is awesome; but we respect his concern). Some of them will share the same characters, some will be "side stories" with mostly new characters for a short mini-campaign.<br/>* We're going to "dig in". Recently, for the last few campaigns (Unknown Armies, Shadow of Yesterday, etc) I've been "the guy with the rulebook", and have to explain the rules over and over.  Mark suggested, and we all "forehead-slapped", that we should be like Real Gamers, and all get the Core Book for whatever game we play.  We're not fucking poor, so there really was no excuse for us playing The Shadow of Yesterday or whatever for a year with only one copy of the book. This is of course for 4 month + campaigns, not necissarily for every one-shot. But we decided that some of our casual lack of focus is because the players weren't as familiar with the rules as the GM. <br/><br/>So with all that in mind, we decided to have a cook-off to pick a game system that works for us, and works for what we want it to do for a year. The "Main GMs" will be me and Alan, with the others stepping in as needed.  Which is awesome, because I was totally in Brun-Out City lately.<br/><br/>However, as you can smell above, there's a bit of a social agenda friction here. Looking at what Alan and I like, you can see why I totally believe in GNS (even thogh I don't extoll its virtues or whatever); they helped me explain, and face, the tension I was seeing in the group: I am HEAVY Gamist and 'medium'(?) Narrativist (I love rules for personality stuff and "4th wall game pushing" stuff).  Alan is light Gamist and HEAVY Simulationist (Alan loves rules for skill management and growth that reflects 'reality', and loves experience systems in long-term play).  And yet, we're great friends and love the hobby, love hanging out on the table and all... but sometimes get Very Vocal with each other when it comes to scenario planning or What Game We Should Play.  The rest of the group really could go either way, but they definitely favor "rules medium/light".<br/><br/>So, what I've been struggling with is What System Should We Use? I'm definitely the Alpha Male Geek of the group in terms of RPG knowledge. Alan and I ran around looking at various systems to see what would fit our needs. In the end, Alan is standing behind ICAR (a free RPG: www.icar.co.uk ), while I think that Savage Worlds will be a better fit for our group (plus, say Mark or Beth get familiar with it; we can then use it later to play Fantasy or whatever). But in the end, we've chosen systems that won't cause the other to give up in frustration or anything like that.<br/><br/>Since the other group members don't have a really visible agenda or expressed any sort of preference either way (save for the "not heavy rules" thing), Alan and I are having a <b>SHOWDOWN</b> to decide the game that our group will use for the next year.<br/><br/>This Thursday, and the following Thursday, Alan and I will each run a 90-minute or so demo which shows off:<br/><br/>1) How characters 'work'.<br/>2) How conflict works in 2 non-combat situations (one of them is to be "social")<br/>3) How conflict works in combat<br/>4) How gear/tech works<br/>5) How exprience works<br/>6) Other unique things about the system<br/>7) And then wrap up the mini-scenario with a description of the advantages and flaws of that system.<br/><br/>And we're going to at least try to rely on the rules themselves, without hamming it up or drifting TOO much (as it wouldn't be fair; because in play we're going to rely on the rules).<br/><br/>I'll let you know how it goes.  It seriously could go either way. I wouldn't be able to place bets; I do think Savage Worlds is a better overall fit. And I even bet I could ham up a better/more fun scenario to rock the house and/or vote. However, I capitulate far more easily than Alan does, so if it was a "tie" I'd probably flip.<br/><br/>Anyway, the big showdown is presumably tomorrow, or next week if we don't have enough prep time this week.<br/><br/>Savage Worlds vs ICAR.<br/><br/><b>SHOWDOWN!!!</b><br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

Oh, and ICAR? I downloaded it, but I can't for the life of my wrap my head around the smallest fraction of the system. Those little watch face graphic thingies? They look cool as hell, but I'll be buggered if I know what they mean. If you come out of the cook-off with an understanding the game, I'd love it if you could maybe explain it a bit.                        </div>

                            yeah, I gave it a very thorough <i>skimming</i>, and I have to say: Parts of it are unique.  If I had to play, and I mean HAD to play, a percentile throwback system, ICAR would definitely be it.  Its spaceship fighting mechanic (especially ship facing/capital ships) is pretty cool. And unlike these kinds of games, there's not dozens of stats and hundreds of skills. <br><br>However, the "Triangle, Circle, Square" thing throws me off a bit.  Also, the fact that 50% of the character sheet, the "Deviant Matrix", which looks like a WICKED Pendragon "emotional opposites" scale on crack, doesn't do One Goddamned Thing in play.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></div>
