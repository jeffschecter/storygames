But it's not out of bitterness, more incredulity.<br/><br/>As to why we can't all get along, have you met any people? Getting along is one thing we're not particularly good at, especially when there are more than two of you. Some people even have problems getting along with themselves.<br/><br/>We invest a lot in what we do and it's painful for some people when someone comes along and says that they prefer something else. It devalues the investment and can be seen as an attack, even if it's not meant to be. Or perhaps the words aren't well chosen and it sounds the same as if it were an attack, although it wasn't meant to be.

Problems with group dynamics, creative agenda clashes, railroading and the like can be analyzed and solved.  But as far as play itself goes, who can judge one type of play as bad and another type as good?  Design is a different matter.  I'm sure you can find lots of threads talking about how one game is designed better than another.  And that's just fine IMO.

And I'd rather play a game that comes true on it's promises, and make me and my buddies enjoy the gameplay. 80% enjoyment is good enough, but 30% ain't even close. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis" title="RivoClavis"><img alt="RivoClavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis">RivoClavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244787/#Comment_244787" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T05:12:49+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  5:12AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the assumed undertones in the "...but now I only..."  comes from a leftover of older days when people would engage in bitter arguments over the merits and flaws of basically similar traditional games.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we are much more aware of the differences and preferences of play that are out there and thus better able to navigate and choose which gaming experiences to indulge in, but the easiest way to describe that change is by refering to systems or styles of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also the age old human condition that we grow more refined in our tastes as we age and explore things, same goes for roleplaying.

I used to play D&amp;D 3.5, but now I only play D&amp;D 4E. I prefer it. I no longer have any reason why I would want to play 3.5. Maybe you do, but I didn't say anything about that, I only said what I do.<br/><br/>As far as evolution, as Ben and Jeff hinted at, I see an irony in its application here. In biology, where it started, evolution simply means "a change in alleles over time." Only if you also use the idea that "evolution always generates progress" do you get to the idea that something "more evolved" means "something better." "More evolved" really just means "more changed." For instance, Neanderthals had more muscle mass than us, could run faster than us, and by all appearances, had bigger brains than us\u2014maybe, proportionally, only the same size as ours, maybe just plain old bigger. After all, the main evidence of cultural adaptation in the Paelolithic comes when the Ch\xe2telperronian toolset combined elements of the Neanderthals' Mousterian toolset, and our own Levallois toolset. But we didn't do that, the Neanderthals did. So, in just about every way we can imagine, Neanderthals seem "better" than us. But, evolution meant our survival and their extinction. Best theory I've read says they had some tiny number fewer births, so we out-bred them. Evolution means change, and while it does mean better adapting to the specific, current conditions, the one better adapted to the current condition may still have a lot of disadvantages overall. Every so often, evolution means that things get worse. Evolution does not mean the same thing as progress.<br/><br/>That said, using the term "evolution" for games still irks me, because games don't procreate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244808/#Comment_244808" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T07:07:05+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  7:07AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aren't we quibbling over terms?<br/>\n<br/>\nAren't those people simply saying that their tastes have changed over time?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244815/#Comment_244815" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T07:46:35+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  7:46AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as  I can tell, the only people who are making claims about "superiority" are over on therpgsite, where terms like "swine" are used to refer to those whom they regard as <i>claiming superiority over them</i> and their "badwrongfun," which is an overheated way of interpreting the "system matters" game design camp. Meanwhile, over on the Forge, Ron Edwards is bending over backwards to accommodate designers with all sorts of different play and design preferences and has pretty much stamped out invidious distinctions of exactly the sort that Dave is suggesting are pretty common. Over here on Story-Games, you occasionally see people making reference to the "conventional Story-Games wisdom" in the context of evaluating games and their worth, but that's usually a straw man, since game preferences on S-G seem to be both catholic in their breadth and fickle to the point of volatility: what's the new hawtness, dawg?<br><br>There's some conceptual confounding in the way the OP is put together, too. The thread title implies that games don't evolve, but the post itself makes it clear that Dave is talking about claims about a gamer's personal "evolution" as a player of games. But it's quite clear that games do "evolve" in at least a metaphorical sense: we can speak of first-generation RPGs, second-generation, and so forth, implying that later games are responses to and developments of earlier games. It's not genetic, it's <i>memetic</i>, though: the evolution of ideas rather than organisms.<br/><br/>And while, all other things being equal, one gamer's personal play preferences may be as "valid" (meaning what, exactly?) as any other's, it seems clear that unless you are playing solo, it is inevitable that play preferences will either be compatible or incompatible with other's play preferences, suggesting an "ecology of play" in which people adapt their behavior and their understandings of that behavior in order to achieve the highest degree of possible compatibility (e.g., by changing their expectations, by rationalizing their own and other's behaviors, by checking out or quitting the game, by designing a heart-breaker, by talking it out, and so forth). And if there's an ecology of play, then some preferences will be more "adaptive" than (or "superior to," if you like) others, in the sense of generating an optimal experience for the player, under given circumstances.<br/><br/>One final thought: while we're taking care to distinguish between the evolution of games and the evolution of gamers, it's also possible to argue that they "co-evolve," in the sense that certain games are only possible once a population of players exists that is sufficiently familiar with the basis of its design to play it. For example, you can't go straight from minis war-gaming a la <i>Chainmail</i> to <i>Capes</i>, can you? You need the intermediate games, and the people who've played those games, to get there.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244816/#Comment_244816" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T07:47:21+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  7:47AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right.

I mean when you get invited to a game that you don't enjoy, how do you convince the person who invited you that it is not personal? You have to say something that means, "It's not you, it's the game you are playing" and maybe there is no way to get that message through without demeaning the game you dislike...<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244886/#Comment_244886" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T11:48:20+00:00" title="December  3, 2009 11:48AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing is this: Role-playing is not a unified goal or experience.

Now my favorite movie is the one where the men go to the moon."<br/><br/>"I used to play Super Mario Bros, now I play Super Mario Bros Wii."<br/><br/>"I used to play Doom, but now I play Team Fortress 2."<br/><br/>There is a lot of improvement in the nascent genre. Sometimes it's a more skillfully applied game design that opens up new options and ideas (the best indie games compared to most traditional games)<br/><br/>Sometimes it's largely technical improvements that doesn't change the core gameplay, but does refine it in non trivial ways (most D&amp;D editions, HERO, GURPS, Storyteller/Storytelling and other edition steps).<br/><br/>Sometimes it's both increased skill and technical improvements that refines games dramatically changing it so you'd hardly recognize the connection (such as D&amp;D 4th, Diaspora, Warhammer 3rd).<br/><br/>So, no, older games are nothing like classical music, a specific genre of music that's been skillfully refined mastered and changed over the course of centuries.<br/><br/>And no, changing tastes does not automatically mean spitting on old ones. I know people who still play Doom or try to master Tetris.<br/><br/>Neither does recognizing that a new game has a better design or an improved design over an older game. Even chess hasn't gone through the ages unchanged.  New moves and strategies and even what pieces are capable of have gone into the mix.  Games change and get better.

It's the difference between better (objectively better, improved, superior, etc.) and <i>better-suited</i> (properly adapted to get the most use out of a particular niche/situation).  It's amazing how many people assume that evolution is about becoming better, when it's really only ever been about becoming better-suited.<br/><br/>So yeah, your tastes can evolve.  It doesn't mean that techno is objectively better music than classical, it just means that it's a better fit for who you are and what you want than classical was.  And whatever musical genre you switch allegiances to next year won't be objectively better than techno, either...just better suited to who you are next year.  (Oh, okay, probably it <i>will</i> be objectively better than techno -- how could it not be? -- but I'm trying to make a point here.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244921/#Comment_244921" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T13:14:24+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  1:14PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's an interesting parallel somewhere in the fact that you get a whole lot of junk genes and jury-rigged engineering along with your inheritance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244927/#Comment_244927" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T13:43:00+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  1:43PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>I think there's an interesting parallel somewhere in the fact that you get a whole lot of junk genes and jury-rigged engineering along with your inheritance.</blockquote>\nYou're talking about hit points, aren't you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244953/#Comment_244953" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T17:02:59+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  5:02PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>I think I have done this before, said something like "D&amp;D is not really about roleplaying, its more of a wargame" or whatever.

While this belief is, at its root, based upon opinions that others will disagree with, I would say that discussion will help find middle ground.  If anyone wants to discuss this in more detail, just say so, but right now I'm trying to stay within the scope of this thread.<br/>  I think that one thing that makes it difficult to say that some games are better than others is the incredible diversity possible in RPG's.  A few inexperienced roleplayers can have a miserable time playing Dogs, while some players more versed in RPG's can still make something fun and beautiful and epic out of a game of D&amp;D (which seems to be something of a codeword for "games that aren't narrativist.")  In a movie or a book, people will have a more consistent experience.  As Luke said during a discussion of the "Fruitful Void," the key to roleplaying is that it is that "fire" that players bring to the table.  Ultimately, roleplaying is what you make it, and that makes roleplaying games incredibly hard to quantify.<br/>  While roleplaying is what you make it, I would say that a gamelist is superior to others when it is more likely to yield a meaningful, challenging, emotionally involved experience as opposed to an experience that I would say is less edifying and more empty.  And here is where opinion rears its complex head.  Some might say "But I don't think that's what roleplaying is about."  If anyone disagrees with this statement, let's first compare notes on what a good play experience is.  I'm sure that even though I love the tiny Dogs and someone else may have a library of core books, we can still agree on what a good roleplaying experience is.<br/>  With that said, I think that all gamestyles and game lists evolve.  <i>Evolution</i> just means to change over time.  However, I also think that some playstyles do <i>adapt</i>, or become superior to others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244958/#Comment_244958" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T17:16:06+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  5:16PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2009 5:19PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noahtrammell</cite>With that said, I think that all gamestyles and game lists evolve. <i>Evolution</i> just means to change over time.

And the reason why this is so?  Because my set of conditions doesn't necessarily have to look anything at all like your set of conditions.  The games that are perfectly adapted to your needs would not necessarily suit me at all.  The game that delivers the perfectly meaningful, challenging, emotionally involved experience for you may be entirely empty for me, and vice versa.<br/><br/>I <i>really</i> wish that terms like "adapt" and "evolve" had never been repurposed to make value distinctions and to imply that more evolved = better in some universal sense.  I blame creationists for that.  The fact is, there are no hierarchies, only niches...and if something is not in the exact same niche, you have no means for determining if it is, in fact, superior.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noahtrammell" title="noahtrammell"><img alt="noahtrammell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noahtrammell">noahtrammell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244989/#Comment_244989" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T19:22:23+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  7:22PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would it be fair to say that these misconceptions of evolution have arisen from people's belief evolution has some kind of conscious purpose behind it?  As I understand the theory of evolution, its goal is not even to create beings that survive.  It simply <i>is.</i>  I happen to be a creationist, so I'm definitely biased, but I think that this problem actually arises from mankind's instinct to find some kind of deeper purpose in everything.<br/><br/>  However, I would argue that certain games yield experiences which I believe to be more valuable than others, not out of personal preference but because I believe they have intrinsic value.  According to this theory, certain games are superior to others when they are more likely to induce and encourage such experiences.<br/> <br/>  The problem, of course, is that others have to share beliefs in the same intrinsic values of such experiences.  I believe that playing a game of Dogs and dealing with issues of morality and challenging my own ideas of right and wrong is superior to slaying a dragon in D&amp;D because it will develop and expand my experience and challenge my beliefs.  I would argue that this challenging type of experience is superior to the adventures and entertainment I'm more likely to find in a hack-n-slash.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244997/#Comment_244997" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T20:09:16+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  8:09PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2009 8:09PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noahtrammell</cite>Would it be fair to say that these misconceptions of evolution have arisen from people's belief evolution has some kind of conscious purpose behind it?</blockquote>\nBy some peoples' beliefs, sure.

Unless you have some kind of vested interest in making everyone else share your beliefs, anyway.  You're much better off just finding a group of like-minded people and gaming with them, choosing the games that best fit your particular needs.

In fact, it's funny that you bring up music, because when the topic of music comes up in the same places, I find the gamers to be way more closed-minded about music than about gaming.

Surely the entertainment of some vaguely egalitarian sentiments (noble though they are - God bless America, etc.) needn't lead to such radical confusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245431/#Comment_245431" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T21:47:44+00:00" title="December  6, 2009  9:47PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2009 9:51PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite>Does anyone seriously doubt that some games are _better_ than others, or that a person's tastes in gaming can _improve_?</blockquote>\nI certainly don't doubt that.  But I'd say that in the vast majority of cases, "better than others" and "improve" are very personal standards:  this game is better than others <i>for me</i>, my tastes have improved <i>because I am enjoying this new thing more than I enjoyed the old thing</i>.<br/><br/>Is a particular game better than others in an absolute sense?  I don't know, and you don't know, either.  All I can say is whether I think it's better, and that's a call I'm going to make based entirely on where I'm at right now.  If you don't think it's better, that's fine: you aren't me (I hope), there's no reason why you should feel exactly the same way I do.  And if that's where we stand, we don't really need to talk about it.  If anyone wants to make it into a conversation, then they might want to take a page from joepub and avoid non-useful statements like "X is a better game than Y" when they could be saying "I like the way game X handles Z better than the way game Y does" instead, because that has some meat on it and isn't just one person saying "I like!" to the other person's "I don't like!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245445/#Comment_245445" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T23:24:20+00:00" title="December  6, 2009 11:24PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2009 11:24PM by lordgoon.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But I'd say that in the vast majority of cases, "better than others" and "improve" are very personal standards:  this game is better than others<i>for me</i>, my tastes have improved<i>because I am enjoying this new thing more than I enjoyed the old thing</i>.</blockquote>\nSorry, this still doesn't make any sense to me.

Expressions of opinion often come across as expressions of fact.  That's the problem.  That's why many arguments happen when you're talking about something you feel passionately about, whether it be in gaming, film, music, sauce, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Prefacing statements that pronounce relative value with "In my opinion" or "I think" is quite often necessary depending on whether you want to piss people off or not.  Hard statements about comics, pasta sauce or games which put down A in favour of B are going to be antagonistic if directed at a person who really likes B or who hasn't tried A.  \n<blockquote>Yet somehow, with RPGs, when I say "Moldvay's D&amp;D is 10x better than Gygax's" people want to take that as a statement of fact, rather than the statement of opinion which it obviously is, and try to argue the point factually, rather than aesthetically.</blockquote>\nMost gamers are probably wannabe game designers?
