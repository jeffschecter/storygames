I write, design, and draw more when I don't have the net than at any other time. Even writing things down on bits of paper is better for me than writing it in an email. It's why when I am GM'ing GURPS I do plot outlines and such on paper, because that way it gets done.<br/><br/>Number three, and most important (yes, I defy numbering systems that make the first best) is do, not think. That, for me, is the ultimate key to creativity, to do it rather than thinking about it. The only time I think about game design, rather than actually writing it, is when walking home. Doing rather than thinking is horribly hard, thinking is easy, thinking can be done with other things, thinking is not committing, but doing is the important thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180226/#Comment_180226" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T08:19:02+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  8:19AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.physorg.com/news146761238.html" rel="nofollow">Take naps.</a>  "Slow-wave" sleep, which you can get into with a power nap, is when your brain works through problems and comes up with more creative thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180244/#Comment_180244" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T09:21:38+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  9:21AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll echo the comment about trying to get off the net.

I take long walks when I'm stressed or unhappy (doing it at lunch or as a break in the day is great). And the first part of my walk is always going over what is making me unhappy. But eventually that all falls away, and often I get a really cool idea or a breakthrough by the time I need to turn around and walk back.<br/><br/>So basically Ryan, try to get away from the cube farm in those little snippets when you can.

I guess the trick then is to make sure the walk's long enough to get to that second part.<br/><br/>Getting offline is useful, as is avoiding television which after all does all the imaginative work for you.  I'm not saying there watch nothing ever again, there's some great stuff made for tv, but cutting back on it can help.<br/><br/>Some people find having a notebook to hand to record things as they arise helpful, I don't myself but I see upthread many here do and it is worth trying.<br/><br/>Try to mix up your reading as Neil suggests, I intentionally do this as a general thing and keep my reading very varied, but if you read mostly genre fiction say then try to mix that up with some literary stuff or a wholly different genre.<br/><br/>And, JDCorley is correct that focus too is key.  Creativity on its own is nothing, creativity married to focus is where it gets great.<br/><br/>Oh, last thought from me, solititude.  Looked down on in modern society, but I find the sheer psychic pressure of other people sometimes interferes with the creative process, time alone can let you decompact and give you space to hear the quieter voices in you that may be trying to be heard.  If, however, those quieter voices say stuff like "kill them all, they deserve it, the fools", then disregard this bit and try not to listen to them.<br/><br/>By psychic pressure I'm referring to a feeling of such, not literal psychic phenomena.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180617/#Comment_180617" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-27T18:36:08+00:00" title="November 27, 2008  6:36PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I take a walk, go down to the mall and walk to the coffee shop at other end and think about other stuff.<br/><br/>And yes, scribble notes.

I keep a small pad with me for times when inspiration strikes.  I also doodle like mad on sticky notes as I talk to clients or works on resolving issues.  There has been more than one time I have had an idea related to task at work that gets me thinking about an aspect of a game idea and many times (sadly) that a gaming idea has given me a new approach to something at work (I still refer to nested SQL searches as "Ork Code" because in my "Never Home" campaign, Orks tended to plan in the these astoundingly complex if-then-else nestings.  Also, I created a sci-fi game concept based on my airport experiences during business travel - and spending 11 hours in an near-empty airport in Vegas..digressing here)<br>\n<br>\nThe only problem I have with attempting to avoid using the interwebs at work is that sometimes I have an idea that I need to commit to a file AT ONCE (but, because I am a tactile learner, the act of doing that usually gels it in my head with no further reference needed).  I solved this by getting a small USB key that my IT over-watch doesn't mind me using to transport files on and save any docs, doodles, or spreadsheets on.<br>\n<br>\nMy job is also a squeeze and release cycle of action then breathing space, so taking a lap in my head while thinking on gaming gives me a second to disengage and reengage with new perspective every so often.  I would say its a "win-win", but I hate that kind of talk.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
