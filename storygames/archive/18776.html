I never met either man but I knew people who knew them. My oldest minis were made by Scruby and I've played many a game with "Followers of Featherstone". If you don't know about the hobby before "Chainmail" and "Braunstein" then you're missing something cool. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+featherstone+wargamer&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hnIoUqr6L-Hg2AWfoYGICQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=995" rel="nofollow">Here are a bunch of related pictures of the great man. </a><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dcdHJtUXalE/TTM3g4h6HpI/AAAAAAAAC0U/jJGirXARzQ4/s400/Donald%2BFeatherstone.jpg"/><br/>He served in tanks in North Africa and Italy<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.tabletoptalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/don_stan.jpg"/><br/>An early wargame in the 1950's - Don looking for all in the world like the 1st Dr Who<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/3GNfOhnQvMI/hqdefault.jpg"/><br/>Late in his life<br/><br/><a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lp8wa/donald_featherstone_19182013_one_of_the/" rel="nofollow">Obituary</a><br/><br/>Chris Engle - a follower of Featherstone                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421095/#Comment_421095" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T05:55:50+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  5:55AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hal Thinglum's views on Don Featherstone (Hal published MWAN Midwest Wargamers Association Newsletter in the 1980's and 90's)<br/><br/>Hal Thinglum shared Wargames Illustrated's photo.<br/>Donald Featherstone, whom I view as the "Father" of my hobby - wargaming, has died (1918-2013). He was a physical therapist in the UK who after WWII service in the British Tank Corps both in North Africa and Italy, wrote a number of books in his professional field, but dozens of books on wargaming. I modeled my MWAN newsletter on his "Wargames Newsletter" and was so pleased and proud that he remarked that he easily saw the resemblance. I met him several times and corresponded with him although not enough. Donald was always very kind and thoughtful to me. I always felt good that I choose to honor him via MWAN. Not many people know that MWAN published his last issue of Wargamer's Newsletter many years ago! He treated everyone he met well and would talk with anyone. He was always a gentleman. He was devastated many years ago when his only son, a London policeman, was killed in a motorcycle accident. I was touched that Donald sent me a number of his son's books which Donald had written and inscribed to him. His books, in my opinion, gave the hobby the lift it needed to become what it has today. Rest In Peace, Donald. You were a friend of mine.<br/>Like \xb7  \xb7 139 \xb7 18 hours ago \xb7                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421169/#Comment_421169" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-06T09:49:45+00:00" title="September  6, 2013  9:49AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After Little Wars, Donald Featherstone's books were the next step in my miniatures gaming interests.
