Some of you already know me and have spoken/worked with me in the past. A few of you I have met face-to-face at conventions or spoken to via e-mail. I write a weekly column for a newspaper in Parkersburg, W.Va. doing game reviews, which includes board, card and role-playing games. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I am posting here is to let those of you I haven't contacted, or those who haven't seen my reviews, know I am here to look at products and give you all a bit of press. I have been role-playing for more than 20 years and really pushed for the opportunity to do this review column at the newspaper where I work, and so far I have gotten a lot of positive feedback from both locals and those reading online. As far as I know, mine is one of, if not the only, mainstream print column dedicated to non-electronic games. I also do a bi-monthly RPG review column for Graffiti, a statewide publication owned by the same company as the Parkersburg News. I have done reviews of games like "Spirit of the Century," "Don't Rest Your Head," "Best Friends," "Truth &amp; Justice," "Seven Leagues," "Colonial Gothic," etc. A review of "InSpectres" recently ran in the news and will be running in this week's Graffiti, as many of the reviews see print in both.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I will say up front, the circulation of The Parkersburg News is relatively small, about 32,000 in the western part of the state and eastern Ohio. It also is published to our Web site for about a week, and I try to repost the review to RPG.net, and am looking at reposting elsewhere as well. Graffiti, which is a free publication, has a print run of about 100,000, but since it is free it is hard to tell how many of those are getting into the hands of readers and how many readers. It is distributed across the state, in portions of Ohio, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, and tends to be centered around college towns. I keep a LiveJournal account to promote my columns and occaisionaly do a podcast at merb101.libsyn.com. I am looking at doing more audio game reviews, and have been promising Judd a review of "Dictionary of Mu" for a while now. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me also point out a couple of other things. My goal is to get more people to play games and to let people know about some of these games they may not even realize exist. As a result, I only write positive reviews. This doesn't mean the reviews aren't critical, but the  fact is if I don't like a game, I'm not going to write about it. I am trying to get people interested in the hobby, and I feel with the limited number of reviews that see print every month, I can't do that by telling people what games I think they should avoid. If I look at a game and sincerely cannot recommend it to someone, I will let the author know. That has already happened with a couple of board games, but so far I have been pretty picky about the RPGs I've reviewed and it hasn't come up. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich leads me to my next part. I am soliciting review copies. I don't get paid to do these reviews and I don't get any compensation for the price of a game by the newspaper. I have reviewed games I have purchased, like "The Shab-al-Hiri Roach" and a bunch of different board and card games, but I have a limited personal budget so I rely heavily on review copies, .PDFs and the like. I prefer to have a game in-hand, but I have done several reviews based on electronic copies, and I know many indie game publishers operate on shoe-string budgets. I can sympathize with that, and in most cases electronic copies are fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you think you might be interested, contact me at merb101 AT gmail DOT com, or through my livejournal blog at merb101.livejournal.com. Feel free to check me out. You can look at the newspaper online at www.newsandsentinel.com or Graffiti at www.grafwv.com. Feel free to call the paper at (800) 642-1997, or (304) 485-1891. Ask for the executive editor, my boss, if you want to make sure I am on the up-and-up, or if you want to talk to me I'm at ext. 240. I love doing interviews with game creators and posting them on livejournal, especially if I have a review of one of their games going up about the same time. So feel free to look around, kick the tires and see if this is anything you'd be interested in. You will probably see this reposted to some other sites as I am wanting to catch as many game creators/publishers as I can. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the time,<br/>\n<br/>\nME<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Erb<br/>\nStaff Writer<br/>\nThe Parkersburg News and Sentinel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106830/#Comment_106830" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T15:10:42+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  3:10PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Michael, <br/><br/>We really appreciated the review of <a href="http://www.grafwv.com/VideoGames/story/vg21_109200740825.asp" rel="nofollow">The Roach</a>, and we'd be happy to make a PDF of <em>Grey Ranks</em> available to you, if you're interested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107046/#Comment_107046" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T12:47:23+00:00" title="November  6, 2007 12:47PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Steve,<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely.
