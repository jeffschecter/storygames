I don't think anyone "should" do anything at all on the matter, but for my part I've noticed that I get into much more interesting conversations when people notice me reading RPGs or comic books than when I'm reading essays, mysteries or even scifi.  <br/><br/>Sure enough, last night someone noticed me reading <i>Full Light, Full Steam</i> on the bus (by the way, I can't say enough good things about this fun book) and asked me about it; it was the second time in two days.  He was curious, asked about RPGs and story games in general, and we had a very nice chat.  It was a pretty typical conversation for this sort of encounter (in my experience at least), where the person kind of sounds like he's wondering "Wow, I was in that sort of game some years ago, why did I stop?  I don't even <i>remember</i> stopping!"<br/><br/>Overall, it's a source of pleasant interaction for me -- even when I'm not gaming.  :-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91013/#Comment_91013" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T09:59:41+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  9:59AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!

There's no point!  Frankly, the people I want to be friends with are going to be interested in at least a few of my hobbies or at least open-minded enough to consider checking some of them out.  So if I hide what I'm interested in (whether that's rpgs, interactive fiction, sci-fi and fantasy novels, experimental japanese noise rock, or whatever) best case scenario is that someone might want to get to know me and it'll turn out they're not really anyone I have anything in common with, and worst care scenario is that I miss out on getting to know someone who IS into the kind of stuff I dig.<br/><br/>That said, I don't think I'm very good at talking about rpgs.  I mean, I know enough not to blather about "my character" or something, but I have a great deal of difficulty actually explaining what really goes on in an rpg session and why it's fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91028/#Comment_91028" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T10:35:05+00:00" title="August 28, 2007 10:35AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>experimental japanese noise rock</blockquote>\n<b><br/>IMPORTANT QUESTION:</b><br/><br/>Do you mean Boredoms or MAXIMUM the HORMONE?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91036/#Comment_91036" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T10:58:08+00:00" title="August 28, 2007 10:58AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>2) He is a great artist, currently working on a comic book with some friends.

I also like OOIOO (or again, the one album - Taiga - that I own) but would they fall into the same category?  Also on the topic of strange japanese bands I love Melt Banana.  I've got pretty much all of their albums, I think... again, not really sure what to call them, though.  Noise rock seems as good as anything, though I've heard some call them "speed-core" or something.  I saw them live like 10 years ago or something.
