                    I was going to comment on the Task Resolution thread, but I realized that it was prone to definitional problems.  So I thought I'd start a specific mechanics thread.  I've seen in a couple of places people saying that Dogs gives this huge amount of power over to the players.  i.e. That if the players disagree with the GM, they can <i>force</i> the GM to accept something.  <br/><br/>I'm confused by this.  From my point of view, the Dogs mechanic only gives one narrow though important piece of directorial power to the players.  As a player, you are allowed to narrate how you Take the Blow.  i.e. So you can always describe <i>how</i> you are beaten.  However, the GM narrates your successes (i.e. when someone else Takes the Blow), and has power over everything except the PCs.  <br/><br/>As a Dogs GM, I feel like I'm faced with roughly the same difficult choices that I am in other resolution systems.  First, how many opponents are the Dogs facing?  I can toast them outright with a large unified gang, or effectively let them win if they can gang up on a single NPC.  In other systems, I would have to decide both how many NPCs and how tough the NPCs are.  (Whereas in Dogs the NPC stats are fixed by rule.)  However, it has roughly the same effect on PC success -- I try to pick a number which will challenge the PCs but not overwhelm them.  <br/><br/>The other question is, what Stakes do I accept?  This is parallel to the question in other systems of "What do I let the PCs accomplish in a roll?"  If I'm feeling generous, I can give them whatever they want with a success.  If I'm not, then I have to decide how much to give them.  <br/><br/>This isn't meant to be a dig at Dogs.  I like Dogs, but I don't see it as being mechanically different in this aspect of resolution than other games with a GM.  (As opposed to GMless games like Soap or Polaris.)<br/><br/>Do other people handle this differently?  Am I missing something?                </div>

                            The biggest power that Dogs gives the players is that they get to say when it's done.  Seriously -- this is the biggest, fattest elephant in the room when you're playing Dogs.  At any point, even as the Brother Hatfields are killing the Brother McCoys, the Dogs can say, "Alright, judgement time, this crusade between families is approved by the King of Life.  We're heading off to the next town."  It's an extreme example of a far more subtle point -- the GM sets up the town, sure, but the Dogs show up and make the conclusions about the town.  The woman that the GM set up as a grieving victim of a tragic miscarriage gets labelled by the Dogs as a harlot.  The Dogs aren't trying to discover "the solution" or even "what's real" that the GM has set up beforehand.  The Dogs are just rolling in and laying down judgement -- and the players have complete control over that.<br/><br/>What Stakes get used demands that both sides are kind of hard-asses about it.  Sure, you can let the players get away with all sorts of stuff -- and the players can let the GM get away with all sorts of stuff, too.  The game is set up so that both sides have resources (calling a conflict) to call on to prevent that (should they choose to do so).<br/><br/>Mobs, on the other hand, are broken.  This is the biggest problem I have with the game.  There are no guidelines for how to put together a mob in terms of how much is enough and too much, and the fallout rules sort of fall flat when you're talking about ten guys with thirty dice fallout between them.  Mobs would probably be done better by just rolling Demonic Influence for them or something.<br/><br/>But Dogs doesn't give the players directorial power at all, or at least, not much.  (In a sort of minor way, it doesn't give a shit about if there's a water bucket there if you want to use one, which I think is pretty healthy.)  Dogs don't narrate their successes or introduce new characters or any of that.  Mostly it gives the players the power to use resources to get their way (as opposed to using resources to prove to the GM that they've earned it) and the power to resolve the situation whenever they feel like it.                        </div>

In what ways is this different than player exit in other games?  For example, in D&amp;D the players at any point can go back the way they came out of the dungeon and never come back.  In practice, I find that this is rarely used -- not because the players can't mechanically, but for social reasons.  i.e. The GM becomes pissed that he went through the work of designing an adventure and the players just tossed it aside.  <br/><br/>There are some adventures (i.e. Paranoia) where the PCs typically can't leave, but more often the option of PC exit is there.  It's just socially discouraged.  
<blockquote>Mobs, on the other hand, are broken. This is the biggest problem I have with the game.</blockquote>
But mobs are also critical to the game as it presently is.  Without mobs, there is no way to threaten a group of Dogs.  You might as well just let them win every conflict, because that's what they're going to do.  I think we're agree here at least that mob setting is a GM judgement call.  Have you tried out any alternatives in play?

This is interesting.  So the first part I agree with.  That's what I was saying in my first post -- that Dogs doesn't give players major directorial power.  I don't get the latter part, though.  If you agree that the players don't have major directorial power, how do you say that they have the power to get their way?  (Assume the  written rules complete with mobs.)  <br/><br/>Since the stakes are set by consensus, the players will never win anything that the GM doesn't agree to.  So, say I'm GMing Dogs.  The players want a particular conflict.  I can either let them have the stakes they want if they win, or I can disagree and argue them down.  So suppose I'm playing Fudge.  Again, the players want to do something.  I can either give them what they want upon success, or not.  In both cases, there aren't any mechanics for settling disagreement over the stakes.                        </div>

                            Honestly, I think the directoral power of the players in Dogs is often underrated.  I disagree with Joshua in that I feel Dogs CAN introduce new characters and so forth.  The limiting factor on what constitutes a legit Raise or See is up to the group.<br/>
<br/>
I've had players Raise:  "Br. Jeb's daughter walks into the room just as he's about to pull the trigger on his wife and he can't bear to take the shot."<br/>
<br/>
Lumpley suggests the Raise "...your character thinks about that last thing he said for just a second too long, and it doesn't hold up, on account of X; my character just looks at him and watches it happen" is legit.<br/>
<br/>
Is that not the kind of directoral power you're talking about, John?<br/>

                            I'm not talking exit, John, I'm talking ending the story.  If some D&amp;D PCs go down into a dungeon to save the prince(ss), fight some goblins and then high-tail it out of there, the story isn't really over; there is no closure.  If some Dogs roll into town, don't uncover all the bits and pieces that are prepared for them, and declare that they, in their role as divinely-appointed judges, know what's wrong with the town, then whatever drivel they spout <em>is</em> what's wrong, and the story is concluded as they head out into the sunset.  Am I making the distinction clear?<br/><br/>Mobs aren't the only way to threaten a group of Dogs.  A group of NPCs, each with their own die pools, are actually more dangerous than a mob of the same number of NPCs.  Off the top of my head (and not having actually tried it) I'd suggest throwing three mob leaders at a group of Dogs and giving them "helping dice" from their third of the mob.<br/><br/>As for setting stakes -- mostly it boils down to the "most discerning player" guideline.  Yes, it can be abused, sure.  But if you, as the GM, are dicking with the PCs and refusing to let them actually get the stakes they want, I'm thinking your most discerning player is not going to be pleased.  Again, not perfect, and I'm not saying it is.  I do think it is, however, an improvement over Fudge or similar, where the players have no recourse to set or even suggest stakes, and their task-actions do not concretely forward those stakes.<br/><br/>Daniel -- you have a point.  I'd question whether inventing the daughter out of thin air would really fly with most groups.  "Dictating" that a guy has doubts registers around the same level as dictating a water bucket for me.                        </div>

Isn't this what we talked about in the "Dickery" thread?  All games are based on consensus, and thus players always have recourse regarding what another participant does.  Suppose you are the GM in a Fudge game.  If you are dicking with the PCs and making bad calls that refuse to give them what they want, then the most discerning player will not be pleased.  If sufficiently displeased, they will complain and call you on it.  At that point, you have to address their complaint or the game will not continue.  <br/><br/>I talk about this more in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=310&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow"><b>"Sell Me On: Task Resolution"</b></a>, but I don't think that decide-by-commitee is a universal improvement over decide-by-designated-participant.  So decide-by-commitee has the advantage that everyone gets to have their say in the decision.  But there are other advantages to having a responsible person whom you can address complaints to, and who can specialize some in learning handling.  <br/><br/>As for inventing a daughter out of thin air, I don't have my copy of Dogs handy, but that's not how I've been playing it.  My understanding is that a Raise is always an attempted action, and the Block or Taking the Blow describes the result of that attempt.  You can't define things simply by Raising, at least as I've been playing it.                        </div>

Some examples of Raises out of the book include:<br/>
<br/>
- A bird flying across the sun.  (During a quick-draw gunfight.)<br/>
<br/>
- "...flashback to me at the scene of the killings.  I'm bent down, looking at something on the corner of the doorframe: some red mud.  I do it like this between my fingers.  It's the same red mud as up here on the creek bed!"<br/>
<br/>
- I call her by name and ask her ghost to answer your questions. (In a conflict to determine who murdered a woman.)<br/>
<br/>
Do these specific examples contain the sort of directoral power you're talking about or are we looking at different things?<br/>

                            Well, you have a point.  I'm surprised at the second one in particular.  (The third is an attempted character action as far as I can tell, and the first sounds like a bit of color which is pretty incidental.)  <br/>

I included the third because, in my mind, the player was using his directorial power to reveal he had the power to command ghosts or that ghosts exist or that this woman's ghost would come back from the grave to speak with him.  You're absolutely right, though, it could easily just be color and just as easily be a set of circumstances that the GM/players negotiated before the conflict arose.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I use the rule of the most resistant player.  If someone thinks the raise is crap, it doesn't happen.  If everyone's like "cool!" then it happens, no sweat.  (Note the GM is also a player.)  Vincent's suggested that the stuff on your town write-up is immune to player authorship as well (specifically, who is a sinner and who isn't), but I've allowed conflicts to change that as well.<br/>

I dunno, being a nice person.  If you're running Dogs and you disregard that player, you are breaking the rules and not playing Dogs (and being a dick).

<br/>
You ask if you're missing something --  and I'll say yes.<br/>
<br/>
The big important thing you're missing is this: Dogs in the Vineyard is not ABOUT creating proper "challenges" for the abilities of the Dogs or figuring out how large a mob to send after them. Not even close. The book tells you what the game is about from page one, over and over again, loud and clear. I can't understand how you missed it.<br/>
<br/>
You ignore the purpose and goal of Dogs play in order to make your point, which makes the whole thing meaningless, as far as I can tell.                        </div>

                            I have a totally different answer for you, John. My answer is: Dogs presents a way to GM, mechanically supported, but it's not like a <i>new</i> way to GM. Whether any given person finds it new or old depends on that person's own historical GMing.<br><br>If your native GMing style is like Dogs' GMing style, you GM Dogs the way you GM any other game. It seems to me that that's you.<br><br>If your native GMing style is illusionist and unhappy, and you GM dogs, you're like, "oh my goodness the players have all the power ever!

                            To John Harper --   I think that it is a good thing to ignore for a time the flavor text in a game.  Actually, I think it is vital to critical analysis.  As I said, I'm not against Dogs.  Seriously, Dogs rates in one of my top ten RPGs.  I did the same thing to, say, the Lord of the Rings RPG for review.  I set aside it's flowery introduction and GM advice, and dug into what it's mechanics actually accomplish.  Frankly, LOTR sucked, and under the same conditions Dogs rocked.  <br/><br/>My concern in the initial post was that there was what I considered to be at least muddy stuff about how Dogs works.  (Actually, I think my motivation was mostly reading from RPGnet threads -- which might be mixing communities.  Sorry if it seemed like I was responding to anything particular here.)  <br/><br/>Daniel -- Ah.  I've got my copy of Dogs handy now.  The basic rule is: <i>"To Raise, say what your character does and put forward two of your dice."</i>  That's repeated in the later text explaining conflict (<i>"Your Raise is both what your character does and the dice youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re using to back it up. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put dice forward to Raise without describing your characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action.</i>")  But you're right that the examples expand this, particularly expanding on color.  I think I understand the second example a little better now in context.  At that point, the PC has already tracked the NPC into the mountains where the mud is.  So the flashback involves color but its' not establishing new information.  <br/><br/>Vincent -- Yeah, I can see that Dogs works to break Illusionist habits.  I think the strict rules about NPCs and town creation are probably the most critical part of this.  I just felt wierd reading people describing the sweeping power of players to overrule the GM in Dogs, and it being the opposite of other games. <br/><br/>Recently, I was discussing a friend who is in the middle of reading Burning Wheel.  We played a brief Dogs game last summer.  He went on a bit about stakes-setting in Burning Wheel, and I was rather shocked when he said that he didn't even remember stakes setting in Dogs.  It's not like we skipped on anything, but I think it just didn't strike him as radical.                        </div>

                            There isn't any "GM advice" in DitV. There are procedures for play, which are all used in a game of Dogs.<br/>
<br/>
"Say yes or roll the dice" and "Reveal the town in play" are the same as "Your two highest dice are your 'best roll' which determines who acts first." Trying to untangle these and then judge them in a vaccuum is an odd way of reviewing a system, in my opinion. But, to each his own.<br/>
<br/>
Given that as your method, I can see how you could make the claim you do in your first post.                        </div>

Is there a basis in the game text for this?  According to the games rules as I read them, it's very clear that for a player, raising is saying what your character does.  This is repeated many times.  <br/><br/>Now, I realize that Actual Play doesn't always conform to the rules as written.  So I guess this would seem to be a common case of Drift, in Forge terms.  But I think it's important to recognize the difference.  As a parallel example, when I played a demo of 7th Sea in 1999, the GM very clearly gave directorial power to the players.  He insisted that we should always simply narrate the things that we want into existence instead of asking him.  I thought it was an interesting drift of the system, but had some issues with it.                        </div>

                            You're not seeing the possibilities inherent in the raise, I think.<br/>

The player could have his dog do ANYTHING AT ALL to an NPC, as long as it doesn't resolve the stakes of the conflict.<br/>
