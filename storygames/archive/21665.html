In this sense, "break" doesn't mean fundamentally breaking the game and making it unplayable, but that the cards open up exceptions, and in Magic this results in new avenues of play to exploit.<br/><br/>While not exactly analogous mediums, I think that cool freakin powers in RPGs can follow a similar path; they open up new avenues to interact mechanically with the game that wouldn't be as accessible or as feasible without the power. While they don't have to necessarily create whole new mechanical subsystems in and of themselves, I think they work best when they interact with the core mechanics in a way that the "normal player interface" doesn't allow (sort of like basic moves vs playbook-specific ones in PbtA games).<br/><br/>That, or they may be niche but have effects that are powerful enough to significantly influence the direction of the game. If you look back after the fact and can say, we might have still got what we wanted, but we wouldn't have been able to do it the way we did without X, then I think that's the mark of a good and influential power.<br/><br/>One other thing to consider is when the cool freakin powers exist primarily to highlight the cool freakin setting, when their effects and their description serve to create flashy cinematic moments. This strikes me as a very Supers-style use of powers, being that the cool freakin powers are one of the most defining features of most supers stories. Here, their use is almost de facto necessary to differentiate the story from some other kind of adventure tale, no? (Note: I'm not particularly super hero literate, I'm sure that I am erasing large swaths of what makes the genre unique and special; I don't mean to say that this is all that supers stories are, just that it's another potential use of cool freakin powers)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474060/#Comment_474060" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-18T21:05:15+00:00" title="May 18, 2018  9:05PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Goodman Games' <i>Dungeon Crawl Classics</i> has individual tables for every spell with freakin' cool results at higher levels.

Though it may have some good lessons to teach.<br/><br/>I think the breaking the rules in some specific way is probably a good way to go, in that way powers aren't differentiated from any other character abilities. There should be clear limits to how and when you can break the rules if only to increase the enjoyment from overcoming a challenge. <br/><br/>Personally to make cool Powers work well I think you need to have the system they exist in be intuitive to understand otherwise the rules of the system feel arbitrary. If the rules feel arbitrary there's no feeling of agency. In fiction the reader needs to understand the system sometimes be able to predict outcomes that makes them feel like the system is real it has real stakes and operates on a real set of rules even though it's "magic"<br/><br/>In gaming we have systems and rules and yet sometimes it doesn't feel coherent it doesn't feel predictable and in my own experience I don't think players always feel rewarded for coming up with creative ways to circumvent rules, because questions of balance descriptions of how spells or whatever are supposed to work. Which leads to min-maxing which if we're talking about that then where already on Shaky Ground for a real discussion. Because you can't just keep patching in more rules to control human behavior and expect the outcome to be enjoyable. At some point you need to redesign the system so it has enjoyable outcomes.<br/><br/>Those lists of spells for example I feel do not create a feeling of some coherent system behind rules. Sure there are rules the rules say you can have this spell list when you meet these requirements but they're often not intuitive or easy to understand. I'm very interested in systems that allow players to make things up on the spot but with a coherent system of cost and rules that make it feel as if their powers or magic or whatever exist in a coherent system one that they can at a glance intuitively understand. <br/><br/>I think GM's often fear that players will have unlimited power that will unbalanced a game, but if there's a coherent system that explains how Powers work then that's almost a non-issue it should be self-evident what the players can and can't do. I think if we're talking about adding a cost or a risk we're almost having the wrong discussion really it should be how can we make the cost and the risk obvious because this is how the system works. Just like how physics Works. Physics as a set of rules but if you understand them you can do things that would seem like they're breaking the rules but if you understand the rules better you realize you're not. Magic or Powers should feel like that even if they're not actually like that. <br/><br/>Sorry for wall of text, kind of a stream of consciousness going on. For the record I don't think most fiction gets this right let alone games.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frenzykitty" title="frenzykitty"><img alt="frenzykitty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/557/n6V5J0A17A1B2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frenzykitty">frenzykitty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474065/#Comment_474065" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-19T02:41:44+00:00" title="May 19, 2018  2:41AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Johann" rel="nofollow">Johann</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Goodman Games' <i>Dungeon Crawl Classics</i> has individual tables for every spell with freakin' cool results at higher levels.

That's my deliberately provocative opinion, anyway. ^_-<br/><br/>Exception-based design in <i>Magic: the Gathering</i>? All of those cards are just chess pieces. A huge number of different chess pieces, sure, but they can only be cool the way a rook or knight is cool... Exceptions <i>are</i> the basic game moves there. What's really cool is cobbling together a novel strategy. The fact the cards represent magical spells (and armies)? Window dressing.<br/><br/>Look at you all, confounding "cool powers" with "showy, campy special effects"! XD<br/><br/>I see a lot of (basically) D&amp;D talk here, and equating "cool powers" with "spells". But what are spells, in most flavors of D&amp;D, if not standard-issue weaponry? Turn the special effects to eleven if you wish, but the <i>actual effects</i> remain generally tame, as it's typically been a designer's first concern that such spells don't "break" the game. Enter 4E, where they tried to make <i>everyone</i> feel "cool" by giving all PCs a same-length list of canned special effects - chess pieces with funny viking hats - while at the same time bringing the casters in line: PCs can't "break" a DM's planned storyline in D&amp;D4, as long as the DM remotely realizes what D&amp;D4 is like at the time of planning! This plan backfired, specifically in that a large swath of the audience didn't think the funny-hat chess pieces <i>cool enough</i> or objected to the apparent rigorous sameness of the PC classes (I think that was merely good design, in a conventional BG/CCG sense).<br/><br/><i><b>EDITED TO INTERJECT</b></i>: what I'm trying to say is, <i>actual</i> cool powers in a RPG have to be more than just <i>special effect guns</i>. /end interjection<br/><br/>Thus, I think <a href="/forums/profile/Johann">@Johann</a> is up to something when saying:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Johann" rel="nofollow">Johann</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Such effects are very evocative - <b>like something straight out of a fairy tale</b> - and their massive impact make them an <b>effective antidote versus railroading</b>.</p></div></blockquote>\n<small>I'm also a bit sad you brought up the bugbear of "balance" in the very next paragraph.

Sometimes it's social or a specific player praxis, but it's often about fictional or mechanical oomph. For example, if there's only one magic-user at the table, it's a hell of a challenge to make a truly low-magic game. Even if the setting is low-magic in theory and in a lot of practical ways, the need to justify the magic-user and arrange NPC reactions around their magic immediately ramps up how much the game is <i>about magic</i> - which often feels distinctly not-so-low-magic even if it doesn't increase the actual magic in the game.<br/><br/>Now, that's just one example and isn't necessarily a problem. It can even be a fine way to give a game some focus. But when everybody gets Cool Freakin' Powers, it's easy to get excited about how fun those powers will be in combat or would be in some TV show - all without realizing that one or two of those powers are subtly, but crucially more game-warping. I can't tell you the number of times I've participated in a game that gradually tapered from universal excitement to realization that everything is, in some way, orbiting around one player's Cool Freakin' Power that maybe isn't so fun anymore despite being something everyone liked and agreed to in the beginning.<br/><br/>So, I'm all for Cool Freakin' Powers, but I've learned to majorly prefer ones that help you feature other players and what they want as opposed to ones that allow you to be singularly awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474071/#Comment_474071" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-19T09:13:26+00:00" title="May 19, 2018  9:13AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2018 9:44AM by DeReel.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me you're in between two visions (and maybe too much in your agenda), Kenny_J. I identify these visions like this : <br/>1 - universal system (GURPS, Hero, etc.) where everything is coherent and predictable, with some duct tape to hold everything together.<br/>2 - dramatic simulation. Maybe it's me, but when you say you want fun and creativity, no min-maxing, etc. I can't help but read : drama - drama -drama. (Yes, <a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a> , only awesome special effects, but look my last two paragraphs, where fiction takes care of itself.)<br/>For me, drama is not limited to playing scenes. It's about managing dramatic tensions (build-up, threshold, release, cool down, etc.) So it's also storytelling. There are rules for that, very ancient ones, and I think we've all been subjected to so much fiction we have integrated them. So, it's predictable, coherent, everything. It's just no more how many dice of damage the blast does, it's how it will affect the course of events. Hamlet Hit Points games reach toward that (with lots of opportunity for misunderstandings).<br/><br/>I don't see the need for special rules for special powers. Why do you feel the need for mechanical "teeth" there ? As you say, cool powers have something that make them instantly likeable all by themselves. Either it's cool freaking colour, because, for instance, all the players at the table contribute to create them (that's what I choose to do with my game), so it's <i>our</i> freaking coolitude. Or because the colour is made by a colour artist. Or because everybody at the table is 13 and any colour will be better than what school and family have to offer. <br/><br/>The difficult part is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">keeping</span> the powers cool, so I'd try to protect them from abuse. To me, despite what you said, power description is a good way to obtain that. Or rather, power exploration. Power description establishes bricks of a code, which allows you to play narrative lego with them. Play will be following a form of logic, consistency, verisimilitude, just like you want. <br/><br/>It's really world exploration, but focused on the biofilm between characters and setting : how PCs affect reality, how reality constraints their use of powers. I have a whole diagram of it, but I'll be brief as this is becoming a Wall of Text : character concepts, resources, factions, society &amp; landscape are all linked together directly or via Powers. Starting the exploration at one node, you can build in all directions. The shift with trad games is that it's now about discovering, in earnest, not bringing down the whole system on the players, which usually suffocates play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474080/#Comment_474080" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-19T19:26:16+00:00" title="May 19, 2018  7:26PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been dabbling on this stuff for 15 years, and it was one of the reasons that brought me to design my own games. The other one was Anima Beyond Fantasy.<br/><br/>ABT is the wet dream of an anime fan that had never read or plain hated any other RPG except Rolemaster. But you only realize that after you try to play the promise of kewl powers and find the thing is so disorganized, complicated, cumbersome, incomplete, arbitrary, counterintuitive and contradictory. If you're like me, by the time you have reach that conclussion you would probably be halfway through hacking the whole game into something playable and ready to start making your own version of it from scratch.<br/><br/>10 poor but fun hacks later you'll notice that one of the main problems of balance with kewl powers happen whenever these never fail; as they becomes a tool for player railroading then. It's not that they must be unreliable, but that things like using them a tad bit too late CAN happen, or that the way they modify the world CAN be undone or stopped by another cool power or situation. The power may never fail, but the PC may not achieve what she wanted to do. The moment this chance dissappears, even (specially) for the least kewl powers, the game becomes unbalanced. <br/><br/>Like, the "create water" spell that creates an amount of water inside a container as per the spell description, and it's obviously designed to fill a canteen... but as worded can totally be used to fill the brain of an opponent with water to kill him. Now, instead of changing the spell mechanic or invent a poor explaining for why it can't be used on opponents, why not enabling it to use an attack roll?<br/><br/>There's actually no problem with powergamers finding these cool rules combo and break the game for a while, any GM knows or learns quickly how to deal with it. The problem is that things like these kill the conflict and the drama. When the hero gains a power that nobody can stop, that's the moment the story dies.<br/><br/>All right, another 10 better made hacks later you will realize that just having kewl powers isn't actually good enough if they all just enable your character to do something awesome. I mean, yes, you can be totally awesome and now you've got external conflict to put the fun in it, but what about internal conflict? What do players do with their now useless powergaming skills? Is that fun dead or can we have our cake and eat it too? Well, yes, it's doable and it's been done before.<br/><br/>It can be as easy as giving the powers activation conditions that must be achieved by maneuvering in the fiction, and then giving players bonus dice/re-rolls for achieving anything else that can help that power work better/more efficiently. Like, make magic depend on a power source so the mage has to first think of one around him and then use their will to gain it's control. Let's say the wizard decides to use the heat of the campfire, which will dissappear when the spell is cast. Now, that gives the wizard 2d6 of fire damage, but he still needs to make his attack. But what if he's got a few hairs of his opponent? Then he may have advantage to roll the attack!<br/><br/>I'm still working on this design and it will probably use just a dice pool of d6 and resume damage on the attack roll, but so far it makes reality-warping powers viable for balanced play, as long as the GM finds a way to make challenge stakes interesting enough for characters of such power level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474081/#Comment_474081" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-19T20:11:28+00:00" title="May 19, 2018  8:11PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2018 8:45PM by Johann.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" rel="nofollow">Kenny_J</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I'm very interested in systems that allow players to make things up on the spot but with a coherent system of cost and rules that make it feel as if their powers or magic or whatever exist in a coherent system one that they can at a glance intuitively understand.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>Just like how physics works. Physics as a set of rules but if you understand them you can do things that would seem like they're breaking the rules but if you understand the rules better you realize you're not.</p></div></blockquote>\nThe German <i>Saga</i> system works like that: <b>There are no spells, just the rules of magic.</b> There are different factors (range, speed at which the effect unfolds etc.) which allow the player to calculate the difficulty of just about anything you could think of. For instance, the difficulty for the "mass affected" factor goes something like this "no mass involved or up to 100 grams / up to 10 kilograms / ..." (not linear, by the way).<br/><br/>However, this particular implementation does not yield what I would call "freakin' cool powers": <br/><br/>Using telekinesis, I and my fellow players would not lift up guards to slam them into the ground, but instead triggered their crossbows (to unload them), tripped them etc. Small, unobstrusive stuff, in other words.<br/><br/>Similarly, extremely powerful casters would not disintegrate a target in a flashy display of magic but merely disintegrate a ventricle (still very difficult but "up to 100 grams").<br/><br/>But I seem to be on a different wavelength here (and unfortunately don't know Brandon Sanderson either).<br/><br/><small>I'm also a bit sad you brought up the bugbear of "balance" in the very next paragraph. I don't think you can have radical RPG design and conventional gameplay predictability at the same time.</small><br/><br/>This reminds me of a quote from <i>The Incredibles</i> which goes something like this: <b>"If everyone is super, no one is."</b><br/><br/>I specifically chose DCC for our current campaign <i>because</i> of its unpredictability (as captured by its many tables for critical hits, spell effects and so forth). However, I think that 'buying' an effect by temporarily sacrificing ability points is the opposite of unpredictability (so I immediately houseruled that part).<br/><br/>I think it's very cool and refreshing when a low-level wizard uses <i>colorspray</i> and wipes out half a village by accident (as happened in our campaign, among many other things). But balance is indeed a concern for me: I don't want him to be able to plan this (or at least not trivially so).<br/><br/>Other than that, I wholeheartedly subscribe to Jeff Rients' advice to think of your campaign world as "that place the PCs will destroy and remake in their image".<br/><br/>(That said, games where PCs can reliably and repeatedly use awesome powers are of course viable.

I will only say that I am not interested in just bandages here like \u201coh we just made it a rule you couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d But rather reconstructive idea if there is one. <br/>---<br/><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel">@DeReel</a> I agree that I might be conflating two separate ideas a bit. I am interested in cool powers that are enjoyable to play, allow players to be succeed by thinking creatively about their powers, AND I like the idea of intuitive hard \u201cmagic\u201d systems because they are fun to explore and utilize in my imagination. Your right that they won\u2019t go together for every instance (In fact a soft magic system would be preferable in some thematic cases for sure). I just put them together because I think they would complement each other in a successful way. <br/><br/>As for your 1,2 distinctions, I don\u2019t see them as useful to me. I don\u2019t see this is a universal system vs dramatic problem, just that as stated above I think it would help a lot to have a coherent magical something to build off.  But I can see that my stream of consciousness didn\u2019t help with explaining that. I will try to be clearer in the future.<br/><br/>And I agree approaching powers through Drama (or simply descriptive fictional positioning) sounds like a useful way to go personally. I would state it in this way, powers do not need to be handled separately but as an intrinsic aspect of the dramatic fictional narrative and as such fall in line with peaks and valleys of that narrative. Let me know if that\u2019s way off from what you were getting at.<br/><br/>I\u2019m not sure what you mean about wanting special rules or mechanical teeth, was that aimed at me? As for power descriptions I am not against them outright, I just think they shouldn\u2019t be structured in a patchwork arbitrary way like spell descriptions in D&amp;D. I like the sound of power descriptions like bricks but would need an example. More on this in my response to WarriorMonk.<br/><br/>Bottom line DeReel, I think we are more on the same page than not.<br/>--- <br/><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a><br/>I hear ya, this same sort of thing got me wanting to design. <br/><br/>I wouldn\u2019t have thought about failure as a necessity but I think you are on to something. I would have assumed that powers always have a chance to fail, but perhaps that me not examining my own gaming experiential bias. <br/><br/>So the "create water" spell is a great example of a bad spell/description to me. Or not bad but I think indicative of something that\u2019s not helping (IMO of course). I would rather have a power described as \u201cyou can control small amounts of water\u201d and then a player thinking \u201chey can I pull water from the air ?\u201d Well does condensing water fall under control? Now when they want to use their power of water control to attack their not breaking the rule their applying it. Naturally I would say, \u201chow do you go about doing that?\u201d In a pbta game you would just make it a custom move, and that works well but I would rather see a system that doesn\u2019t need you to write down a new move/rule/ect every time. <br/><br/>I agree I have no issue with power gamers, rather I would like to make the fight between balance and power gaming irrelevant. I\u2019d like to see a style of play where someone who just wants to get really good at using a power and someone interested in exploring the cost/risk/consequences of strange abilities can both get what they want in the same game seamlessly. <br/><br/>I really like your campfire example, and have absolutely thought along those same lines. I don\u2019t think we came up with that I know I read that somewhere (unless that was you). The only difference I would add is that I was thinking more about a limited about of power points (or whatever) and you might have to go outside you power to achieve your result by using your surroundings. It was just a lot of thinking though and I never came up with a system.<br/>---<br/>I have given up making this not a wall of text, sorry.

I think one of the best examples of this that I have played a lot is Monster of the Week. Everyone can use magic, its just a matter of adding chaos to the mix. If you roll poorly the bell curve says in most cases you get what you wanted but its not all you got. <br/><br/>I personally am in favor of the thinking you can shoot for any outcome with a power but its a matter of how much risk you want to take. For example a player has terrakinesis if they want to move a small rock basically zero risk (maybe you get tired if you do it over and over but yeah low risk) But if you want to move a mountain, "sure you can try, but wow that sounds really risky!"

Fair play as it relates group fun and negotiating towards that result rather than fair play as it relates to mechanical game balance - if you're playing a game that is broken out of the box, either don't play that game or it's a case-by-case rule fix.<br/><br/>Even though I think a massive bulk of play issues that people assume are rule-based are actually down to table culture, social issues, and player choice/awareness, I think most people are naturally pretty good at fair play. It often takes a bit of experience, but most people can tell when some player character is game-deforming, even if they aren't aware of <i>exactly</i> how much. You often see it in how players choose their characters in relation to those deformation points.<br/>For example, I'm in a Monster of the Week game. One of the players is the town sheriff. Mechanically, this character doesn't register on the Cool Freakin' Powers chart; but, fictionally, that's a person with a lot of power, information, and responsibility. If the rest of us weren't comfortable with that being an inevitable focal point, we could have negotiated away from that or figured out characters that balance out the focus. But we were cool with it and some of us made our characters directly involved with/related to the sheriff. Without even discussing it directly, we knew that the game could easily warp around the sheriff to a decent degree and we embraced it and made our characters a fundamental part of it.<br/><br/>If you don't recognize those signs and your campaign is in full-swing when issues start happening, it's a lot tougher to change. Even if you figure out a change that people like, it will often permanently take some wind out of the game's sails. If you don't want to wave a big flag and rearrange, it can take a sensitive and clever GM and/or players to see what's happening and quietly guide the game's focus.<br/><br/>As for how to better recognize those signs from the outset? The best repeatable practice is probably discussing your game with each other before it begins (and as it's happening! End-of-session check-ups can be really good). Everyone should be aware of each other's expectations. Some of those expectations might be misaligned with the other players' expectations or what the particular system can even do. Getting everyone on the same page can make exceptions in the setting and characters clearer to everyone and it gives them a chance to adjust.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474096/#Comment_474096" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-20T10:46:10+00:00" title="May 20, 2018 10:46AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2018 3:06PM by DeReel.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The sheriff case is an example of the setting building technique I tried to present.

Did we mean the same thing ? etc.)<br/>I'll take an example from AP : I played with my son, building from scratch. We say we want powers. My son wants vaguely medieval, I ask for elements of fantasy. I say "vaguely" because we don't mind if it's XIXth century by some aspects, we don't know more than that, ready to adapt. I want to play a wise old trickster, he wants a rebellious noble (see how we reword the father/son relationship here ?) We say we want cool powers. This is sort of a blank cheque we're signing ourselves up for later. Now we decide on the resources for our powers. It's a node in building the setting : what have we got that gives us the powers ? We want to have powers that are super cool, so we make the resources uncommon. that way we can kick ass and very few can kick back. That's the real power ! I want access to magic to take high competence. I decide magic is "sufficiently complex technology". And BAM, a big part of the setting is already on its way : my faction is a (non homogenous) cast of engineers that pass as magicians. Maybe the technology comes from Progenitors (aka Reptilians), maybe we're really on post-apo earth. Who cares at the moment ? My son says, of course, power comes from his blood : it's hereditary. Making the leap to genetics I present a possible plot that I need his royal blood to open a portal of some kind (as an homage to Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert) hidden in the palace. He says he's the rebellious Prince in disguise on its way to reclaim the throne from the tyrant. So we have linked goals (does it show we tailored them to that purpose ?) and various factions : rebels, royals working with technology, mages who refuse to work for the kingdom or the rebels, at least one foreign power, with its own take on technology (they turned out to have a few convenient military weapons, flying vehicules and spying nano-devices), and possibly Reptilians from an intergalactic, x-dimensional empire. <br/><br/>TL;DR 1<br/>These were just consequences of our archetypal PCs and their roughly defined powers. No rocket science. It takes 30 minutes to create PCs, power, resources, plots, factions and they are insta-weaved. You can use my "same page" and "setting" sheets if you want. <br/><br/>This goes further : later in the game the Prince in disguise under attack by royal guards orders them to go away and, just like that, they turn around and go. My son wanted to use his "command" trait, and simply botched narrating the consequences, which were like - a bit too much, to the point of absurd. But, hey, cool powers : I described the guards walking like animated tin soldiers and getting back into their barracks, the doors closing on them by themselves. So from then on we knew : royal guards were in fact automatons and had something like a voice recognition software that could override other routines. Our PCs only suspected it, so : dramatic irony, investigation.<br/><br/>TL;DR 2<br/>The world was building up every time we played (3 sessions were enough, we only outlined the end). We just held to what we had introduced in the world. Powers are just convenient, a "narrative blank cheque". It's on the players (storytellers) to make sure the story can cash on it. You know what they say about great powers.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474098/#Comment_474098" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-20T19:21:25+00:00" title="May 20, 2018  7:21PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think the idea of scripting balance into the power system is an old solution (or rather an old problem).

I would usually be okay with the "price" just adding more story elements or character moments. To me its just an extension of character or world exploration (or it should be). I think Monster of the Week does this well.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Cool powers are only "cool" because no one else has them.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI'm not sure If I agree with you here. Others clearly do as seen in the above responses. <br/><br/>Lets say you were playing a harry potter style wizard game, everyone at your school is a wizard, your just one of many. But magic is still not something you experience in real life, so I think it still counts. <br/><br/>But I do agree that cool powers work better if given the opportunity to become more unique. Harry Potter may not be the only wizard who can perform magic, but he has other qualities that make him unique in that context. I would still argue his run of the mill magic counts as cool powers, just maybe not his coolest. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Typical power fantasies : social compensation (be obeyed, have an aura), breaking the law (destroy, offense, be invisible), nurturing one's values (growing plants, tinkering, healing), mimicking dream experience (flying, riding, going to the spirit world). <br/>And this article <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://theenemyreader.org/problematizing-power-fantasy/&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_8JOsyJbbAhXExRQKHRdVDRIQFggNMAE&amp;usg=AOvVaw21SY6D5xEcSVhl3BXjsqLS" rel="nofollow">Problematizing power fantasy</a>.

Definitely a good guide when thinking about the kind of motivation goes into the "powers" of your game. I also like it because it gets you thinking about the kind of rewards that will make for better play experience depending on what a player is trying to get out of it. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think a power becomes cool or not based on the kind of narration it begets.

I do think some implementation of cool powers are more likely to beget cool narration though. But a lot of this subjective of course. Hence me going off on having a "coherent system." Its also why I prefer hard sci-fi (historically at least). For me its more real if it seems possible.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474126/#Comment_474126" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-22T20:12:44+00:00" title="May 22, 2018  8:12PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This reminds me of an online serial fiction story about superheroes. It's called "Worm":<br/><br/><a href="https://parahumans.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://parahumans.wordpress.com/</a><br/><br/>It's extremely long (though it remains interesting throughout), but it has one of the most unique, interesting, and compelling presentations of "superpowers" I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Basically, in typical "superhero fiction", someone has a power like a laser blast, which they always use to, well, laser blast things. They are treated as "the character with the laser blast, who laser blasts things", and the fiction celebrates that.<br/><br/>In <i>Worm</i>, though, the superheroes act like real people who have put a lot of thought into what they can do and get really creative with it. What else can I do with this laser blast?<br/><br/>Many of the most effective/powerful characters in the story have powers that seem rather useless or ineffective on the surface, until they think of more innovative uses for those powers. It's really quite an interesting exercise in superhero fiction, completely unlike any other superhero genre fiction I've seen to date.<br/><br/>For instance, the "super-genius" heroes and villains are <i>actually super smart</i>, which, again, rarely happens in typical superhero fiction. That alone sold me on the story.<br/><br/>For someone interested in discussing powers and how they can be used, it's a really worthwhile read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474130/#Comment_474130" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-22T21:34:36+00:00" title="May 22, 2018  9:34PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll take a look Paul.
