You're not supposed to protect your Pilgrim. She's not supposed to be a boring, flawless hero. She is going to get into trouble. You will be lead to your Pilgrim's weakness again and again, and that's a good thing!<br/><br/>Every game needs a rule like this. (The first sentence of <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> should be "The object of this game is to drive your character's sanity to 0." There, I fixed it for you!) Games like D&amp;D or Vampire, where getting your character killed really does reduce your ability to contribute to the fiction (rules as written), are fundamentally broken as potential literatures, because they incentivize players to "protect" characters, "advocating" for them. D&amp;D is a set of rules for making short, bearded Mary Sues. Vampire is a set of rules for making Mary Sues with heavy eye makeup.<br/><br/>I don't know if this even merits a discussion. I specifically avoided posting in the "Character Monogamy: Does it Suck" thread, to avoid giving the appearance of trolling, but here you go. Character monogamy: Does it lead to Mary Sueism? Some say it is so.<br/><br/>That is all. &lt;/rant&gt;.

Didn't realize character death was so common in Do.</blockquote>\nDo avoids character death by not having death be the stakes.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with most adventure game systems - D&amp;D, Savage Worlds, Shadowrun, etc. - is that death is the default stakes, and it's really easy to forget to add other stakes in because you have crunchy combat systems with death as the default failure point.<br/><br/>And most players don't really want death as the stakes most of the time, even when they say they do. So the games put so many obstacles in the way of death - hit points, healing surges, bennies, etc. - that it makes it so that death isn't really the stakes until you've used up lots of other resources first. Because once you've used up those resources, you start feeling vulnerable and tense, but then that doesn't last very long, because you win and get your resources back.<br/><br/>That's why so many more recent games have focused on other forms of failure, other than death. <br/><br/>Cause, ultimately, death is a pretty boring failure. And merely not-dying isn't much of a win.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350179/#Comment_350179" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T14:41:13+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  2:41PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>"using the D&amp;D full ruleset grants you to have a game for sizzies.

That is so obviously better that I shouldn't even have to say it.Agreed.  Mostly.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd say that playing <i>about</i> Sanity loss is more important than specifically playing <i>toward</i> Sanity loss.  Driving toward 0 is probably the clearest and easiest way to enjoy the game, but it also messes with the player-to-character relationship that a lot of players prefer.<br/><br/>I like trying to stop the badguys.  And I like the color CoC imparts to that.  But <i>whether</i> you stop the badguys is not supported by anything about the game.  Any choice I make or die I roll is on the GM to translate into relevance, and most GMs don't have particularly rewarding systems for doing that.  Accordingly, my inclination is to worry less about <i>whether</i> I stop the badguys, and more about the experience of trying.  <br/><br/>And that experience is about curiosity, omens, majesty, anxiety, fear, horror, and madness.  That's why most folks are drawn to CoC rather than some other "stop the badguys" game, right?  So, in terms of support for that experience, there's color, and then there's Sanity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350196/#Comment_350196" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T15:52:52+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  3:52PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2011 3:53PM by akooser.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played CoC (the Chaosium one) somewhat like what ccreitz and David are talking about.

I'm just curious since it seems at odds with that philosophy on death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350198/#Comment_350198" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T15:56:05+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  3:56PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>D&amp;D:  Life is unfair.

If D&amp;D* (or other "unfair" games) are supposed to be life sims, they are broken in many more areas than if you approach them as the story makers their texts and/or rules tend to focus on. I'm not buying that there's an unwritten "life is unfair" theme.<br/><br/>*Except for the original D&amp;D. That was clearly a game about fantasy characters setting out to prove themselves to be heroes and quite often with deadly consequences due to life (and Referee's) being unfair (and/or cruel).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>As a player, I have an infinite number of awesome characters in my head.

The problem might be, outside of horror stories, we don't have many good models on what a high rate of protagonist death looks like. Either they die at the end of Act 2 or during Act 3, or they're never presented as important as the actual protagonist(s).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350202/#Comment_350202" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T16:13:07+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  4:13PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a middle ground between "My character is a flawless immortal immune to any negative consequences" and "My character is a failure missile launched directly at endless catastrophe," isn't there?  Like, one where you want your character to succeed and prosper despite the inevitable struggles and setbacks that will confront him?  Or even one where different people can get different things out of the same game?<br/><br/>My best friend is famous for deriving great pleasure from the suffering of his PCs; he makes characters who aren't just bad at what they do, but are actually actively self-destructive, going to great lengths to snatch a personal defeat from the jaws of even the most overwhelming victory.  The more cringe-inducing and awful the consequences for his characters are, the more fucked up they are by what has happened, the happier he gets.  And that's fine, <i>for him.</i>  It's what he likes.<br/><br/>He doesn't force that on anyone else, though; if he's running a game and his wife is playing, he doesn't hammer her character with misery after misery, because that's not what she likes.  She likes her characters coming through a challenging situation having learned something and bettered themselves in some definitive way, and so his magic formula of character+situation=disaster=fun just won't work for her.  When he's playing in a game, he doesn't insist upon every other PC suffering as much as his PCs do.  He knows that for our games to work, everyone's gotta get something out of it that they like, and that means we won't all drive our play down the narrow slaughterhouse chute that he prefers.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>Cause, ultimately, death is a pretty boring failure.

What are all those modules for if the goal is not to put your guy in danger?</blockquote>\nDo you succeed by defeating the bad guy?<br/>Or by putting your guy in danger?<br/>Or by not dying?<br/><br/>Those are not all the same thing.<br/><br/>~90% of the rules in all the forms of D&amp;D are about tactical combat.<br/><br/>So there are basically 2 ways to deal with any given situation - engage with the system and have a tactical combat or ignore the system and talk. Because the system only effectively covers tactical combat, it highly incentivizes interacting in that way.<br/><br/>If death is really the consequence of failure, then the player is encouraged to avoid failure because failure is not fun. So you are not really incentivized to seek actual danger. You are seeking tactical combats that are weighted in your favor from the beginning. It's like a 3 year old playing a board game with their parents - they expect their parents to play at less than their maximum ability so that the kid will either win or at least be allowed to get much closer than they would if the parent were playing to slaughter them.<br/><br/>Some folks don't play like that. I know. But those are still the exceptions that prove the rule.<br/><br/>You don't go into each fight with a relatively even chance of not surviving it and needing to start a new character afterward.<br/><br/>In a game like Dogs in the Vineyard, for example, you go into a fight with a fairly good chance of getting some fallout. The odds are typically in your favor regarding pure survival, but you come out of it with consequences. And those consequences are a major source of the fun of the game. You are strongly incentivized to put your character in danger of facing fallout because fallout adds awesome stuff to the game.<br/><br/>When I run adventure style games, I remove death as the default negative end condition of combat - for both sides. Roughly 50% or so of the defeated NPCs survive - more or less depending on how appropriate it feels for the situation. This does a couple things. For one, the story of a fight continues after it is over - I get a lot more mileage out of each encounter, as the PCs decide what to do with the survivors afterward (my current players are a pretty moral group in a pretty realistic setting, so they don't just slit everyone's throat without a second thought). And secondly, it sets the stage for what would happen if the players lost a fight - they would be captured by their opponents, and the story would continue from there. So it removes combat failure as a full stop ending.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350206/#Comment_350206" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T16:39:05+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  4:39PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2011 4:39PM by JDCorley.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Personally, I'd say that playing<i>about</i>Sanity loss is more important than specifically playing<i>toward</i>Sanity loss.

Yech.  Could be a fluke, but this sort of thing seems typical of CoC accounts I've read online (and heard from friends).<br/><br/>My conclusion is that the current system of "GM + advice" is not optimal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350210/#Comment_350210" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T17:03:45+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  5:03PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2011 5:05PM by JDCorley.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah, it ain't perfect, that's for certain.

I've GM'd Cthulhu over a hundred times, it <i>is</i> failure-prone, and that's because the rules don't do a good job of channeling the fiction. The rules essentially tell non-GM players to spend an hour fussing over characters they're supposed to advocate for and protect. The advice for building color and planning plot/theme runs directly contrary to that. GMs wind up railroading the cast through their clue gauntlet, then "punishing" characters with unbeatable monsters and SAN loss because that's the only way to even touch them. My very favorite game in the whole hobby is not actually a good game, it pains me to relate. But it has a beautiful, perfect, elegant game hiding inside it!

So the fact that an abstraction like microbes lucked out and won doesn't really matter, because there are essentially no characters in that story anyway - just newsmen reading reports.<br/><br/>In character-driven stories, you expect the characters to make conscious actions that drive toward a positive outcome.<br/><br/>When you have character-as-avatar stories -- a la story games -- you expect the player who is making the decisions for the character to be enabled to make meaninful decisions.<br/><br/>There's 2 ways to do that.

It just means they've been captured and now you need to run an escape story or something.<br/><br/>And "not die" shouldn't be the primary victory condition of the vast majority of combat encounters.

Full stop. That's it, that's all.<br/><br/>Corley is viewing the game from the optimistic angle, where investigators attempt to stop the Mythos, because if you try to be on the Mythos' side, you run out of Sanity points in a hurry and can't play your character anymore. But as long as investigators survive and stay sane, they don't necessarily have to stop the Mythos. But they DO have to investigate the Mythos, unless the GM wants to write some adventures about non-Mythos stuff, which the game won't ever tell you how to do.<br/><br/>I don't know what edition you're looking at, but 4th and 5th editions don't tell you to make characters that will survive. They tell you to make characters that have whatever skills make sense for their profession, which should be one that will investigate the Mythos. I agree to some extent that the skills are unnecessary, and counter-intuitive, in that you spend a lot of time making a character who will die. But if you play the game the way every published adventure tells you to play it (which is how the game is supposed to be played), that issue is somewhat mitigated by building up to a climax (as opposed to D&amp;D, where the first thing that happens when the first monster is encountered can be a PC getting killed).<br/><br/>It could be tighter, and it could be better-targeted to its audience, but I'd say I've had more hours of fun and successful gaming (as GM and player) with CoC than any other game ever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350228/#Comment_350228" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T18:57:26+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  6:57PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know how anyone can argue with you, Colin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350232/#Comment_350232" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T19:49:39+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  7:49PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2011 8:14PM by ccreitz.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H.</cite>I don't know how anyone can argue with you, Colin.</blockquote> Madness, obviously.

But in play, it's never that simple, is it?  Players usually put more into their characters' pursuit than just, "I would like to witness the next thing."  For all I know, being pure spectators might be great, but people don't seem to do that.  They want to stop the evil, or join the evil, or have an emotionally intense experience, or rock out portrayals of madness.  And it tends to be unclear which of those will actually play well at a given table.  <br/><br/>A GM who wants to turn it into a hardcore puzzle-solving challenge totally can.  A GM who wants to trap the characters in a haunted house, push them around with powers beyond their comprehension, play for fright, and then eat them all, can do that too.  So which will it be?  I don't think the game does a good job of telling you.  There's extra work to be done in order to achieve group coherence and proper expectations.  Maybe your group did that extra work more successfully than Colin's?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350256/#Comment_350256" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T23:53:04+00:00" title="December  1, 2011 11:53PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoah, I never said it did a <i>good</i> job of explaining itself!<br/><br/>A lot of the stuff in CoC is legacy rules from earlier games, but the published adventures (most of the ones I ran and played anyway) didn't push towards hardcore puzzle-solving. They always made sure there were enough clues scattered around that the PCs would eventually end up at the horrible ceremony or the bad guys' lair. The problem with the rules is that the only thing that teaches you how to run CoC is the published adventures, and only by example.<br/><br/>And sure, most PCs are going to try and stop the Mythos activity. Because that's optimal behaviour--if you can't stop them, they'll destroy you, and if you join them, they'll destroy you. But it's not <i>required</i>. If you don't try and stop them, you can still play CoC, but if you don't investigate, you can't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350257/#Comment_350257" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T23:59:29+00:00" title="December  1, 2011 11:59PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2011 12:00AM by Wordman.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Is there a better game hiding in D&amp;D?</blockquote>\nIf there is, and if the central point of this thread is true, then the path may be to make more explicit the ridiculous ease with which people (and dragons and mind flayers, et. al.) can be brought back to life in D&amp;D.

You'd rather not lose them, but you could.<br/><br/>If the stakes are "If I lose, I don't get to participate in the rest of this years-long story anymore in the same way I've been doing." then the player isn't really willing to risk losing that, so the GM throws the gamble in their favor.<br/><br/>What D&amp;D is not very good at is helping players set other stakes and address those stakes in interesting ways using the system.<br/><br/>A skilled GM can do it.

So you've got to find the <i>right</i> modules.  <br/><br/>For those without the money and patience to go through that process, I'd say Colin's advice ("Pursue zero Sanity!") is a godsend.  It changes the game, curtailing some of its fine possibilities, but it also makes it playable.<br/><br/>I actually prefer my take on Sanity (and JD's latest one), but that's more words, harder to remember, and less obvious to act on.<br/><br/>Actually, hey, have we stumbled upon Chaosium's business model?  Publish a game with huge fictional appeal, fantastic color, the crappy BRP task resolution system that doesn't do anything important, and the idea that characters can lose Sanity.  Let groups struggle to figure out how to make that work.  Then, swoop in and save them with a module!  And another!  And another!  Once you get them hooked on the idea that modules are the best way to play Cthulhu (and Cthulhu is indeed awesome when played coherently), you've got a customer for life, and can even charge $75 for pimped-out books like Mountains of Madness which offer whole campaigns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350311/#Comment_350311" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-02T12:12:58+00:00" title="December  2, 2011 12:12PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interestingly, in the first few versions of D&amp;D; you get XP for every GP of treasure you collect as well.

You presumably have to specify where you search (cause there's no search skill that lets you find it by rolling dice). And you have to do things like gut every monster and search through their innards for swallowed gems. And strip every bandit you kill, hunting for coins sewn in to their breeches and crap.<br><br>Reading through those modules, I could see the game getting really really tedius, as you painstakingly disect every room and monster, looking for the hidden goodies.

Not only can the adventurer get shot with a crossbow 9 times without passing out, but he also have 100,000 times the wealth that the commoner has. And how do you have a rich non-adventurer, when wealth = experience levels? Do tax collectors get to throw fireballs?

I knock it down. The GM puts another obstacle in front of me. I knock down.<br/><br/>My only goal is really to be able to succeed at knocking down those obstacles. I'm not really driving toward anything in particular.<br/><br/>Maybe at some point in the course of a campaign, I've gotten invested in certain elements of the world enough that I want to actively pursue something. But for the most part, I'm just killing whatever target dummy the GM puts in front of me.<br/><br/>So the key is making really interesting obstacles. Things where "did I reduce it's hit points before it reduced mine" isn't the only thing going on.<br/><br/>But the game doesn't really help you with that very much. It just gives you things with hit points to stand in front of the players so they can knock them down. And some special powers to mix it up.<br/><br/>The most interesting of the old modules I've read up to this point is Keep on the Boarderlands. Because there's all kinds of interesting things you could do with the different factions in the Caves of Chaos - convince one group to help you fight another, etc. But there's no way in hell I'd run the scenario using straight up vanilla D&amp;D of any edition to run it. Cause there's nothing in the system that helps you engage with all that good content in an interesting way. Yes, you could just use lots of talking and GM fiat. Or you could use 3ed's crappy social skill rolls (which only let maybe 1 character in the party interact meaningfully with them), But how much cooler would it be to use a game system that actually addressed that sort of thing better? 4ed's skill challenges are a step in the right direction, (and there's some interesting ideas in that about using a group of different skills in creative ways toward a common goal), but it seems to be underdeveloped and poorly understood.<br/><br/>Which is sad, cause I think the 4ed skill challenges are probably the most interesting thing that D&amp;D has contributed to tabletop RPGs in a long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350322/#Comment_350322" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-02T13:25:15+00:00" title="December  2, 2011  1:25PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Captain Thark</cite><br/>The idea as I understand it was you'd start your career like Conan, stealing things.

Not because it's something my character is passionately interested in. Just because it's there. Because if I don't, what else am I going to do? Open a tavern? That may get me some loot, but I can't level up running a tavern, unless the GM sends me a steady stream of rowdy drunks to rough up and throw out the door.<br/><br/>The CHARACTER isn't driving toward anything. The GM is putting something in front of the character for him to knock down. Whatever the GM puts there, the character is going to react to.

The GM comes up with a storyline and then feeds it to you bit by bit. It's not purely passive by any means. You have opportunities to engage with it and shape it. But there is a level of passivity that entertainment consumers are comfortable with.<br/><br/>And for those who want to play in a very active way, you can do that. The game doesn't stop you from doing so (though the GM might - thus the term railroading).<br/><br/>It's just that the game doesn't force you to play in the most active way possible. Nor does it do much to really assist you in playing in a very active way. But it can be done.<br/><br/>So it serves a broad range of consumers reasonably well, which is a good formula for success - if by success you mean sales.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350333/#Comment_350333" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-02T15:06:11+00:00" title="December  2, 2011  3:06PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>Why?

That's fine.<br/><br/>My point is that I'm not actively driving toward anything. My goals are purely passive - I react to whatever shows up.<br/><br/>Sure, the GM can narrate some sort of "So you were going here because you wanted ___" that conveniently gets me to the right place at the right time for the thing he's going to plop down in front of me. But that's the GM telling me my goals. It's not driven by characterization at all.<br/><br/>"Be an adventurer" isn't a goal.<br/><br/>"Deal with what shows up" is a purely passive goal. And it's an anonymous goal. It doesn't matter who is there to deal with what shows up, as long as someone is there and they win, then the world is saved. Yay. Has zero to do with who the character is as a person (other than that key defining factor of "he's an adventurer" which is super silly anyway).<br/><br/>Sure, one character will deal with what shows up in a slightly different way than another will, based on their style or their strengths. But it's still an extremely passive mode of engaging with the world.<br/><br/>At least in Shadowrun, the motivation element is addressed directly. You are, in fact, doing it for the money.

Doesn't mean that they aren't goals just because they're reactive.  It's like saying Spiderman has no goals because he doesn't do crime prevention, he only tries to stop evildoers when they're already doing evil.<br/><br/>(And compare this to D&amp;D worlds like Midnight or Dark Sun where things aren't pretty okay.  Dark Sun in particular tended to fall down for me because I really didn't give a shit what happened to any of the shitty people that lived in their shitty world. Wanting to wipe it clean seemed to be a perfectly natural response to the situation.  In Midnight, by contrast, the core concept for your adventuring was to overthrow the evil overlords who had conquered the world. A dragon ravaging the countryside might not be such a bad thing if it meant you could use it as a distraction to bust some elf bros out of a prison camp or smear the local governor/dictator as ineffective.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350341/#Comment_350341" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-02T16:12:03+00:00" title="December  2, 2011  4:12PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But Spiderman has some character-driven goals. He wants to impress Mary Jane. But he wants to keep his identity secret so that the bad guys don't attack his family. And those two goals are at odds with each other, because it would be a lot easier to impress Mary Jane if she knew he was strong brave Spiderman. So when he puts on his mask and saves Mary Jane from the bad guy, he's got this conflict going on, cause he really wants Mary to know that it's Peter who's saving her, but if he did that he'd put her in danger. And that conflict drives decisions that he makes.<br/><br/>Spidey smacking some bad guy with some webbing is the situation, yeah, but the drama is coming from the character, not just the situation.<br/><br/>That's why Smallville is such an interesting way to do supers - because it's not about what powers you have. Powers are mostly flavor and scene framing. It's not about smacking down the baddie that the GM presents you with. It's about secrets and relationships and feelings and ideals and all that neat characterization stuff.<br/><br/>I would argue that Hero system doesn't really give you any tools to dig in to all that relationship play. It only measures efficacy (in absolutely excruciating detail). But Smallville is laser focused on the relationship play.<br/><br/>Hero helps you play the fight. It's all about the how.<br/><br/>Smallville helps you play what you're fighting about.

Similarly, things are okay, then a shitload of goblins show up and start killing villagers for their demon masters, and the adventurers go and stop them. Just because they're reactive doesn't mean they don't have goals/drives in the situation.  Defending the status quo is a big part of a lot of fantasy/adventure stories. We want to stop the Nazis from getting the Spear of Destiny and taking over the world. Solution: punch Nazis.<br/><br/>Yes, D&amp;D doesn't have any relationship mechanics. But that doesn't mean the characters don't have goals. It doesn't mean they aren't created with an expectation that they'll pursue adventuring goals (because we're playing D&amp;D and know it's about being adventurers), and with abilities that help them pursue adventuring goals (because character creation doesn't create innkeepers, it creates adventurers), and we'll have opportunities for adventure (because the GM stuff is about creating opportunity for adventure) and we'll chase after our adventuring goals and maybe win and progress, or maybe we don't win and we don't progress, and the tension of that is the tension of the game.  <br/><br/>D&amp;D's not a relationship game, it's an adventuring game, why would I make an adventurer and put them in an adventuring situation with adventuring goals and capabilities if what I wanted was relationship drama (or comedy)? Am I really stupid in this example, or...?

Because, usually, those fixes are about a problem that is not there.<br><br>The goal of CoC is not to see your PC die or go insane. Nowhere in the books is such thing stated. The goal of the game is to investigate some horrific problem and try to solve it. Emphasis on the"try." The rules try to emulate a world that is not kind to the PCs: no metagaming currency to steer things towards any resolution, harsh combat rules, and an insanity mechanic that simulates how people goes nuts in the literary source of the game (which has nothing to do with real life, by the way). There is nothing more than that, and I think that the attempts at 'fixing the game' are misguided, as is the pretense that people is not enjoying the game very much.<br><br>In the OP ccreitz says:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite><cite>From<i>Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</i></cite>Pilgrims get into trouble.</blockquote>\nGames like D&amp;D or Vampire, where getting your character killed really does reduce your ability to contribute to the fiction (rules as written), are fundamentally broken as potential literatures, because they incentivize players to "protect" characters, "advocating" for them. D&amp;D is a set of rules for making short, bearded Mary Sues. Vampire is a set of rules for making Mary Sues with heavy eye makeup.<br/><br/>I disagree, because I don't see why games should be potential literature. Actually, I think that any game will suck at that, and if you try to force it into being literature then you will have a sucky game. Then he adds:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>And then tells you, in a hundred pages of rules, to make a flawless immortal. It's great that it tells you that your character will get into dangerous situations and all, but that's just color. The mechanics agree: You've only succeeded when you've taken away the DM's ability to murder your guy. There are an even half dozen problems with that.</blockquote>\nThat is a very weird reading of any edition of D&amp;D, ever. The character succeeds by surviving the adventure in one way or other, either by defeating the threat or by fleeing, because then he can try another way of solving the problem, or just decide to go on with his life. You can never take away the DM ability to kill a PC.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>So there are basically 2 ways to deal with any given situation - engage with the system and have a tactical combat or ignore the system and talk. Because the system only effectively covers tactical combat, it highly incentivizes interacting in that way.<br/><br/>If death is really the consequence of failure, then the player is encouraged to avoid failure because failure is not fun. So you are not really incentivized to seek actual danger. You are seeking tactical combats that are weighted in your favor from the beginning. It's like a 3 year old playing a board game with their parents - they expect their parents to play at less than their maximum ability so that the kid will either win or at least be allowed to get much closer than they would if the parent were playing to slaughter them.<br/><br/>Some folks don't play like that. I know. But those are still the exceptions that prove the rule.</blockquote>\nExceptions don't prove the rule. Exceptions destroy a rule and make it invalid. And it's not "some folks", it's an awful lot of people. Part of the thrill of a D&amp;D game is knowing when to fight, when to flee, and when to talk. Just like in real life, an skilled player learns to weigh his chances.<br/><br/>Death does not need to be the default consequence of combat, not as a result of rules application, but because most people won't fight to death. The will flee or surrender when wounded or outmatched. My players don't go around with a "no prisoners" policy: combat is usually self-defense, and only to the minimum needed to fend off a threat. Sometimes they will take the initiative, but because I roll in the open and don't fudge they try to avoid combat, as they could die. No fixing of the game required. You just have to roleplay most characters as people with a normal reluctance to kill other people, unless they are hardened soldiers or utter psychopaths.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>That's a sensible reading, but how has that worked out, really?  I can't tell.  The amount the game sells and gets played would seem to attest to some level of success, but the number of dissatisfied play reports on the internet (and from my friends) makes it look failure-prone.<br/>Anecdotical evidence on the web is easily dismissed, because satisfied people tends to be a lot less vocal than angry people. So, it's to be expected that you will find more thread complaining about how CoC sucks balls, because the majority of happy players will be too busy playing the game.<br/><br/>Since I started reading indie RPGs messageboards I've got the strong impression that many fixes on traditional games are attempts to fix sucky GMs and groups, motivated by a bunch of anecdotical evidence that amounts to "I played a shitty game of X, therefore the game needs fixing."<br/><br/>It's OK not to like CoC for whatever reason, or to think there are better ways of playing a game of lovecraftian horror.

Because, usually, those fixes are about a problem that is not there.<br/><br/>The goal of CoC is not to see your PC die or go insane. Nowhere in the books is such thing stated. The goal of the game is to investigate some horrific problem and try to solve it. Emphasis on the"try." The rules try to emulate a world that is not kind to the PCs: no metagaming currency to steer things towards any resolution, harsh combat rules, and an insanity mechanic that simulates how people goes nuts in the literary source of the game (which has nothing to do with real life, by the way). There is nothing more than that, and I think that the attempts at 'fixing the game' are misguided, as is the pretense that people is not enjoying the game very much.<br/><br/>In the OP ccreitz says:<br/><br/><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite><cite>From<i>Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</i></cite>Pilgrims get into trouble.</blockquote>\nGames like D&amp;D or Vampire, where getting your character killed really does reduce your ability to contribute to the fiction (rules as written), are fundamentally broken as potential literatures, because they incentivize players to "protect" characters, "advocating" for them. D&amp;D is a set of rules for making short, bearded Mary Sues. Vampire is a set of rules for making Mary Sues with heavy eye makeup.<br/><br/>I disagree, because I don't see why games should be potential literature. Actually, I think that any game will suck at that, and if you try to force it into being literature then you will have a sucky game. Then he adds:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>And then tells you, in a hundred pages of rules, to make a flawless immortal. It's great that it tells you that your character will get into dangerous situations and all, but that's just color. The mechanics agree: You've only succeeded when you've taken away the DM's ability to murder your guy. There are an even half dozen problems with that.</blockquote>\nThat is a very weird reading of any edition of D&amp;D, ever. The character succeeds by surviving the adventure in one way or other, either by defeating the threat or by fleeing, because then he can try another way of solving the problem, or just decide to go on with his life. You can never take away the DM ability to kill a PC.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>So there are basically 2 ways to deal with any given situation - engage with the system and have a tactical combat or ignore the system and talk. Because the system only effectively covers tactical combat, it highly incentivizes interacting in that way.<br/><br/>If death is really the consequence of failure, then the player is encouraged to avoid failure because failure is not fun. So you are not really incentivized to seek actual danger. You are seeking tactical combats that are weighted in your favor from the beginning. It's like a 3 year old playing a board game with their parents - they expect their parents to play at less than their maximum ability so that the kid will either win or at least be allowed to get much closer than they would if the parent were playing to slaughter them.<br/><br/>Some folks don't play like that. I know. But those are still the exceptions that prove the rule.</blockquote>\nExceptions don't prove the rule. Exceptions destroy a rule and make it invalid. And it's not "some folks", it's an awful lot of people. Part of the thrill of a D&amp;D game is knowing when to fight, when to flee, and when to talk. Just like in real life, an skilled player learns to weigh his chances.<br/><br/>Death does not need to be the default consequence of combat, not as a result of rules application, but because most people won't fight to death. The will flee or surrender when wounded or outmatched. My players don't go around with a "no prisoners" policy: combat is usually self-defense, and only to the minimum needed to fend off a threat. Sometimes they will take the initiative, but because I roll in the open and don't fudge they try to avoid combat, as they could die. No fixing of the game required. You just have to roleplay most characters as people with a normal reluctance to kill other people, unless they are hardened soldiers or utter psychopaths.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>That's a sensible reading, but how has that worked out, really?  I can't tell.  The amount the game sells and gets played would seem to attest to some level of success, but the number of dissatisfied play reports on the internet (and from my friends) makes it look failure-prone.<br/>Anecdotical evidence on the web is easily dismissed, because satisfied people tends to be a lot less vocal than angry people. So, it's to be expected that you will find more thread complaining about how CoC sucks balls, because the majority of happy players will be too busy playing the game.<br/><br/>Since I started reading indie RPGs messageboards I've got the strong impression that many fixes on traditional games are attempts to fix sucky GMs and groups, motivated by a bunch of anecdotical evidence that amounts to "I played a shitty game of X, therefore the game needs fixing."<br/><br/>It's OK not to like CoC for whatever reason, or to think there are better ways of playing a game of lovecraftian horror.

There is nothing more than that, and I think that the attempts at 'fixing the game' are misguided, as is the pretense that people is not enjoying the game very much.<br/></blockquote>\nI think the main thing that some of the people are trying to say is that the game doesn't give you any mechanics-driven way to embrace your failures and make them fun.<br/><br/>Some more recent games help you do that. In Dogs in the Vineyard, you get fallout after a conflict, often even if you win. And that fallout adds good stuff to the roleplaying experience. In Smallville, you take stress after a conflict, and that stress adds good stuff to the roleplaying experience. So your failures are like successes in that they add to the fun of playing the game.<br/><br/>Trad games don't do this as well at the mechanical level. They don't inherently provide interesting feedback from failure, of if they do, they don't encourage players to embrace that and make that be the fun of the game.<br/><br/>CoC gives you some fun opportunities through the Sanity mechanic to have some fun experiences reacting poorly to situations. But ultimately you are discouraged by the system from embracing that, because the Sanity system is a death-spiral - once you lose Sanity, it's easier and easier to lose more, and it's really hard to get any back. So if you want to play a character for more than a one-shot game, the system encourages you to play ostrich-style with your head in the sand.<br/><br/>And I'm not saying that's the only way to play the game. I'm not saying you can't embrace the danger and be willing to let your character go crazy and go out of your control. I'm not saying you can't make it work and have tons of fun with it.<br/><br/>I'm saying that the rulebook and the system mechanics don't give you enough support toward doing that.<br/><br/>If the book said something like "As a player, you should push toward experiences that will drive your character insane even though it will force you to make a new one to continue the campaign, because that's where the fun is" and the book also made it super easy to stat up a new investigator in 5 minutes after the last one went batshit, then that would help players get to the fun more quickly and more consistently. The natural desire to make your character survive makes it hard to embrace that, and the book should provide more guidance in getting you to that state of being OK with losing control of your character through death or insanity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351479/#Comment_351479" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T12:49:00+00:00" title="December 14, 2011 12:49PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2011 12:50PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Imperator</cite>Exceptions don't prove the rule.

There aren't any fun chase mechanics in the core rules of any edition that I'm aware of. If you're fleeing, you're avoiding the encounter your GM created for you to engage with.<br/><br/>If you're talking, you're not engaging with the system. There aren't any good negotiation mechanics in any edition that I'm aware of. 3.5 had crappy skill checks. 4 has skill challenges that are sort of interesting but, as far as I've seen when seeing them discussed on forums, that's the part of the rules that is least understood and seems to be most often skipped.<br/><br/>So if you're talking or fleeing as a response to an encounter, one could perhaps argue that you're not really playing D&amp;D anymore. You're playing the game you've made up with your friends based on social contract and shared experiences about expectations within your group.<br/><br/>And I'm not saying that there isn't a long tradition of doing that. I'm just saying that the gamebook that you bought at the game store isn't what's guiding that part of your experience at the table. <br/><br/>Other gamebooks for more recent games (and older ones as well - James Bond had great chase mechanics, for example) have addressed those interactions much more effectively.<br/>\n<blockquote>Death does not need to be the default consequence of combat, not as a result of rules application, but because most people won't fight to death.

You just have to roleplay most characters as people with a normal reluctance to kill other people, unless they are hardened soldiers or utter psychopaths.</blockquote>\nAgain, I'm not saying you can't play the game this way. I'm not saying there aren't people who do so.<br/><br/>I'm saying that the game, Rules As Written, does not assist you in playing characters who aren't psychopathic killers.<br/><br/>The game does not provide guidelines, for example, for at what hit point level a given type of monster will be most likely ready to surrender.<br/><br/>In fact, in some editions, it does quite the opposite. As far as I can tell, being Bloodied in 4th ed is more likely to send a monster into a berzerker rage and become more powerful, rather than be ready to give up. And having bloodied targets makes it more likely that a PC can trigger a powerful attack and finish someone off.<br/><br/>Granted, I don't know 4th ed super well. My impressions may be incorrect. But that's what I've picked up about it.<br/><br/>And to me, that seems like the system is hugely decreasing the likelyhood of having an opponent surrender.<br/><br/>And if, as a GM, you had your bad guys surrendering after they got bloodied, you would be taking away some of your players' ability to use their cool powerz. And that would totally suck.<br/><br/>I may be missing something. There may be somewhere in the core texts where the game suggests that you have opponents surrender regularly, or just go unconscious and be easily healed and captured. But that's not anything that I've seen in the texts. And in the old modules I've been reading, they are way the heck more likely to give the GM information about what sort of treasures the players can find if they vivisect every giant leech they slaughter, rather than giving guidance about what sort of information a captured sentient can provide if interrogated (though it does occasionally happen - usually with a suggestion for how to rule on an interrogation, because the core game doesn't provide easy rules for that).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimD" title="JimD"><img alt="JimD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimD">JimD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351505/#Comment_351505" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T15:14:25+00:00" title="December 14, 2011  3:14PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pardon the brief tangent, but I just wanted to let everyone know that this thread inspired me to remove death as a stake from the action game I'm working on.

The GM says what other beings decide to do or say.<br/><br/>This is not failing to engage the system, it is engaging a different part of the system: the GM.<br/><br/>I don't see how having a book that says the game will have a GM, and even often a whole separate book helping GMs GM is the book "not helping" with that system.<br/><br/>And this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>But ultimately you are discouraged by the system from embracing that, because the Sanity system is a death-spiral - once you lose Sanity, it's easier and easier to lose more, and it's really hard to get any back.</blockquote>\n...is just flat untrue.  Successfully completing adventures gave you Sanity back. And eventually you couldn't lose more Sanity for seeing similar horrors again. Like, no matter how long you played, you could never lose more than 6 Sanity for seeing human corpses.  You could never lose more than... 6 for looking at Deep Ones? Maybe 8.  And so on.  And you could regain that Sanity and then some if you defeated them.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>I'm saying that the game, Rules As Written, does not assist you in playing characters who aren't psychopathic killers.</blockquote>\nSure it does.

I don't see that as a failure of the game, because I don't think you need to be engaging the system at all times.

Thanks for giving me further insight.<br/><br/>I do, however, see a tendency among players to have a hard time embracing the danger that their player knows is present but their character knows nothing of. As players, they say things like "Oooh. A scary looking book. We better not read it or we'll go crazy."<br/><br/>So part of what the OP was saying is - how can we help the players get over that and embrace the adventure? One way to do that is to say that your goal as a player is to dive right in and revel in the insanity because that's where the fun stuff is. <br/><br/>It's the same as when a game like Fiasco starts off with the premise that, most likely, nobody is going to come out of the scenario ahead of the game. Even if you manage to fulfil your primary goal, you'll suffer lots of consequences in the process, because that's where the fun of the game is. Everything is SUPPOSED to go horribly wrong.<br/><br/>In CoC, you're supposed to get at least a little unhinged. You're supposed to see something and get freaked out and run away from it, rather than facing it like a stoic hero and kicking it's ass. You're supposed to find your grandma eviscerated by otherworldly horrors and go puke in a bucket in response. Cause that's the kind of scenario you're engaging with.<br/><br/>I'm just saying it would be helpful if the mechanics and/or the rules text did more to help you embrace that as a player. In the old edition I read, they did a little of that, but more would help.\n<blockquote>Also, regarding fun consequences of failure. I think is more a matter of techniques than rules. After all, nothing on CoC rules prevents you from setting stakes each time you roll, or from agreeing on interesting consequences for failure beforehand. It's more a technique than a rule, IMO.</blockquote>But good technique can be baked right in to the rules.<br/><br/>It's not about "nothing prevents you from being an awesome GM". It's about "not enough is there to help you be an awesome GM". That's my criticism.\n<blockquote>I think that it boils down to your GMing philosophy when running D&amp;D.

But is not the only way of playing D&amp;D, and I would say that is not the most popular (specially among old-schoolers).</blockquote>I've been reading very old modules. Keep on the Borderlands. Village of Hommlet. Saltmarsh. Dunwater. Stuff like that. The encounter structure is a little less railroaded than it is in 4th ed design, but everything is still designed in bite-sized, "encounter" chunks, which are often pretty linear, though sometimes they aren't. You go to a room. There's stuff in it. From there, you go to the next room. There's something else there. Some things occasionally react and move around, but a lot of it is "there's a giant tick here that attacks one of the players randomly". The linear encounter focus of 4 ed writing is primarily an attempt to fine tune that into something that feels more cohesive - and there's a lot to be said for that. Random giant crayfishes and carnivorous frogs that aren't tied to the rest of the location in a very meaningful way other than "it's a moathouse, so there's some aquatic things there, but they're huge so you can fight them" feels kind of wonky. Plus, the encounter system makes it more likely that you have interesting, appropriately challenging fights, rather than "there's 2 smallish giant lizards here" followed by "there's 12 guards, plus 2 leader types, and in the next room, there's 8 more guys and the big boss who will probably run in if they here a fight happening".<br/><br/>I get what you're saying with "part of the skill of playing the game well is knowing how to address encounters like that". But there's nothing setting up that humongous fight in the moathouse outside of Hommlet. No reasonable reason other than hyper paranoia why the players would be carefully scouting out each and every single solitary room to make sure they see that overwhelming group. And there's nothing to make the encounter winnable by a small group, even if you do run the first time. I guess you could run back to town and mobilize the entire militia and every hireable NPC and bring all of them back for a 20 vs 20 throwdown. But dear god, D&amp;D's combat mechanics are nowhere near streamlined enough to make that fight fun. I wouldn't want to play it without something like Savage Worlds at least.\n<blockquote>In BECMI D&amp;D (the edition I'm most familiar with) there are rules for fleeing an encounter. Fun or not fun may be more of a matter of tastes. And fleeing from the encounter is an acceptable outcome that can provide interesting consequences.

Do you roll against your Dex or something?\n<blockquote>I understand that if you are talking you are not engaging with the system, but the same can be said of a conversation in Dogs in the Vineyard, for example.

I don't think you need to engage the system for something like that, unless there's a potentially interesting wrinkle happening, like you're asking for directions in a place where you don't know the language or customs well, or if you're in a hostile situation. Like if you were a dark elf in Skyrim arriving in Windhelm and asking directions of a Nord (there's a heavy racial tension element in that city in the game - dark elves live in a segregated ghetto.)<br/><br/>I'm talking about significant, dramatic stuff. Dogs provides you with tools for building a situation chock-full of significant dramatic stuff. And then it provides you with tools for having escalating conflicts surrounding those dramatic problems. And then it gives you tools for creating interesting fallout that can occur as you press your point.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that every system needs to have Dogs' escalation system for characters talking. But something better than pure GM fiat, or 3.5's screwy level-driven skill system, or 4's skill checks that most players and GMs seem to have trouble using effectively and usually skip, would help.<br/><br/>Even just the social skills in Savage Worlds would be an improvement. They give you a skill check that works like the rest of the skills in the game. Plus, they let you make social roles during combat to do creative things like distract opponents, which lets a highly social character help the highly physical characters with combat. We've been having tons of fun with that in the group I've been playing with for the past year.\n<blockquote>I can see how an adventure that says "The PCs need a successful Credit roll to access the records" may not be the kind of system you enjoy, of course. But there is a system with several skills for your PC to use in interactions.</blockquote>Using a skill system for the primary purpose of blocking access to important information is pretty much the least awesome way that skills can be used.<br/><br/>Giving the players the most critical information, and then letting them use skill checks as one way to follow up on that information and get extra details or implement the info in an interesting way is much better. Especially if failure at using the skills isn't just "nothing happens" but "now bad but interesting things happen". And those are things that can be baked in to how skill use is described and structured in the rulebook. Sure, great GM technique can do that too. But wouldn't it be great if the book gave the GM more of what they need to make awesome happen, rather than needing to spend 10 years assembling techniques on their own?<br/><br/>I know the book can't do everything. But it can do some.\n<blockquote>One thing is to say "this game has not effective and fun rules for this important part of it" (which I can agree), and other is to say that if you flee from an encounter you ar enot playing the game, specially when a very important part of mastering the game is knowing when to run.</blockquote>\nWhen do you run?<br/><br/>When your character is scared because he's facing something horrifically ugly and nasty? <br/> - D&amp;D doesn't have any rules for helping you decide when that is. CoC does, which is one of it's major draw points, though it's also an element that has been heavily addressed by games that try to improve on it.<br/><br/>When it would be an awesome place in the story to have an exciting chase scene? <br/> - Not likely. Neither game does chase scenes well, which is unfortunate, cause chase scenes are often great parts of adventure stories and horror stories.<br/><br/>When, as a player, you have calculated that the odds of defeating the monsters you are facing, whose stats you have memorized from the Monster Manual, are less than acceptable, given your current levels, builds, gear, etc. and you know that the GM is just going to make you roll up new characters if you fail? <br/> - Now you're playing a stats-based board game of pass/fail tactics. Where's the character-driven fun in that? I'm not running because Malthor the Fearless wants to run, I'm running because Rob the Accountant has decided that our group is not statistically prepared to maximize the output of this encounter. Is that what player mastery of the game looks like?\n<blockquote>I'm saying that the game, Rules As Written, does not assist you in playing characters who aren't psychopathic killers.<blockquote>I don't understand which kind of mechanical help is needed, to be honest, if we're talking about CoC.</blockquote></blockquote>\nNaw. CoC is fine in regards to psycopaths. The near modern setting and the lack of effectiveness of weaponry in dealing with many of the threats helps regulate that plenty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351599/#Comment_351599" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-15T14:28:30+00:00" title="December 15, 2011  2:28PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reply split.

Like I said, they spend much more time telling you that if you eviscerate the giant ants, you'll find a couple gems in the stomach of one of them, which provides specific explicit rewards for being soulless killers but provides no rewards for being merciful and thoughtful.<br/><br/>Most of the old modules were written that way. There are some rare exceptions, but orcs and goblinoids and gnolls and such are usually presented as mindless thugs who have nothing worthwhile to say if you talk to them. There are exceptions. <br/><br/>Keep on the Borderlands has an interesting ecosystem of interconnected groups, though it is critically missing any sense of how to get started in talking your way through any of the encounters rather than just treating it as a series of rooms to systematically clear. But there is a good bit to work with if the GM decides they want to play up that aspect. Or, a very very proactive group could potentially approach the caves with the sense that they wanted to try to negotiate if possible, and could take that route. But, again, if you do that, you have to almost completely forego making use of your character and the awesome combat abilities that they have. You might as well just turn over your character sheet and put your dice away if you're going to approach that module that way. And, yes, I think that's a fault in the system when it gives you no beefy mechanical hooks to use to engage with a situation through dialog. Sure - a really good GM could make a ton of fun out of it. But if so, they're doing lots and lots of creative work to make that happen. Using any of a list of other game systems, the system would do a lot of heavy lifting toward making the encounter more interesting.<br/><br/>Imagine if the entirety of combat in D&amp;D was just "make one roll and add your Kill Things stat, and if you beat a 7, you win, otherwise you die". No special attacks. No bonuses or penalties. No differentiating between killing with a bow or a sword or a spell. Just Kill Things. If you stip out all the mechanical crunchy fun completely, then combat loses all that engaging crunchy fun that it has. All those rewards that it gives you - the rewards of leveling up and getting more attacks and hit points, the reward of engaging with a tactical challenge and overcoming it, etc.<br/><br/>Wouldn't it be neat if you could participate in other sorts of challenges with that same sort of system-enhanced engagement? Wouldn't it be neat if negotiating with the gnolls let you roll some skills, have some unexpected but always interesting outcomes, reward you both with tactical engagement and character advancement, etc?<br/><br/>I think it would be neat. So do some others. They've written some really neat games because of it.<br/><br/>I think it would be neat if D&amp;D would learn a bit more from what all has been done in the industry in the past 35+ years. They've learned a lot, sure. 4 ed has a lot of really neat advancements. They've done a lot of neat work toward helping GMs put together a game (as long as they're willing to pay the subscription fee to use the online tools they provide).<br/><br/>But I think they could do a little more, right at the core.<br/><br/>Or not. They could just continue to create a tactical combat game that people just happen to make up stories around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351607/#Comment_351607" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-15T17:24:07+00:00" title="December 15, 2011  5:24PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think given that they have only rarely fallen below the "supermajority of sales, players and play" level in the hobby, probably D&amp;D will continue to do all right in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351610/#Comment_351610" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-15T18:55:31+00:00" title="December 15, 2011  6:55PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And American Idol is the most popular show on TV. Does that automatically mean that it represents the pinacle of achievement in script writing, acting, special effects, choreography, editing, etc? Of course not. People watch it because of the magical combination of rooting for the small amount of actual talent present mixed with the train wreck of watching people who think they can sing even though they sound like a cat in heat at best.<br/><br/>Yes it's popular. That's why it call attention to it's flaws. I'm not pointing out the flaws in MERP cause I don't care and the 50 people that play it are perfectly happy. I'm pointing out the flaws in D&amp;D precisely because it is the first and sadly often the only roleplaying game that the vast majority of people experience. Therefore the benefit from potetially improving it is huge.<br/><br/>And it does improve. 4 is better than 3 is better than 2 is better than 1 in many many ways.

Thanks for giving me further insight.</blockquote>\nContrary to most Internet wisdom, I think that CoC is a game that really shines in a long-term game. It plays nicely for one-shots, but the depth of the SAN rules and their interaction with the Mythos skill and the spells can only be appreciated after several games.\n<blockquote>So part of what the OP was saying is - how can we help the players get over that and embrace the adventure? One way to do that is to say that your goal as a player is to dive right in and revel in the insanity because that's where the fun stuff is.<br/><br/>It's the same as when a game like Fiasco starts off with the premise that, most likely, nobody is going to come out of the scenario ahead of the game. Even if you manage to fulfil your primary goal, you'll suffer lots of consequences in the process, because that's where the fun of the game is. Everything is SUPPOSED to go horribly wrong.<br/><br/>In CoC, you're supposed to get at least a little unhinged. You're supposed to see something and get freaked out and run away from it, rather than facing it like a stoic hero and kicking it's ass. You're supposed to find your grandma eviscerated by otherworldly horrors and go puke in a bucket in response. Cause that's the kind of scenario you're engaging with.<br/><br/>I'm just saying it would be helpful if the mechanics and/or the rules text did more to help you embrace that as a player. In the old edition I read, they did a little of that, but more would help.</blockquote>\nIt is a perfectly fine opinion, and I agree at least partially. This turtling behaviour indeed happens sometimes with some players, but not too much in my experience. I like how, for example, Trail of Cthulhu gives a PC some Motivations to poke into eldritch stuff, and I think is an idea worth exploring.<br/><br/>OTOH, I also agree with JDCorley: when you create a PC in CoC, it should be clearly agreed that you will create someone that will be willing to delve in this stuff and take what it comes. But I think that is more a matter of group dynamics and GM presentation than of rules. Though I agree that there could be a more clear explanation of that in the GMing section of the books - most GMing advice is not very good anyway, IMO - I hesitate to attribute that to rules.<br/><br/>Also, I find awesome to not know if I will be able to fight the Mythos monster and save my friends or if I will only be able to puke in a bucket. That is what I like about SAN rolls, I think they contribute to the feeling of indefension the game strives to create.\n<blockquote>I've been reading very old modules. Keep on the Borderlands. Village of Hommlet. Saltmarsh. Dunwater. Stuff like that. The encounter structure is a little less railroaded than it is in 4th ed design, but everything is still designed in bite-sized, "encounter" chunks, which are often pretty linear, though sometimes they aren't.</blockquote>\nPublixhed adventures will always be a mixed bag in any game, to be honest, and I see what you mean.Anyway, I am one of those GMs wh think that, when it comes to fantasy, cohesion and ecologies and all that stuff are waaaaay overrated. And I like the exploration for the sake of it, even if it has no thematic meaning or lacks a story behind, and the only maningufl decisions are related to the exploration.\n<blockquote>Are the BECMI fleeing rules tied in well with the stats? Do you roll against your Dex or something?</blockquote>\nYep, they're also tied to your movement rate, and if you use diversion tactics like throwing food to non-intelligent monsters or some other bait to intelligent creatures they may break pursuit. \n<blockquote>I'm not talking about asking for directions. I don't think you need to engage the system for something like that, unless there's a potentially interesting wrinkle happening, like you're asking for directions in a place where you don't know the language or customs well, or if you're in a hostile situation. Like if you were a dark elf in Skyrim arriving in Windhelm and asking directions of a Nord (there's a heavy racial tension element in that city in the game - dark elves live in a segregated ghetto.)<br/><br/>I'm talking about significant, dramatic stuff. Dogs provides you with tools for building a situation chock-full of significant dramatic stuff. And then it provides you with tools for having escalating conflicts surrounding those dramatic problems. And then it gives you tools for creating interesting fallout that can occur as you press your point.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that every system needs to have Dogs' escalation system for characters talking. But something better than pure GM fiat, or 3.5's screwy level-driven skill system, or 4's skill checks that most players and GMs seem to have trouble using effectively and usually skip, would help.<br/><br/>Even just the social skills in Savage Worlds would be an improvement. They give you a skill check that works like the rest of the skills in the game. Plus, they let you make social roles during combat to do creative things like distract opponents, which lets a highly social character help the highly physical characters with combat. We've been having tons of fun with that in the group I've been playing with for the past year.</blockquote>\nAs I am unfamiliar with Savage Worlds, I will take your word for it and accept that they make a good set of rules for social interaction. Definitely, social conflict and social interaction have been a weak point in RPGs design like, forever. I will check them out. I use some house rules in BRP to fix social situations that have worked pretty well but I will agree, the book does not give much options other than "success / failure".\n<blockquote>Using a skill system for the primary purpose of blocking access to important information is pretty much the least awesome way that skills can be used.<br/><br/>Giving the players the most critical information, and then letting them use skill checks as one way to follow up on that information and get extra details or implement the info in an interesting way is much better. Especially if failure at using the skills isn't just "nothing happens" but "now bad but interesting things happen". And those are things that can be baked in to how skill use is described and structured in the rulebook. Sure, great GM technique can do that too. But wouldn't it be great if the book gave the GM more of what they need to make awesome happen, rather than needing to spend 10 years assembling techniques on their own?</blockquote>\nI certainly agree on this, no doubt.\n<blockquote>When do you run?</blockquote>\nFor many people, specially those who are more into immersion, when they think their character would based on what the PC knows about the monster, is personality and all that. Many gamers resent having rules that tell them "now you are scared." It's not my case, but s really common. For many persons, mastery of the game equals being able to decide based on your character motivations and knowledge.\n<blockquote>I think it would be neat if D&amp;D would learn a bit more from what all has been done in the industry in the past 35+ years. They've learned a lot, sure. 4 ed has a lot of really neat advancements. They've done a lot of neat work toward helping GMs put together a game (as long as they're willing to pay the subscription fee to use the online tools they provide).<br/><br/>But I think they could do a little more, right at the core.<br/><br/>Or not. They could just continue to create a tactical combat game that people just happen to make up stories around.</blockquote>\nYes, it would be interesting. But I think that the game being as wildly successful as is, in any of its incarnations (all of them are played to this day), makes that a bad business decision.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>I'm pointing out the flaws in D&amp;D precisely because it is the first and sadly often the only roleplaying game that the vast majority of people experience. Therefore the benefit from potetially improving it is huge.</blockquote>\nOr you can end alienating a lot of the current gamers without bringing any significant amount of new gamers.\n<blockquote>And it does improve. 4 is better than 3 is better than 2 is better than 1 in many many ways. It's just kind of upsetting to me that the pace of improvement is so glacial. And there are elements that are intentionally left in despite how horrible they are (class+level).</blockquote>\nI disagree profoundly on this statement. I don't think that the 4th improves significantly the game, and is my least favourite version of it. I find it bland, uninteresting and focused only in fiddly bits that leave non-gamers and gamers alike scratching their heads. The success of previous editions of the game seems to indicate to me that they were more suitable to bring people into the hobby, even if they ended witching to other games later.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clint Krause</cite>Maybe we could "fix"<i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>by adding a tactical positioning system and mechanics that reflect accurate stats for various real world firearms.<br/><br/>OR we could accept that people have diverse tastes and playstyles and celebrate that instead of engaging in all this "one true way" stuff.

Serously.</blockquote>\nThe majority of big print published roleplaying games have a section, usually in the first couple pages but sometimes after a big flavor short story. It's titled What is Roleplaying, or something very similar. And the vast majority of them say something to the effect of "Roleplaying is like when you played Cops and Robbers or Cowboys and Indians as a kid. You'd make up scenarios and pretend to shoot at each other. But then you'd argue and say 'No, you didn't shoot me'. Roleplaying games let you play like that and make up stories, but we give you rules to help you decide who got shot."<br/><br/>Granted, there were some variations on that, but I saw that same basic explanation in like 15 different places.<br/><br/>So, at it's core, roleplaying games are a way of saying "Your game is broken. Here's a better way to do it."<br/><br/>Being critical of how others play and looking at ways to improve on that is at the core of why RPGs exist in the first place.<br/><br/>Just cause you don't agree with me doesn't mean you have to eliminate my right to criticize with "A million happy users can't be wrong" arguments.<br/><br/>It has been my experience that many players of D&amp;D start out lacking the tools to do a lot of things effectively, like have an interesting character argument that doesn't rely 100% on social contract to be resolved satisfactorily. And it is my opinion that D&amp;D could do a better job of addressing that. It is my opinion that D&amp;D tends to set a stake of "death" too often as the consequence of failure, and doesn't give enough guidance to GMs and players about how to set other stakes in a conflict, and that because of that, people do things like underpower the opposition or fudge rolls because they don't want death to actually happen to the characters. It is my opinion that those issues should be better addressed, and that they are a consistant, recurring issue with people playing the game - not all people have those issues, but a significant number do.<br/><br/>And because the game represents the vast supermajority of players and games, there are a vast number of players who never get satisfactory resolution regarding those issues, because they either never find out about other games that address those issues more effectively or they can't find a group to explore other games with. I myself have struggled for almost 30 years to find a group interested in playing anything other than D&amp;D, Shadowrun, Hero, or GURPS, other than playing at conventions with people who live too far for me to meet up with more regularly.<br/><br/>So, yes, for my own selfish reasons, I wish D&amp;D addressed those things in a way that made me more happy.<br/><br/>And no, I don't think that that means that nobody has figured out how to have tons of fun with it.<br/><br/>I'm just talking about things that I think are consistent, though not universal, points of challenge that could, potentially, be addressed through design. But they probably never will be. And that makes me a little grumpy and sad.<br/><br/>Ok. So here's a thing. People all the time on lots of forums and stuff talk about how they fudge dice rolls as GM while playing D&amp;D, because they don't like the outcome they see and don't think it will be fun. Does that maybe mean that the game is broken if it consistently produces results that players find unfun and feel the need to fix?<br/><br/>For purposes of answering this question, temporarily ignore those who play with all rolls out in the open and happily embrace chance-driven character death and find it enjoyable when a kobold with a crossbow kills their first level character before he gets anywhere in his career. Let's not assume that they're the ones who are playing the game right and that the ones who fudge rolls are just selfish gits who are playing the game wrong. Let's assume that the ones who fudge rolls are trying really hard to have fun playing this game, and that they genuinely think it's totally more fun to have someone succeed even though the rules say they were supposed to fail and die.<br/><br/>Cause I don't know about you, but I see tons and tons of cases where GMs say "Oh, and I just fudged the roll because it was supposed to kill that player and I didn't want that to happen." In fact, it appears to me that the majority of GMs do that. And GMs that don't are often considered to be unnecessarily cruel.<br/><br/>To me, that's an indicator that something is broken, when the majority of users use it incorrectly on purpose in order to correct for a perceived error.<br/><br/>I may be wrong in thinking that it's a majority, but I hear it so darn consistently that I have a hard time thinking that it's otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351681/#Comment_351681" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-16T12:16:52+00:00" title="December 16, 2011 12:16PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh. And don't think that I hold other games up as examples of perfection.<br/><br/>I think the skills under stats thing in Savage Worlds is done a little badly (I hate "unskilled" skill checks), so I run with a tweak that changes it a little. And some of the ways they group lots of abilities under one skill and then make other things super granular is really silly, but my tweak addresses that at the same time.<br/><br/>So it's not that I think that the game is perfect. But it gives me more to work with. Interesting tactical combat, but much faster and with much less bookeeping. Options for socially-focused characters that work both in and out of combat. Nice tools for other sorts of action scenes, like chases. Room for wacky creative player input through benny points. And I'm not saying that you can't do any of these things with D&amp;D. But I feel like they're more effectively baked in with SW.<br/><br/>So I've been running a game that's pretty strongly grounded in old style (or new old style, or whatever) D&amp;D. I'm using a group of old D&amp;D modules as my core resource, setting the locations next to each other. And I'm running a pretty reactionary, sandboxy type of setting - there's lots of things for the players to encounter, so whenever they ask an NPC about stuff to do, there's stuff to find out about.<br/><br/>So I've swapped out the D&amp;D stats for SW ones that are pretty equivilant. And I've reduced the gold count dramatically, because I'm using near-poverty as a major driver for the characters to give them a reason to adventure.<br/><br/>So, to me, it feels like a "fixed" version of D&amp;D play. I've gotten way more fun out of it than I've had trying to play using D&amp;D as the core rules system. But the play structures are extremely traditional - the home village is Hommlet, with the moathouse down the river. Up the river is the haunted house from Saltmarsh. Over in the hills are the Caves of Chaos from Keep on the Borderlands. Down the coast is the lizardman cave from Danger at Dunwater. And the Dwellers of the Forbidden City are in the nearby mountainous region.<br/><br/>So we're having some old school fun. I've picked the most reasonable and cohesive of the old modules I've found, and tweaked some of the inhabitants to fit with the slightly different world I'm using and to create a hair more consistency (no need to have 9 different kinds of sentient monsters when 5 gives me all the variation I need). And it's been a blast. Way more fun than I've had in any attempt to run a campaign using D&amp;D as the rules core.<br/><br/>So, yeah, as far as I can tell, it feels broken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351687/#Comment_351687" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-16T12:41:53+00:00" title="December 16, 2011 12:41PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>4 is better than 3 is better than 2 is better than 1 in many many ways.</blockquote>\nIs this commonly held?

People like Pathfinder and d20 games.<br/><br/>The second largest is probably the ones who think 4 is best. I mean, the game still sells, and those 4E boardgames are pretty dope.<br/><br/>Third largest is the ones who think 1 is best, if your idea of 1 is OD&amp;D, BECMI, and 1st edition AD&amp;D. The OSR is fairly vocal, though I might be biased.<br/><br/>The smallest group of people is the ones who think 2nd edition AD&amp;D is best. I have very little idea who these people actually are, but there are some. It seems to me that most of the people who think 2 is better than 1 also think 3 is better than 2.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351700/#Comment_351700" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-16T14:07:36+00:00" title="December 16, 2011  2:07PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            4th ed has, in it's main books, a lot more solid structure that makes it much easier to pick it up and play it as written. However, 4th ed also makes the first departure away from some of the longheld D&amp;D design structures, such as complicated Vancian magic resource allocation vs. Fighters who mostly just roll to-hit (though 3rd ed feats add a bit to that). Early 4th ed made all the classes play much more similar to each other, though from what I've heard, more differentiation showed up later, though I haven't kept up quite enough to know for certain. But because of those departures, there are many who avoid it, saying "that's not D&amp;D".<br/><br/>3rd ed took a lot of the annoying complicated counterintuitive stuff from previous editions and straightened it out so that it was easier to make sense out of. They made it so you always want to roll high and flipped everything around so that would work and be much cleaner. So there's a big group of people who like that it cleaned up the mechanics without varying the core structures much.<br/><br/>I haven't gone back and given a really critical look at 1ed vs 2ed, though some of the bits I've seen in some of the first books are really pretty messy. So I think there's a lot of rose-coloring and nostalgia that goes on when people embrace some of the really early stuff.<br/><br/>That being said, it sounds like I need to give the early Red Box a reread. That was the first one I owned, back in about 5th or 6th grade, but I never got anyone to play it. I had extremely poor leadership skills in my school days. I played through that lion castle solo adventure that came with it several times, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351729/#Comment_351729" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-16T17:03:19+00:00" title="December 16, 2011  5:03PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Imperator</cite>Contrary to most Internet wisdom, I think that CoC is a game that really shines in a long-term game. It plays nicely for one-shots, but the depth of the SAN rules and their interaction with the Mythos skill and the spells can only be appreciated after several games.</blockquote> You win only one internet, because this is right given BRP CoC as written, but... Suppose you had a game where you get to run the SAN-Mythos-spell cycle many times per session, and Mythos was high enough to matter to both SAN and effective investigation. Wouldn't that be better? I'm pretty sure it would.<br/><br/>So: Increase all listed Mythos gains by a factor of 2, or maybe even 3, so that it starts mattering right away. You never fail at reading a book - instead, choose some consequences that are less stupid than "you stare at it for a few weeks and nothing happens". There, fixed! You can get the experience of being able to effectively use your Mythos skill, and having it matter to your SAN, right from the first exposure. Oh, and at 0 SAN or 0HP, you win, and you get there by revealing Terrible Secrets. That's still the first rule.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Imperator</cite>OTOH, I also agree with JDCorley: when you create a PC in CoC, it should be clearly agreed that you will create someone that will be willing to delve in this stuff and take what it comes. But I think that is more a matter of group dynamics and GM presentation than of rules. Though I agree that there could be a more clear explanation of that in the GMing section of the books - most GMing advice is not very good anyway, IMO - I hesitate to attribute that to rules.</blockquote> ...this, I don't think so much. Why can't the rules give the GM direction on their own? Certainly, the GM advice in the BRP books is terrible, but instead of swapping in better GM advice - say, the d20 Cthulhu book's - why not refactor the rules to constrain the Keeper, just like everyone else at the table? If there's a way (or several) to run the game that works, why not just make it (them) part of the game? There's a better way forward for Cthulhu, and it runs past <i>Storming the Wizard's Tower</i>, which despite its glaring flaws as a game is a mind-blowing text, in particular when it's understood to be an investigative system rather than the rules for yet another D&amp;Desque fantasy adventure RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Imperator" title="Imperator"><img alt="Imperator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/569/nUS8BD26ISIQN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Imperator">Imperator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351736/#Comment_351736" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-16T18:43:05+00:00" title="December 16, 2011  6:43PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clint Krause</cite>Same here.

But there is a lot of middle ground between "this game is a jewel of flawless design and you cannot criticize it ever" and "this game is broken and everyone who plays it is unhappy and brain damaged." I was expressing a partial disagreement with some of your ideas, nothing more. By all means, criticize to your heart's content, it is possible that we find very good ideas through that.\n<blockquote>I'm just talking about things that I think are consistent, though not universal, points of challenge that could, potentially, be addressed through design.

Thing is, after many years of psychology I don't see that happening.\n<blockquote>Cause I don't know about you, but I see tons and tons of cases where GMs say "Oh, and I just fudged the roll because it was supposed to kill that player and I didn't want that to happen." In fact, it appears to me that the majority of GMs do that. And GMs that don't are often considered to be unnecessarily cruel.</blockquote>\nThat could be the case but, problem is, we cannot know for certain. We cannot know if people are really struggling like you did. Maybe they are. Mabe they aren't.<br/><br/>It's true that a lot of people do that.

But it gives me more to work with. Interesting tactical combat, but much faster and with much less bookeeping. Options for socially-focused characters that work both in and out of combat. Nice tools for other sorts of action scenes, like chases. Room for wacky creative player input through benny points. And I'm not saying that you can't do any of these things with D&amp;D. But I feel like they're more effectively baked in with SW.</blockquote>\nFair enough.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>You win only one internet, because this is right given BRP CoC as written, but...

The largest group of RPG players is also the largest group of D&amp;D players. It's not even close.  A sub-group of D&amp;D players is larger than everything else happening in the hobby, period. This is not an accident. D&amp;D is a very flexible game and it has a lot of good things about it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Why can't the rules give the GM direction on their own?

They are given to the Keeper because being a good Keeper is a fun skill to develop and very rewarding to improve on over time.  This is not a design mistake.  Limiting them to eliminate mistakes can also eliminate the freedom to make those mistakes and mechanizing the position makes it, well, mechanical.  The game can greatly benefit from having a creative director. It is not a mistake to include that position.<br/><br/>And this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>It has been my experience that many players of D&amp;D start out lacking the tools to do a lot of things effectively, like have an interesting character argument that doesn't rely 100% on social contract to be resolved satisfactorily.</blockquote>\n...is also not a mistake.

Ergo, it makes sense for the mechanics of an STG to incentivize sanity loss: It will encourage you to create stories in which your character will go insane (while, presumably, the character himself is resisting).<br/><br/>But if you pull the same trick in an RPG, what you'll end up with is a character who yearns for insanity. And, as you note, that doesn't actually make for an effective story or character.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>The first step to freeing that game from its shackles is to agree that if everyone dies or goes insane, that's actually a good and appropriate thing, way better than the alternative. There, I fixed it for you!</blockquote>\nSomething which is probably under-emphasized in the CoC rulebook -- but nonetheless essential for the game to succeed -- is that you create <i>investigators</i>. In other words, the primary goal of the character is <i>to investigate</i>. If curiosity is not a major part of the character that you create, then you will almost certainly run into problems unless the GM can find other ways to incentivize the investigation.<br/><br/>Similarly, the traditional D&amp;D adventure doesn't work if the characters don't have a strong motivation to go into the dungeon. (OD&amp;D provides that mechanically: You want treasure. Treasure is in the dungeon. Get to it.) If you don't have that motivation, then there's no rational reason to go into a death-laden dungeon.<br/><br/>Frankly, I find dissociating character goals from player goals in a traditional RPG extremely ineffective. I also think trying to take the stick of Sanity loss and turning it into a carrot ("you want to go insane!") is a mistake. It flattens the narrative structure. Better to leave the stick in place and focus on the real source of the problem: Insufficient carrots.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352466/#Comment_352466" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-25T05:58:10+00:00" title="December 25, 2011  5:58AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JustinA</cite>Frankly, I find dissociating character goals from player goals in a traditional RPG extremely ineffective.</blockquote>\nI agree.<br/><br/>The best character-creation advice I ever learned was to first think, "What do I, <i>the player</i>, want to do in this game?", and then figure out what kind of character would let me do those things.

I have been told Essentials fixes some of these problems, but the boardgames give me the tactical game without any of the baggage, so I try to play those when I have the chance. Speed of fights is definitely a major factor.<br/><br/>I'm not particularly taken by arguments that there's no role-playing, though. If you tell me it doesn't <i>encourage</i> or <i>support</i> role-playing <i>for you</i>, then cool beans I can understand that. There's games I would rather play myself. But I've heard of dudes who didn't bother ever role-playing until they started playing skill challenges, and it seems obvious to me how anything that livens up fights in Danger Patrol can be used in 4E fights. If 4E is a "skirmish game with D&amp;D branding," then so is Original D&amp;D, which has provided people with just as many opportunities for role-playing and epic story-creating as any version of non-4E D&amp;D. If WotC puts out character creation and advancement rules for the boardgames, I would happily spend a lot of time and sessions with them, role-playing in and out of tactic combat.<br/><br/>That said, when it comes to actual D&amp;D, I prefer to play some version of Basic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352659/#Comment_352659" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-28T18:49:03+00:00" title="December 28, 2011  6:49PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 28, 2011 6:49PM by zircher.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>If WotC puts out character creation and advancement rules for the boardgames, I would happily spend a lot of time and sessions with them, role-playing in and out of tactic combat.</blockquote>\nThat's how I played FASA's BattleTech/MechWarrior for many years.
