For example, you might be surprised by a young boy, running away from a young girl. Why was he running away? Because he was embarrassed by comments made by school kids and adults about the two of them holding hands. What will you do to help out the boy and girl?<br/><br/>* Henge is a term referring to an animal that can turn into a human.<br/><br/>So, take a look at the map. Who lives there?

One of the themes that the author tries to beat into people over and over again (but were so used to *deep* drama, that it's hard to pull back to simply day-to-day simple drama, simple issues) is that it's GOT to be simple, heartwarming, and not involve:<br/><br/>Going Crazy<br/>Death<br/>Psychological Depth or Breakdown<br/>Abuse<br/>Death Again<br/>Teh Emo<br/><br/>Ewen's are perfect: The old man is "grouchy", not abusive or the like. The time-traveller, while *different*, is still simple.<br/><br/>The author notes that in his games, or aquaintences' games, everyone finds it really hard to shift gears to this; everyone wants to go for the hard-hitting emo drama (Reasons, etc) to get that heartwarming. But the heartwarming is like Tai Chi; it comes from the abject simplicity of the emotions underneath (well, they can be strong and such, but they're apart from things like death, abuse and psychological reasons).<br/><br/>This is soooper important for Yuuyake. Including psychological torment, death (that is, being sad because loved one is dead, etc), abuse and the like is out of bounds for the game. It's like saying No Without Rolling Dice in Dogs, or having the players keep secrets from each other in TSOY, etc.<br/><br/><b>Play On!</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218879/#Comment_218879" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T19:55:07+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  7:55PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>I would say it's meant to be some kind of compass rose maybe?</blockquote>\nAh, I was thinking it might be a building on the hill, or a mine or something (the town kinda reminds me of the historic and small mining town of Ashio)... but the arrow at the right side gives it away, the universal sign for "this way is North".

Yuuyake Koyake assumes that everyone is basically good deep down, and that while people might lose their way sometimes, it's <i>always</i> possible to make everyone happy again. I'm having a hard time thinking of good examples, but it's grounded in a certain Japanese style of storytelling. It's kind of like Yotsuba&amp;!, in that it's idealized but not sanitized. You don't lay into someone because they're wrong, but show them how to bring out their better (true) nature. So, following Mark's scheme, the Action shouldn't be too over the top, and the Reason should specifically be something positive, or something that can come around to something positive. Basically, the appeal of playing Yuuyake Koyake is that you go into a safe place for a couple hours, and taking a break from your normal life and normal gaming.<br/><br/>(Though there is a Yuuyake Koyake short story about a widow who recently lost her husband, but the emphasis is very much on a bird henge names Sarah helping her heal and move on with her life. Themes of death aren't totally off limits, but they have to be handled <i>very</i> delicately to fit into the game's tone.)<br/><br/><b>Action:</b> A boy known for causing mischief around town starts teasing the daughter of a rich family that just moved into town.<br/><b>Reason:</b> He's actually in love with her, but doesn't know how to express it at all.<br/><br/><b>Action:</b> A miko (shinto shrine maiden) starts refusing to leave the shrine's grounds, and won't say why.<br/><b>Reason:</b> When she was very young, she promised the local god of the forest that they would marry. Now that she's nearly come of age, she's terrified that she'll have to marry a giant spider. In reality the forest god is just lonely, and he'd be perfectly willing to call off the marriage if only he could have some company.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218915/#Comment_218915" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T05:52:45+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  5:52AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does my first example work within the context?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan" title="SeleneTan"><img alt="SeleneTan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/264/nRW74G3J2K4XC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan">SeleneTan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219241/#Comment_219241" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-18T00:43:51+00:00" title="July 18, 2009 12:43AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Action:</b> A boy sits to the side of the park, watching the other boys playing a game<br/><b>Reason:</b> The boy is small for his age, so the other boys don't let him play with them and pick him last for teams in school<br/><br/><b>Action:</b> Every night a boy sneaks out past bedtime with a lantern and a net to catch moths by the pond<br/><b>Reason:</b> His favorite aunt who was like a mother to him recently moved to a far-away city.
