I can accept, of course, that a comparison between the current poll and the previous one may show that missing off pro-storygame options from the poll may have biased the results in an anti-storygame way... but that wasn't intentional. Basically my main task in setting up the new poll was to take the most popular options from the first poll and refine and add to them to try to get a more precise picture of what's going on.

Not sure if most people will have understood the most popular option the way I meant it. It was meant to cover similar ground to dissociated mechanics, but without the jargon. <br/><br/>Maybe I should have phrased it as:- "rules/gameplay making me think in ways unlike any thoughts my character could be having" -- or at least included that as an option. Or "rules/gameplay not letting me use my character's thought processes but making me use my own". What do you think is the best way of putting it?<br/><br/>Had an interesting thought:- <i><b>immersion in character is about suspending your disbelief of being your character</b></i>. What stops someone from suspending that disbelief will vary from person to person, but it really all boils down to an interruption of that specific aspect of suspension of disbelief. Something that stops you from thinking of yourself as your character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402351/#Comment_402351" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T11:01:04+00:00" title="January  1, 2013 11:01AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, here's a thing, <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> - you said this on TBP:-\n<blockquote>Practically speaking, I play a lot of "just make stuff up" games, and I don't even try to immerse in character in those.</blockquote>\nMaybe this is more a topic for the story-games site than for TBP.

Some players in some games decide through visceral embodiment of the character and feeling their passions, while other players in other games decide through attention to what excites and interests their group.  Omnifray's key word (in the bit you quoted) is "purely", and his point that rules can nudge players toward a certain style of decision is clearly valid.

Like, when my scene has run its course and it's time to draw cards to see how it all falls out, then everyone at the table is free to contribute possibilities there.  Ideas are heard, discarded, altered, incorporated, and accepted until we have truly awesome Success and Failure states to resolve between.<br/><br/>Folks who are used to playing that game in a different way might find that to be an abomination!

Or "experiencing the fiction" versus "creating the fiction"?<br/><br/>GNS claimed to identify "creative agendas", and I've seen it said in a forum debate that immersion is not a <i>creative</i> agenda but an <i>experiential</i> agenda. It seems to me that when people "get their hippy on", if you'll collectively pardon the expression, they're interested in shared/collaborative <i>creativity</i>. When people are gaming immersively, they're not being consciously creative in the same way. They're interested in the <i>experience</i> of the fiction.<br/><br/>EverythingIsTwo discusses this collective creativity <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=14551&amp;start=30#p156113" rel="nofollow">here</a>, with a particular egalitarian slant.<br/><br/>For me, the key difference between storygames and conventional RPGs is the emphasis in storygames, for players, on active creativity, whereas in conventional RPGs there is oftentimes <i>no</i> emphasis on active creativity on the part of players, which may be good or bad for those players' immersive experience of the fiction, depending on how their individual psychologies work. My belief is that for most gamers on the whole it's good (from the limited point of view of the experiential agenda), but there's at least a significant minority for whom it's bad (for that same experiential agenda).<br/><br/>I am well aware, of course, that Stanislavsky theorists would regard the actor (who is ideally in a state of dual consciousness-immersion) as being creative. Bella Merlin refers to (what is basically) immersion as a "creative" state, IIRC. But I think it's very different to the conscious, active creativity involved in storygames. I think it's a passive, reflexive, subconscious creativity.<br/><br/>When I want my active creative kicks, my own general preference frankly is to get them from GMing. I'm perfectly happy to play storygames as opposed to conventional RPGs - <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=14190" rel="nofollow">write-ups here</a> of games I played and fairly much enjoyed at Indiecon 2012, some of which were storygamey - but I guess I find them a bit of an ambiguous middle ground in between playing and GMing, i.e. not my personal ideal.<br/><br/>Personally I think this is part of why one particular hardcore fan of storygaming described Montsegur 1244 as a game of "four mini-GMs", which is of course what I've done with my <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/matt-west/chiefs/ebook/product-20514380.html" rel="nofollow">free-to-download storygame CHIEFS</a> too.<br/><br/>To me this is the nub of why the distinction between storygames and conventional RPGs is interesting, even if inevitably there's a whole spectrum from focus on "my character" to focus on "our story", and games don't often occupy the extreme "our story" end, and many games are somewhere in the middle. It's not a question of what's your creative agenda, but of whether you have a creative agenda at all - of experiential agenda versus creative agenda. The fact that someone can be genuinely and uninhibitedly enthusiastic about both as goals of play, but recognise that (for that individual personally - not as a universal truth for everyone) they are best achieved in different games, seems to me to be a very positive thing.<br/><br/>I would like to see a world where the hardcore storygame crowd can recognise the value some gamers see in conventional RPGs for experiential play, and hardcore experiential gamers can recognise the value some see in hardcore storygames for collaborative creativity, without the misconceptions getting in the way that have muddled a lot of RPG-related discourse over the years, and still do. Misconceptions shown by people, for example, using "trad" as an insult (this I have seen, only 2 months ago), or some of the "funny" things that get written all the time on my favourite trad-centric RPG site. I'm not pretending to be entirely saintly/neutral when it comes to tribalism myself, but I do at least try to behave myself...<br/> <br/>That's sort of my manifesto for 2013!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402407/#Comment_402407" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T16:51:54+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  4:51PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 1, 2013 4:52PM by JDCorley.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>JD, it's only "what they <i>would</i> do" retroactively.

An actor does not necessarily write their character's lines, but might improvise in some minor respect, even in a commercial production. However what Stanislavsky does very expressly encourage is that the actor lives in the moment of acting, responding live to facial cues and the body language of the other actors and to how he, the actor, feels, as his character, in his own body. The actor <i>is</i> in fact giving content to the play. Maybe it wasn't a fair understanding on my part but reading one particular Bella Merlin book left me, momentarily at least, with the impression that the playwright's contribution to a play paled in comparison with the actors' contribution. For me, when I've got my immersion on, [oftentimes] I'm not consciously writing lines for myself... the words just come to me unbidden. It's as if I haven't made them up at all. They've simply <i>happened</i>. From what you go on to say in your second paragraph, I suspect you may have had that experience too, and we're just analysing it differently. Plus, some actors do improv acting, which is freeform roleplay by another name... The difference between active creativity and passive imagination occupies much of the same ground as the distinction between conscious and subconscious thought.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>, surely you can see how for some players, they might think "well, my character would probably do XYZ, but I can see that Jimmy is getting bored, and Jane is starting to pick her nose again... if I do ABC instead, we'll have a fight on our hands and people's attention will be back on the game". Or, "my character would probably do blah blah blah, but if instead I do such-and-such, which, by the way, is also plausible, it'll expose the love triangle between Jimmy's PC and those two NPCs, and we'll get to see it play out before the second NPC gets deported..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402417/#Comment_402417" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T18:55:11+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  6:55PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 1, 2013 7:00PM by JDCorley.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The former, as I say, makes sense, but it's not a conflict between "my character's actions" and  "a good story".

Billy wants to persuade Sandra to turn fugitive and hide out with him in the wilds of Scotland. You don't know this in-character. Your character, Johnny, has a sports car, which Billy asks you to borrow, promising to pay you back. Johnny owes Billy a favour, but the sports car is brand new and it's a big ask from someone who's not very credit-worthy. You could say yes or no; your instincts, as Johnny, are to say no. But you, as JDCorley, might decide to come good on the favour Johnny owes Billy and lend him the sports car, as if Billy can drive fast enough he can make it to Sandra before the immigration officials deport her. Bob will be there too. Billy doesn't know about Bob being with Sandra. You, JDCorley, consider it would be a massive anticlimax to the story for Sandra and Bob to be deported together before Billy makes a stand to try to persuade Sandra to turn fugitive. So - it's not an internal choice for the character. Or, even if the character knew everything you know, the character might not care whether the love triangle plays out or not - all he cares about is his sense of honour in honouring a bet, and his pride in his new car and fear of it not being returned to him. That's his personal dilemma - honour versus love of possessions - and either choice is plausible, but you choose honour for reasons that would be alien to Johnny's psychology.<br/><br/>It's not that one choice is "more plausible", it's that each meets the baseline minimum that it could be considered believable, but one "feels" to you like your character's natural choice. Supposing you're experiencing dual consciousness-immersion, you may have a sense of what feels "natural" to you as your character, but also be aware in an out-of-character way of the desirability that the story reach a climax and not an anti-climax.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402422/#Comment_402422" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T19:22:45+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  7:22PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 1, 2013 7:54PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, I think you've made your point that <i>not</i> having characters make choices is a silly way to attempt a good story.<br/><br/>That's never been the issue here.

Because, if I accept your point in this regard, it seems to entail that actors' creativity is not "passive, reflexive, subconscious". They are, in point of fact, contributing to the story told, and their contribution varies in proportion to the degree of freedom they have over the script.<br/><br/>Second, okay, I can agree that actors do a little of what traditional rpg players do a lot of. I can accept that it's a matter of degree, that it's a spectrum. But that doesn't mean there's not a salient difference. A difference of degree is a difference, and it can be large if the traditional rpg player does to a large degree what an actor does to a lesser degree.<br/><br/>Third, taking the above qualifications into account, it seems to me that you have left my underlying point about traditional rpg players unaddressed. Even in traditional games, the players are contributing actively to the story. They're not reading a script; even in what's called "actor stance", they're composing their parts pretty freely. There are limits to what the player can narrate, but those limits are not decided by a script, but by a prior agreement regarding what parts of the story are for this player to compose and what parts are for others to compose. There's absolutely nothing passive, reflexive, or subconscious about the kind of creativity involved in that. The trad player isn't just "experiencing" the fiction, but co-writing it.<br/><br/>So, what you're saying just leaves me cold and strikes me as an implausible way to analyze immersion. Just me personally, I mean!

Their creativity may be operating entirely <i>subconsciously</i>. When I have my immersion on, oftentimes I am not thinking at all about the dramatic merits of what I say in character; <b><i>I'm not even analysing whether what I'm saying in character is believable</i></b>. What I do is step into the shoes of my character and let them speak through me. I'm not saying that I always have my immersion on to that extent, but when I do, that's often what's happening. Clearly, at some level my brain is creating what's said. But I'm largely unaware of that process myself. I am perhaps hardly thinking at all on any level other than that of my character's perspective on the world; such other thoughts as I may have will have scarcely any impact on the words I utter in character.<br/><br/>Edited to add:- in other words, I shut off my out-of-character thoughts. I shut off me. I transform myself psychologically into my character. There is only him. Or, if I'm there, watching, that's really a sideshow. The main event is me being my character. When I say my character's "lines", I am not composing them from the outside. I am thinking more or less EXACTLY AS he would think, and that leads, naturally, to him saying things. Through me.\n<blockquote>They're not reading a script; even in what's called "actor stance", they're composing their parts pretty freely. There are limits to what the player can narrate, but those limits are not decided by a script, but by a prior agreement regarding what parts of the story are for this player to compose... </blockquote>\nWhen I've got my immersion on, oftentimes there's <b><i>only one true answer</i></b> to what my character is going to say next and how they're going to say it. I don't mean that there's only one believable answer from an outsider's point of view. I mean that I am thinking my character's thoughts for him... I'm not thinking <i>about</i> his thoughts, or <i>about what his thoughts might be</i>... his thoughts are simply <i>happening</i> in my brain the way they would happen in his. Those thoughts lead to one utterance, the same way that my own thoughts lead to a single utterance in real life, and not to a menu of plausible utterances from which some unseen higher power selects. In real life, there is no menu of potential believable utterances, no conscious selection from that menu... there is only whatever utterance my thoughts lead me to express. It is the same for my character, when I am, in a sense, <i>being</i> him. <br/><br/>This may, by the way, be what is meant by the difference between what is called "actor stance" and what is called "character stance", although the two look externally similar. In "actor stance", your character is still fundamentally an external thing to yourself, an element of the fiction that you are thinking <i>about</i>. I don't like the vocabulary of "stances", and to be honest I'm probably not the world's greatest fan of either The Big Model or any columnist who attempts to present a more user-friendly version of the Big Model as if it were somehow a valuable contribution to roleplaying discourse but... you may find <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/columns/rich-stokes/the-roles-we-play-while-roleplaying-part-3-character-stance-actor-stance-and-the-gap-in-between/" rel="nofollow">this</a> useful, if you want to get to grips with the difference between "actor stance" and "character stance". As Stokes puts it, in "character stance", there is no conscious consideration of the character.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402465/#Comment_402465" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-02T07:43:56+00:00" title="January  2, 2013  7:43AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2013 7:59AM by omnifray.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>So...yes, both are believable choices for the character, thus from a story perspective, they're both valid, so therefore there <i>is still no conflict</i> between "what my character would do" (both are believable, plausible things for the character to do) and "what the story needs".

There's no conflict.</blockquote>\nThere's generally speaking no conflict [more strictly, no immediately obvious conflict] between a choice that's believable to an outsider (e.g. any other player at the table, or the GM) and what's good [or rather, seems, outwardly, to be good] for the story.<br/><br/>There is, however, a potential conflict between your "inner truth" of the character and the needs of the story.<br/><br/>If you are deeply immersed in character, if you are thinking "as" your character and not thinking "about" your character, if you are thinking "for" your character and not thinking "of" your character, if you are not consciously considering what you character would do next, but are simply assuming their personality and letting it speak through you, then you will (from time to time at least) have an "inner truth" of what your character will do next. Not of what your character "might believably do", but of what your character "<i>will do</i>".<br/><br/><b><i>Denying that inner truth is counterimmersive</i></b>.<br/><br/>Moreover, a skilled professional - by which I mean an actor, a director or especially someone who trains actors - may be able to tell whether you are acting (cf. roleplaying) according to your "inner truth". Certainly, that is the impression I have from reading about actor training in Russia based on Stanislavsky's teachings.<br/><br/>Likewise, whilst the rest of us may not be able to consciously differentiate between "action according to inner truth" and "action which is believable but not dictated by inner truth", we may be able to subconsciously intuit some flaw in roleplay executed intellectually rather than simply from the heart. We may be able to discern some minor flaw when the gamer is not plugging into his inner truth, though probably we can't put our finger on exactly what the problem is, and usually it's so minor a problem that it's hardly noticeable.<br/><br/>Of course, the biggest problem caused by a discord between roleplay and "inner truth" is the effect it may have on the fluency of the gamer's portrayal of his character and especially on his ability to suspend his disbelief in "being" his character. If you have broken with your "inner truth", you have broken character psychologically. Your character concept is no longer whole, and may need time to heal. Above all, your ability to identify with your character - in the sense of seeing yourself as the character - is shattered. This may lead to hesitant roleplay.<br/><br/>Thus, to me it feels "false" and almost like cheating if, having found the "inner truth" of my character, I then roleplay differently to some other end.<br/><br/>An example of when I did this might be, for example, when my proud, obstinate warrior bowed out of a duel with another PC in a Middle Earth-based game. I knew that the game was more important to the other player than to me, and as I lived a long way away, it was difficult for me to attend regularly. I knew that whoever's PC was killed would probably have no further role in the game (the other player would have taken it the wrong way, and I had precious little enough enthusiasm for that character, far less any of the other alternatives that the GM was prepared to open up to me). So I bowed out of the fight and made up a plausible in-fiction reason. It was within the bounds of believability. But it was totally against my "inner truth". At that point the character could only really become an NPC. He was dead to me. I surrendered my character sheet to the GM without waiting for instruction to do so. I suppose it was likely I would have had to abandon the character anyway, as there was no place for him in the party really after he bowed out of the duel. But if I had carried on playing him, I would have had to rebuild the character concept and my sense of immersion more or less from scratch. It would have been harder in a way than starting with an entirely new character because the character would have had that broken "inner truth" in the background.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402469/#Comment_402469" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-02T08:20:28+00:00" title="January  2, 2013  8:20AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2013 8:20AM by JDCorley.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>There is, however, a potential conflict between your "inner truth" of the character and the needs of the story.</blockquote>\nNo there isn't, not ever.\n<blockquote>An example of when I did this might be, for example, when my proud, obstinate warrior bowed out of a duel with another PC in a Middle Earth-based game.

They're probably the most frequent type of clash outside of CA.<br/><br/>2) IME, the kinds of "true to the character but bad for the story" decisions people tend to make in games that prioritize character embodiment mostly involve backing down from conflict or action.

Somehow the expression "the needs of the story" has been misunderstood as "The needs of the group". Yes, there are players that could find their inmersion broken by an in-game argument that becames an OOC discussion, GMs unable to control such situations quickly enough, etc... but thankfully there are also players with enough sensitivity to foresee such situations and bend the fiction trough IC actions that prevent such inmersion from breaking.<br/><br/>Now, outside of that, JDCorley, you're wrong.<br/><br/>The needs of the story are basically along the line of entertaining (with the optional addition of teaching others and eliciting an emotional response on others), and keeping some sort of coherence. Now, since the duties of the narrator are distributed among the players and the GM (the former collaborate with their lines at least, and the latter has at least to watch out for coherence) there's a need for a shared creative agenda (often loosely imposed by the genre and/or the title of the game) All this and more is needed for the sake of efficiency, since you've got a limited amount of time to tell/make the story.<br/><br/>So basically, whenever the "inner truth" of a character threathens to make the story un-coherent, boring or just too long (which means you're probably not focusing enough in a single story with all that this carries around) there's a conflict with the so called "needs of the story"<br/><br/>Not that there aren't ways to solve this, which are most of the time so simple and logical that they make it look as if there wasn't a conflict there in the first place.

In that case, the "some other end" in question was encouraging my friend to remain in the game, not the "needs of the story". What I was explaining, really, was how the concept of "inner truth" yields only one possible answer to how my character will behave.<br/><br/>To connect up the dots for you, the point is that this "inner truth" is not necessarily nor even particularly likely to be <i>objectively</i> true. In other words, my immersive brain (for instance), when I have my immersion on, is not a perfect simulator for the natural developments in the psychological processes of another human being other than myself who fits the defined characteristics of my player character down to a T. My actions likely will not always accord exactly with what the GM and other players would have predicted as "most likely choice of action in situation X". They could sit round and debate the issue for hours based on all known facts and come up with, say, ten statements about how I'm likely to play my character in particular situations. Unless those statements are VERY abstract, most of them are likely to be proven false. I'm no better a judge, by virtue of being the chosen player, of the natural implications or psychology behind the <i>written</i> character concept of my PC than anyone else. Yet, it's my "inner truth" that has to count for me, as only my "inner truth" can sustain my immersion flawlessly, and whilst another player might roleplay the character better according to some other concept, if it's me roleplaying the character, the best job I'm going to be capable of is by invoking my own "inner truth" for the character.\n<blockquote><br/>What I actually think is illustrative about that story is that it wasn't the mechanics of the game that were counterimmersive, it was the broken-ness of the social situation in the group.</blockquote>\nI'm still on excellent terms with the player in question, but I would have a hard time being in the same room as the GM.

If we're talking about what's necessary for "good story", the shared creative agenda would have to be \n<blockquote>(All this and more is needed for the sake of efficiency, since you've got a limited amount of time to tell/make the story.</blockquote>\nFor storygaming, maybe.

It's about the page-turners, isn't it. This I think ties in with some slightly controversial observations I've made in the past about attention spans and gaming styles... in other words, maybe, in my head, I've confused people's love of page-turners with short attention spans.

In an ultra-conventional RPG, the definitive model of the game-world is what's in the GM's head, as his brain is basically the embodiment of the system. But the model of the game-world that creates your immersion must be the model in your own head.\n<blockquote>And when the rules system focus and only pays attention to the external story and forces you to act to optimize the external story this can happen at the cost of the internal story.</blockquote>\nThis is the strongest way that story and character can conflict.

(Again, we're still stuck on the "less/more plausible" thing.)<br/><br/></blockquote>\nTo flesh out the example, my PC was a berserker who could turn into a bear. The other PC was a noble with 60 warriors under her command. The third PC, a very powerful wizard, had already sided with her to levitate me and hold me effectively motionless in the air when he felt I was threatening the noble. Had I fought the duel, it's possible the wizard might have subtly altered the odds (my character knew nothing about true wizardry). I would also have been going against the nobility, and the GM had tried to encourage us to play according to his version of "Tolkienesque heroism", with deference to nobility. I personally view that as a repellent oversimplification of Tolkien, but it was part of the character concept I had been encouraged to adopt. Plus, the other PC was a woman. My character may have felt it unchivalrous to duel a woman, or even to raise a hand to her in self-defence, and thus could not have a fair fight. And the noble was a good woman and a healer. Plus, my character totally outmatched hers. It may have gone against his sense of honour and ethics to fight this duel for many reasons. From the external point of view, you could totally say that what my character did was more believable than fighting the duel. Remember also, this is Middle Earth we're talking about. And we were only 4 or 5 sessions in at most, so I hadn't had much chance to convey my internal character concept, through roleplay, to the other participants. I was still a closed book to them to some extent. What I chose to do did not hurt the story in a perceptible way. On the contrary, the game went from strength to strength after I had left. And I'm still on brilliant terms (both socially, and specifically gaming-wise) with everyone who was a part of that game, except for the GM.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402517/#Comment_402517" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-02T16:23:58+00:00" title="January  2, 2013  4:23PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2013 4:24PM by creases.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Unless you've confused yourself with a double negative, you mean that you find it counterimmersive when you're in situations like this (from the poll options):- "being expected to decide things my character would have no control over or no way of affecting"</blockquote>\nThat's right, at least on that way of putting it, which is not how I would put it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402522/#Comment_402522" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-02T17:04:24+00:00" title="January  2, 2013  5:04PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I was giving an example of a time when  "having found the "inner truth" of my character, I then roleplay[ed] differently to some other end".

But I think Ron hates that stuff.<br/><br/>I also agree with Deliverator's point that there's no reason why resonant literary stories can't be produced at a page-turner pace.  I've simply run into the non-literary page-turning style more, which makes sense to me as it seems easier and more immediately rewarding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402539/#Comment_402539" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-02T19:11:56+00:00" title="January  2, 2013  7:11PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            G/N/S Narr has *nothing* to do with prioritizing the needs of the story (or of the group, whatever) over how you want your character to act. In a well setup game, all you have to do is play your character, or do whatever the GM role is in that game. The Narr stuff is what emerges from people being true to their visions of their characters.<br/><br/>(The fact that a lot of Forge/post-Forge games de-emphasize Actor stance somewhat, coupled with the fact that the movement as a whole started out prioritizing Narr over the other Agendas, makes this confusion understandable, to be sure! But it really is nothing besides an historical accident. And anyway, we've made good progress in recent years on Sim- and Gam-supporting games.)<br/><br/>That's why issues surrounding immersion etc are more properly identified as technical agenda issues rather than creative ones: they usually have to do with "how," not "why."<br/><br/>Also, it's impossible to be "indifferent to CA."

In that case, the "some other end" in question was encouraging my friend to remain in the game, not the "needs of the story". What I was explaining, really, was how the concept of "inner truth" yields only one possible answer to how my character will behave.</blockquote>\nSure, that's fine, but if there is only one possible answer to how your character will behave, then there's only one possible answer to how the story will go. No other definition of character action or story makes any sense given what stories are.  All I've said all along is that "what's good for the story" and "what my character would do" are, in virtually 100 percent of cases, the same thing. Not that it will be what's good for the group, or that you will always have 1, 2, or 1,000 plausible things for your character to do, by whatever metric, etc.</blockquote>\nI think we're going to be going round in circles but I will try one more time to explain the difference between what is plausible or believable to the group and what is "inner truth" for the player.<br/><br/>There's not very often "only one possible answer to how your character will behave" in a literal, objective sense. There may well be "1, 2 or 1,000 plausible things for your character to do", consistently with everything that any other player at the table, or the GM, has seen of your character and your roleplay so far. Just prior to the exact moment of you making a decision as your character, you could write an essay about his motives, desires, intentions and reasoning process as best you could express it, and psychologists could argue over how he would act in situation X. Think of that as the "visible reality" - visible to the other players and the GM.<br/><br/>Then the moment of truth arrives when you have to make the decision. You make the decision as your character. You are not consciously asking yourself "which 1, 2 or 1,000 things are plausible for my character to do?". You are simply <i>making the decision as your character</i>.<br/><br/>Outwardly, there may be more than one possible answer to how my character would be likely to behave, and more than one possible answer as to how the external story will develop.<br/><br/>Inwardly, I have my "inner truth" of my character - there is only one choice that he will make, and only one answer to how the inner story will develop.<br/><br/>If I force his behaviour into some other outwardly plausible mould, for the sake of the social needs of the group or for the sake of mine or the group's preferences as to what would be an enjoyable story, or even for the sake of making his behaviour seem more believable to the rest of the group, then I've broken with my inner truth.<br/><br/>You seem to be proceeding as if it were axiomatic that there could only be one valid view of what the believable range of choices are that the character could take, and that the valid view of what's best for the story must be consistent with that. What I'm saying is that there are (at least) two valid views of what the believable range of choices are... the outward reality, and the inner truth. And while you are experiencing a particular level of immersion, there is only ever one inner truth, living in the moment as your character. If you are not experiencing that particular level of immersion (though you might be immersed to some degree), this is of no relevance to your direct personal experience of gaming at that particular time.<br/><br/>You also seem to be assuming that there is some "objective" measure of what makes a good story, whereas, I contend, what makes a good story is, for gaming purposes at least, entirely a matter of preference. You may "feel" your inner truth but deny it for the sake of what you consider to be a "preferable" story outcome from the point of view of your private enjoyment. Who is to say that that is not a better story? Perhaps you can force your "inner truth" out of your mind and replace it with some more convenient construct, a replacement truth that fits the story outcome you prefer. No-one else need necessarily ever know about that "forgotten" inner truth. It may have existed in your mind for only a brief moment before you denied it.<br/><br/>This is much like the idea that you can go against your own conscience. You may believe that something is wrong simply because of your own personal reasoning and morals, nothing identifiable with a particular religion or societal viewpoint but simply your personal take on morality. And yet you may go ahead and do it because you enjoy it for some reason. Your "inner truth" is analogous to your conscience in this way. You may prefer to ignore it. You may think that it would make for a boring story, and a boring story is not a good story. You may think it would make for an excessively tense story, and an excessively tense story is not a good story, "excessive" being the key word here. Backing down from conflict, given as an example upthread, may be a common form of this. Your "inner truth" is that your character recoils from the fight, but then you (the player) pause for a moment and think "I'm going to find this story rather boring if I don't get some excitement soon, and then it'll be a rubbish story", so you steel yourself, force your "inner truth" out of your mind and narrate to the group that your character accepts the duelling challenge.

My "inner truth" of my character may at a particular moment be the worst possible vehicle for exposing "theme / premise in the Lit 101 sense". <br/><br/>"Simulationism" in GNS was terribly broken, but let's suppose for a moment you could take it literally and include as an example of simulation the "inner simulation of your character's psychology". That particular variant of "simulation" is capable of leading to immersion and "inner truth", and everything that follows in play emerges from people "being true to their visions of their characters". In fact, the whole notion of "simulation" is simply the notion of "being true" to [in a gaming context, something fictional].<br/><br/>To try to characterise "simulationist" play as simply "being true to the external realities of the game-fiction" is to treat "sim"-oriented players as being utterly uninterested in the internal psychologies of their characters and thus as being unwilling to engage in a serious attempt at realism, which makes it rather puzzling what it might be that such players actually enjoy about the games they play.<br/><br/>What I think of (subjectively) as "good" trad play is very much about being true to your vision of your character. <br/><br/>There may be some people who see that as intrinsically narratively interesting, but your vision of your character may well be a vision of someone who backs away from conflict and prefers basket-weaving and gentle walks in the moonlight. It may be something utterly unlikely to deliver on "theme / premise in the Lit 101 sense".<br/><br/>I get that you may particularly enjoy play that delivers theme / premise in the Lit 101 sense which you then navigate by remaining "true to your vision of your character", quite likely in a state of immersion while doing so.<br/><br/>The point I am making though is that not all inner truth leads to the N in GNS; on the contrary, if you want to prioritise the immediate exploration of the N in GNS, you need devices to promote that agenda within the game. It may well be that for you personally, prioritising the N in GNS leads to greater immersion and exploration of "inner truth", but that is your personal route to inner truth. For many people, play that Edwards would categorise as falling within the "Sim" sphere is what leads most easily to immersion and inner truth... but the GNS definition of "Sim" is very, very muddled, and many forms of "Sim" play may be extremely bad for immersion for some or even most players.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402568/#Comment_402568" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-03T07:11:47+00:00" title="January  3, 2013  7:11AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think we're going to be going round in circles but I will try one more time to explain the difference between what is plausible or believable to the group and what is "inner truth" for the player.</blockquote>\nArrrgh, who the hell cares, that's not what you claimed and not what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>"plausible or believable to the group" is not the same as "what makes a good story" or "what the story needs".\n<blockquote>Then the moment of truth arrives when you have to make the decision.

I simply do my best to sneak in the armour. I probably slow down an extra bit because I notice that the armour makes more noise when I move quickly. But basically, I do my best to sneak, and any effects the armour has, it has naturally, of its own accord.<br/><br/>In moments of deep immersion I am not [or more accurately, generally speaking am not] consciously analysing what my character would do. I am not analysing his drives, beliefs, values, goals and situation from the outside, in the manner of a psychologist/psychiatrist observing a patient. I am already wearing the shining platemail armour. All I have to do is move.<br/><br/>Now it may be, perhaps because I am not used to moving in shining platemail armour, and am not as strong as the knights of yore, that in my movements I look somewhat unlike a knight. Somewhat graceless and lumbering. Somewhat slow and weak. Perhaps if I were to stop and analyse each pace and put conscious effort in, I could artificially make myself seem a bit more knight-like.<br/><br/>But that's not something I could sustain. In fact, by concentrating on doing it consciously, I'd probably make more of a hash of it than by just getting on with it.<br/><br/>So I just get on with it.<br/><br/>The time for conscious analysis of my character's drives, values and beliefs is before or after the game. Or sometimes, moments during the game when I've snapped out of immersion - when I've lost my grip on my character. It's a question of drumming the character concept into my head.<br/><br/>Once it's in there, I just let it do its own thing, without giving it a conscious thought. I'm not saying that that's ALWAYS what's happening, but it often is. <br/><br/>All this, subject to the phenomenon of dual consciousness, which means that I might be immersed AND looking at my character from the outside at the same time... but even so, I think that generally speaking I'm not using that outside perspective to analyse my character's behaviour while I'm immersed (with rare exceptions).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402577/#Comment_402577" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-03T08:28:35+00:00" title="January  3, 2013  8:28AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stories start with an Event (the PCs meet, the dragon attacks, a tragedy strikes) and tend to include other events that doesn't have to be consequent with whatever happened previously. It's part of what we call plot twists. Without plot twists, stories become predictable (which isn't the same as boring). So it's not like stories are (almost) entirely made up of character decisions and the consequences. You'd have to say that satories are (almost) entirely made up of events, character decisions and the consequences.<br/><br/>And there's also character growth and decadence, the forces that change the characters values, drives and goals. And yet we aren't talking about a "good story". So what if, defined by all these things, your character changes and in an early point of the story "what my character would do" is something that prematurely ends the story? If this could be easily avoided by just stating a simple "what my character would do... is to change" would you take that choice or just end the story? Of course, there must be a way to do this without being a jerk and ruin everybody's fun, but I haven't seen nor heard of anybody who has pulled out that trick before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What Breaks/Strains Your Immersion?

My "inner truth" of my character may at a particular moment be the worst possible vehicle for exposing "theme / premise in the Lit 101 sense".</blockquote>\nI'd really have to see an example of this happening, where being true to my vision of my character would undermine our exploration of premise.</blockquote>\nMy "inner truth" is probably always going to be a great vehicle for <i>exploring</i> theme/premise, but not for <i>exposing</i> it.<br/><br/>For instance, we're playing a game of being stranded in the Andes after a plane-crash with the theme of "how far will you go to survive". My inner truth may be that my character sacrifices themself at an early stage to let their loved ones survive. That may be the best way of exploring the premise at that particular moment. But it's not going to keep me in the story long enough to expose the more difficult dilemmas we may face as time goes on and the situation becomes more tragic and more difficult day by day and hour by hour.<br/><br/>We're playing a game of adventure, and I'm playing the archetypal reluctant hero. The "inner truth" of the reluctant hero is a great way to explore how people react under pressure in adventure-situations, but he's never going to kick any adventures off himself.

My inner truth may be that my character sacrifices themself at an early stage to let their loved ones survive. That may be the best way of exploring the premise at that particular moment. But it's not going to keep me in the story long enough to expose the more difficult dilemmas we may face as time goes on and the situation becomes more tragic and more difficult day by day and hour by hour.<br/><br/>We're playing a game of adventure, and I'm playing the archetypal reluctant hero. The "inner truth" of the reluctant hero is a great way to explore how people react under pressure in adventure-situations, but he's never going to kick any adventures off himself. They have to come to him. Great for exploring premise, not so great for exposing it in the first place.</blockquote>\nFor me, both of these examples imply the opposite conclusions as you.  A character sacrificing themselves for their loved ones at the start of the survival story sounds like it is a very strong, good, story choice - and better than having the character not sacrifice themselves just to extend their story.  There might be some other, <b>non-story</b> reasons why the sacrifice is a bad choice - maybe because of player balance or having to switch characters or somesuch.  But the fictional story is stronger for following the character, I think.  <br/><br/>Likewise, I think the story is stronger if a genuinely reluctant character acts reluctant rather than ignoring his inner truth.  Now, again, maybe this clashes with some non-story reason.  For example, maybe it means you have four players and only three characters on the journey.  But that's not really a story reason - that's a practical reason.  <br/><br/>When I think of times that I break from character, it is usually for practical and/or group considerations, not what I would call story reasons.  For example, I am playing a character who I think would kill another PC - but I realize that the player wouldn't like this and it would cause out-of-game stress.  I decline to do it.  However, murder would be a strong and interesting story choice.  <br/><br/><br/>On the other hand, what I think is missing from the discussion is out-of-character choices that <b>don't</b> break character.  For example, I decide based on metagame reasons that another PC was my character's idol.  I didn't make that choice in character, but following it is staying 100% true to my character.  It's just that I have decided what is true to my character.  I'm not sure how that affects things, but I felt like it was missing the prior discussion.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402656/#Comment_402656" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-04T04:12:32+00:00" title="January  4, 2013  4:12AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JHKim">@JHKim</a>, I can certainly accept that at times you make out-of-character decisions about how your character develops between "scenes" which may not involve any distortion of your "inner truth". You are skipping from roleplayed scene to roleplayed scene via your internal narrative. If on the other hand during a roleplayed scene you lose immersion and make an out-of-character decision as to how your character develops, you are not breaking your inner truth because, having lost immersion, there is no inner truth there to be broken. Then add the "dual consciousness" concept to completely muddy the waters...<br/><br/>Regarding the rest of it, it may be only internally that you're "breaking from character" if you choose a seemingly believable course of action that goes against your "inner truth". How does you internally breaking from character directly affect the story for the other participants? It doesn't. There may be an indirect effect there, but they probably won't really notice it. And if you can rationalise your choice and persuade yourself it was believable, then your "internal story" may be essentially untarnished too, even if your immersion takes a knock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17781/what-breaks-strains-your-immersion-poll-on-rpg-net" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17781/what-breaks-strains-your-immersion-poll-on-rpg-net" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17781/what-breaks-strains-your-immersion-poll-on-rpg-net/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17781%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17781%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
