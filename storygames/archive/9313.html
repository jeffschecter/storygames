I'm starting an Agon game with one of my groups here next week, and have run through some battles on my own just to see all the moving parts. I've got a few questions I can't seem to figure out from the text:<br/><br/>* How do you resolve Positioning ties? There's no aggressor. Highest Athletics? <br/><br/>* Fleet Footed: does the +2 for Athletics stack with the +2 for Positioning, given the Positioning roll involves Athletics?<br/><br/>* Do NPCs (human at least) suffer the -1s to missile, melee and positioning for the various armor types? That's a nice advantage for NPCs if they can just buy armor dice with Strife w/o worrying about tracking penalties. OTOH it's nice to not have to worry about that, either.<br/><br/>* Just to clarify: Minions <i>do</i> roll their weapon and shield dice, yes? I ask only because, under the Ganging Up rules, those dice aren't in the equation. The "Minions wield weapons in combat like normal characters" bit strongly implies they do. <br/><br/>That's it for now. The book has been a real pleasure to read through and our little arena-style throwdowns have been fun so far.<br/><br/>p.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206507/#Comment_206507" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-09T20:09:17+00:00" title="May  9, 2009  8:09PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>As I've played it, you don't stack ability bonuses onto bonuses for rolls with special names - "+2 Athletics, +2 Positioning" guarantees you a +2 whenever you roll that die, rather than giving you +4 when you Position (which would be broken).</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206510/#Comment_206510" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-09T20:53:47+00:00" title="May  9, 2009  8:53PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2009 10:15PM by noclue.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>* How do you resolve Positioning ties?

If you don't remember that in the moment, dice for it."\n<blockquote>* Fleet Footed: does the +2 for Athletics stack with the +2 for Positioning, given the Positioning roll involves Athletics?</blockquote>Check out the example on page 54, in which during positioning it points out "...but Aleta has a few advantages. Her heroic trait, Fleet-footed gives her a +2 on rolls involving Athletics, and an additional +2 when positioning outdoors." So, in the example Aleta is getting +4.\n<blockquote>* Do NPCs (human at least) suffer the -1s to missile, melee and positioning for the various armor types?

Basically, it looks like NPC's do use armor and suffer penalties even though there is only a single armor dice space on the NPC sheets and even though John Harper himself "always forgets armor penalties" and finds them annoying...Grrr, I say!\n<blockquote><br/>* Just to clarify: Minions<i>do</i>roll their weapon and shield dice, yes?

One funny thing that made me totally bonkers for several hours is the fact that I'm working from a first printing! Imagine my confusion when I went digging for "hubris" rules (they're on p.36, honest!) and I'm all <i>wuh? </i><br/><br/>NPC armor: I may just ignore that one. Having just run a couple battles on my own, I'm already feeling like actual in-the-heat-of-play battle management is going to be a handful.<br/><br/>Stacking bonuses: Shreyas, my instinct was the same as yours but someone (not John, at least the post I read) said otherwise over @ the Forge. And James is saying the same thing...so I'm not sure! +4 seems waaaay broken but I guess that just means it's an incentive for the GM to ensure there are lots and lots of indoor fights. And/or it's an incentive for the Fleet Footed character to also be super-Cunning, so he can set the battlefield location.<br/><br/>The Positioning ties resolution makes me sad. That's a lot of handling for such a fundamental roll. :-( But I like that Grace and Insight get a little boost. EDIT: It appears this ruling isn't in the FAQ anywhere. I guess I'll doodle it down on my printout.<br/><br/>Thanks all! I know Agon's all crusty and old now but I'm glad braver souls than me have forged ahead to work out the wrinkles.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206572/#Comment_206572" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T13:17:57+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  1:17PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2009 1:18PM by John_Harper.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Paul,<br/><br/>Thanks for giving it go, warts and all. Agon does indeed have some bits that need some polish.<br/><br/>Definitely don't worry about NPC armor penalties. I've experimented with a few different ways to handle armor so you don't need to remember penalties for the PCs, either. The current one is:<br/><br/>Everyone has a d10 Positioning die by default (it's not based on Athletics). Each piece of armor you have lowers your position die by one size. So, one piece = d8, two pieces = d6, and three pieces = d4.<br/><br/>I agree that resolving ties is sometimes pretty fiddly. If you want an all-purpose system, it goes: Aggressor wins &gt; highest Fate wins &gt; dice for it.<br/><br/>Don't worry too much about "broken" character builds. The heroes with +4 bonuses or really powerful combos will be taken care of by the rest of the PCs. If the rest of the PCs are too intimidated to mess with that character... well, there's your leader. It helps a lot if the other players really understand their role in the hero band -- namely to fight to earn the right to be remembered forever. If Aleta is shining a little too brightly and hogging the spotlight, they need to do something about it or accept being second best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206578/#Comment_206578" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T13:50:56+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  1:50PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2009 2:09PM by PaulB.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Groovy, thanks John.

Some thoughts, and a procedural question.<br/><br/>* The note about 3 obstacles = 1 session is dead on. This caught me by surprise! I think Battles run way, way longer than I expected. Fun and all, but yeah...it's gonna be an hour before you come up for air again.<br/><br/>* I think maybe one of my players isn't feeling the Glory chase.<br/><br/>* I think maybe one of my players has figured out how to optimize the Glory chase: Blow all your Divine Fortune at every opportunity to get the high roll, call as many Interludes as you want -- all that extra Strife is just incentive for the Antagonist to throw down with 2d12 challenges. So it's actually in the players' interest to give the Antagonist more Strife, since DF is usually enough to succeed at any challenge (and it seems to come down to luck when competing amongst yourselves for highest roll).<br/><br/>* The combination of one Glory-hound and one Glory-meh player did not produce fireworks. I think despondency in the Glory chase kills the fun. Looking for comeback ideas on this one, since it appears to be a "rich get richer" type of situation.<br/><br/>* The players don't yet have a firm grasp of how awesome Oaths are, but I think that comes down to the spread between theorizing about Oaths (you're only going to give me your shittiest die!) and actually using them (we gotta run -- take this juicy d10 as help!). <br/><br/>* The Big Bad they had to fight might have been too big and too bad for the players to really get into the positioning game on Oaths, i.e. they had to coordinate just to not die. That said, we're using the "winner gets 2 position shifts" rule -- I think the players need to cash in Oaths to make the WINNER dance like a monkey.<br/><br/>* Totally screwed up the +1d6/+1d8 DF effect (just check the FAQ, oops!): I thought the + symbol always meant it added to the final result, rather than just being an additional die result. This I think will greatly reduce the Glory luckfest we were experiencing -- they were blowing all their DF on every challenge, spending DF to chase the highest roll. <br/><br/>* The Positioning tiebreaker rules were a snap to keep in our heads. No biggie. In fact it was nice to give the folks with nice Arete abilities a little bennie once in a while. We're having trouble really putting the Arete abilities to good use.<br/><br/>Questions:<br/><br/>* We're feeling some fuzziness around skills used in Battle. There are two issues:<br/><br/>  1) Do you still designate a weapon in hand for initiative purposes, even when you intend to do a Special Maneuver? This was causing some confusion because I think it's not modeling anything "realistic," i.e. why does the sword guy get to unleash his War Cry before spears get to attack, even when he's waaaay back on the back line? Not a biggie, just making sure that's how it works.<br/><br/>  2) For the "Poison" ability, you impair "an ability the target is using in the Battle." Not sure how to parse this. Is this ability that he's used at some point in the Battle? Or the ability he last used? <br/><br/>  3) If you perform a Special Maneuver, do you get your Name Die for the roll if it's already tied up in your right/left hand mix? This produced a lot of fuzziness, esp. when the Name Die was the only die being rolled for defense...and then there it is getting rolled again in the same exchange for the maneuver.<br/><br/>* I think I read on the Forge forum that Advantage die gets rolled ONCE per quest. True? Seems like it's way, way too risky to set up an Advantage if all you're getting is one die, once.<br/><br/>Procedural rumination:<br/><br/>Okay, so the Antagonist gets Strife at the start of the quest. The suggestion is that about half the available Strife get spent on NPCs. And of course there's the per-NPC strife limit. Cool, no problem. So I statted up two Big Bad NPCs and their minions. Now...do I "spend" that Strife in advance of the quest, functionally reducing my discretionary Strife pool before I even introduce the NPCs? Or do I pay the Strife out of the master pool only when the NPC/minion is introduced? <br/><br/>The reason I ask is that it's entirely possible that an NPC won't get used, so prepaying really hits the Antagonist hard. OTOH if I don't pay 'til I use them, it might make more sense to not even bring an NPC into play if I want to keep more points in my Strife pool.<br/><br/>In last night's session, my Strife pool was 90. Given the preprogrammed costs of the battles I have lined up (NPC + minions + Advantages), that would have left me with 40 discretionary Strife if I'd paid for everything up-front. But what I did instead was simply deduct the Strife as the battle was engaged, so I had a lot of breathing room beforehand.<br/><br/>Given the non-adversarial role of the Antagonist, my gut says you prepay for the NPCs, and it's on the Antagonist to make sure they show up. But I don't entirely trust my gut yet, based on only one play.<br/><br/>Anyway, fun game. Mostly fun; the one player who got shafted <i>a lot</i> with bad rolling feels like the Glory chase is one big random dice game. We'll see what a second round does.<br/><br/>I'm not sure Strife is a meaningful check on the Antagonist's resources, unless you do in fact prepay for your Battle setups. This seemed especially true in light of the "call Interludes early and often" policy: I think they called 10 in 4 hours of play!<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207090/#Comment_207090" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T09:53:38+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  9:53AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2009 9:53AM by Valamir.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have the official rules in front of me, but when Judd ran it at Dreamation he did the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) You don't get to call for an interlude unless EVERYONE calls for an interlude.

But I've got just a tiny handful of things I want to talk about before I run Agon again this evening:<br/><br/>* We're feeling some fuzziness around skills used in Battle. There are three issues:<br/><br/>1) Do you still designate a weapon in hand for initiative purposes, even when you intend to do a Special Maneuver? This was causing some confusion because I think it's not modeling anything "realistic," i.e. why does the sword guy get to unleash his War Cry before spears get to attack, even when he's waaaay back on the back line? Not a biggie, just making sure that's how it works.<br/><br/>2) For the "Poison" ability, you impair "an ability the target is using in the Battle." Not sure how to parse this. Is this ability that he's used at some point in the Battle? Or the ability he last used? <br/><br/>3) If you perform a Special Maneuver, do you get your Name Die for the roll if it's already tied up in your right/left hand mix? This produced a lot of fuzziness, esp. when the Name Die was the only die being rolled for defense...and then there it is getting rolled again in the same exchange for the maneuver.<br/><br/>* I think I read on the Forge forum that each Advantage die can be rolled ONCE per quest. True? Seems like it's way, way too risky to set up an Advantage if all you're getting is one die, once.<br/><br/>That is all.

I think they're better than the special maneuvers in the book.<br/><br/>2) You can pick any ability used at any point during the battle.<br/><br/>3) Yes, you get your Name die for the maneuver even if it's in one of your battle hands. Special maneuvers are not strictly battle rolls, and aren't restricted by left/right hand dice assignments.<br/><br/>4) Advantage dice. Oy. The thing I have tweaked more than anything else. Check out the alternate rules on the wiki:<br/><a href="http://random-average.com/Agon/AlternateAdvantages" rel="nofollow">http://random-average.com/Agon/AlternateAdvantages</a>. Hopefully that will work better for you.<br/><br/>But, by the book, you keep an Advantage die until the end of the quest or until it's cancelled by some action in the fiction.

Of course, I guess if you used these rules:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Everyone has a d10 Positioning die by default (it's not based on Athletics). Each piece of armor you have lowers your position die by one size.

And each die decays separately.<br/><br/>So, you earn 2d10 advantage dice. In a contest, you use one of the d10 in a roll. So now you have 1d8 1d10 advantage dice left. Then, in a battle, you use the d10 on a roll, leaving you with 2d8. Later in the battle, you use both d8s, leaving you with 2d6. Remember that advantage dice represent something specific in the fiction! That's the main restriction on their use.<br/><br/>And yes, the GM sill buys advantage dice the same way. Don't worry about decay. The GM has enough to keep track of.<br/><br/>Brian: Fred's build-your-own rules are great. I recommend them.

Some observations:<br/><br/>* Having a well-balanced mix of weapons in a battle, on both sides, means never really having an opportunity to use Tricks/special maneuvers. Everyone always had something better to do other than a Trick.<br/><br/>* Swift is the coolest NPC trait ever. Combined with a mob of club-wielding cannibals and a mob of blowgun-wielding cannibals, it makes for a very, very slippery battlefield.<br/><br/>* Advantages continue to elude me. Probably worth starting a separate thread to hack through it.<br/><br/>* Oaths, once again, only show up as awesome once someone actually uses them. For-real question: When you cash in an Oath to make someone heal you during an Interlude, does that in fact eat up their Interlude action? Because that's an awesome double-whammy we hadn't realized 'til it happened: stealing the other guy's Interlude is almost better than getting the healing. Even if that's not RAW I think we'll do it anyway.<br/><br/>* Battles are just mechanically engaging enough that there's very, very little room for roleplaying left in our head-space. Lots of real-time math going on (me: as they picked apart my minion groups I had to refigure the die pool and bonus; them: as I used Swift to move into and out of characters' attack zones, players had to refigure penalties). I hope, and suspect, this eases up as we get more fluent with the system.<br/><br/>* The problem-solving is cool but it's such a departure from my past couple years of bangs and hard choices. Tactically it's plenty fun, RPing-wise I don't know that the system facilitates much in the way of character identity.

Everyone loves it.<br/><br/>You did the Oath interlude heal thing right. The double whammy is intentional.<br/><br/>Here are a few tips for putting the RP and Tricks into Battles:<br/>- Play out the breaks as actual breaks in the action. The two sides can shout challenges to each other, makes boasts as they strip off their armor, pledge glory to Ares, etc.<br/><br/>- Have specific NPCs do things to spice up the action. Maybe one of them is holding a hostage and is gonna slit his throat. Or a group of minions are dumping oil down the stairs to set on fire. Heroes will suddenly start looking for Tricky moves at that point. "How can I stop them? They're way back there!" Remind them that the range strip is abstract, and Tricks don't have a range.<br/><br/>- If you have some friendly NPCs nearby, you can kickstart the RP in battle by having them react to the heroes' deeds. "Look at Petracles! What a mighty warrior! We are truly blessed to witness such prowess in battle!" I sometimes do the same thing with a god or two who show up to watch the bloodletting. Nothing gets the in-character trash talking quite like one hero being praised above the others.<br/><br/>- When someone spends divine favor, get the gods involved. The player should actually roleplay beseeching the god and you can have the god appear and interact with the hero in some way. Maybe Zeus steps in and tries to stop Athena from helping the hero, and the gods clash. "Daughter! Do not waste your affections on this weakling!"<br/><br/>You can totally do bangs and hard choices in Agon. The easiest method is to have the gods give incompatible quests to the heroes. Which ones do you obey? What happens if you displease a god? There are other more subtle ways to twist things, too, of course. I once had a priest show up and claim that the heroes had been deceived by Poseidon and only by abandoning their quests and pledging their devotion to Athena would they ever be able to find their way home.<br/><br/>Remember, the gods are fickle, petty, and self-serving. They can (and should) lie to the heroes and ask them to do the wrong thing. That village that just sheltered the heroes from the storm and gave them rest and food? Yeah, Hera found out Zeus has been sleeping with the goatherds daughter so she wants you to put them all to the sword and burn the place down.

Of course, they probably have a god they can talk to every now and then, which can create some interesting opportunities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208142/#Comment_208142" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T11:41:31+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 11:41AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John: That's interesting. <br/><br/>You don't really discuss in the Agon text much about the narrative possibilities of using the gods directly in play, other than when they provide the quest. Upthread you also mention using the gods to provoke intercharacter friction. It sounds like, when you play, the gods are pretty much NPCs. True?<br/><br/>In a practical/procedural/mechanical way, is there anything specific about a semidivine character making contact with mom/dad? Is it just the sacrifice roll?

The back cover copy talks about the premise of the game being a kind of war among the gods, played out among the mortals. I tend to do that when I GM. The gods are backstabbing each other in their cold-war, using the heroes as pawns. Dan Simmons' novel, <i>Ilium</i>, is a great example of this (and the main inspiration for the game).<br/><br/>So, yes. When I GM, the gods are <i>very</i> active NPCs. The heroes are (possibly) the most important people on Earth, so the gods are all up in their business. Almost every time divine favor is used the gods act directly, sometimes even in plain view of the heroes. If the favor helps, the god might be protective and loving. If it doesn't help, there's a fun opportunity to play the god as reluctant or disappointed in the hero for some reason.<br/><br/>Having two gods observing the heroes and talking about them is another fun tool to get everyone riled up.<br/><br/>The way a hero contacts a god depends on the course of action they take and the contests you set in their path. It might just be a matter of sacrifice, sure. Or it could require getting the god's attention in some other way. Cutting down six men in a battle might be enough to get Ares to notice you, for example. I'd leave it up to the player. "You want to talk to dear old dad? Okay. What do you do first?"<br/><br/>Half-divine heroes who don't worship their parent are <i>great</i>. The gods are petty and jealous. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208165/#Comment_208165" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T12:40:38+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 12:40PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup -- looooved the Simmons books, so I've been thinking about that. And Xena too, of course. I'm working out in my head the best ways to use the gods so they don't just, you know, <i>deprotagonize</i> our heroes. I'm also not a huge fan of putting on multiple funny voices to express multiple NPCs having scenes that have nothing to do with the characters. <br/><br/>That's really interesting w/r/t Divine Favor. I hadn't really thought much about DF use looking like anything in particular; more like a mechanical expression of their hero-ness. Which, I suppose, is actually what the name die is for. <br/><br/>Okay, so on the bit about contacting the gods: it's a set-the-goal-and-determine-the-task thing. Got it. Once you get a hold of a god...then what? I mean, other than DF and the initial quest, I'm not super-sure what to do with them. I'll think on it. Again, that deprotagonization thing.<br/><br/>Great protips, John.

Yes. Do that. Or try to. You actually can't get away with it in Agon.<br/><br/>Also, have the gods give aid and advice. Be kind and gentle.<br/><br/>Be fickle. Love them unconditionally then turn on them and hate them. Ares from <i>Xena</i> is just about perfect.<br/><br/>Just give the game a light sprinkling of the gods as flavor, when needed. It's all about the heroes. They're the real powers in the world. You essentially can't say no to them, ever, just give them really tough contests. So they're protagonized. The gods are second-class citizens in this world. They're spectators to the heroes, who do <i>everything important</i>. The gods can praise or mock or lament or throw everyone into Tartarus (or try to... it's a contest!), but they can't really do stuff.<br/><br/>I figure I've played the gods about right when someone at the table says, "Hey... the gods really need us!" and then starts trying to leverage their hero's value.<br/><br/>Oh, and I don't like doing scenes where I talk to myself either. Very dull for everyone. Just keep it really short, like when someone uses divine favor (for example):<br/><br/>"Unseen to mortal eyes, Athena stretches out her hand and brushes the arrow so its flight is true. Behind and above her, Zeus: 'That one is not deserving of your attentions, daughter. Let him die. Find one worthy of your glory.' Athena: 'This one has not yet failed me father. When he does....' "<br/><br/>You can turn the dial on how much of this stuff the heroes get to see directly.

Now that everyone's good and fluent with the game, we've decided that competition + RPG is not good chemistry for us (nothing wrong with the game, it just isn't licking the right spot of our brains). That may not be true for Team Beta (the Thursday crew); I'll find out next week!<br/><br/>Best part of the evening, IMO, was playing through a duel-of-wits-like non-combat Battle: the leader of the Hundred Swords trying to talk the heroes into signing up. It was a pretty uneven fight, one NPC vs. four heroes, but it produced good results.<br/><br/>Although I don't think Alpha will be playing Agon again, some things came up rules-wise that I'd like to put out there, just so it's out there. Dunno if you've gotten this feedback or not, John, but I know you like to hear about this stuff.<br/><br/>* Not really sure how to procedurally handle creating Advantages in the middle of combat. If the Antagonist cranks up the difficulty via Strife, does the Strife go into the final Glory pool that gets divvied up? Does it go nowhere? My sense is that Glory can only be earned when more than one player is competing for highest roller, or had an opportunity to compete. But when it's your go in a battle and you decide to try for an Advantage, nobody else can go for it. So that's fuzzy.<br/><br/>* Do you get Positioning bonuses in non-combat Battle scenes?<br/><br/>* Can you spend an Oath in a non-combat Battle to affect positioning somehow? If so, how?<br/><br/>(This last one hits on a more fundamental issue with the game: It's not in your interest to be the first one to hit the bad guy. Given how damage works, you need to hold off as long as possible so you can get incrementally better hits and therefore the most Glory. Therefore opting to go later in the positioning stack means getting dibs on a higher damage level.)<br/><br/>That's all that comes to mind. I'm sure I'll remember that last thing we couldn't figure out.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208440/#Comment_208440" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-21T00:00:07+00:00" title="May 21, 2009 12:00AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>(This last one hits on a more fundamental issue with the game: It's not in your interest to be the first one to hit the bad guy.
