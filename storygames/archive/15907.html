There are too many variables at play when producing a television show that slavishly adheres to a predetermined finish line. All those breadcrumbs have to lead somewhere. But what if that destination changes along the way? How can one account for the clues already left behind? Assuming that a superior idea won\u2019t arise later is simply arrogant thinking, and counterintuitive to any collaborative process. A television show is a living, breathing entity that represents a synergy of creative, cultural, and social forces that simply can\u2019t be predicted five weeks out, never mind five years out. It\u2019s not a book that can be rewritten before anyone can read it, or a film that can be reshot/re-edited before it screens in theaters. The cat\u2019s out of the bag, for better or worse. Laying in groundwork for a massive payoff down the line is a terrible risk, one that comes with so little control as to be almost laughable."</blockquote>\nWhich gave me a whole bunch of thoughts to throw at the wall:<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever been 'satisfied' by the finale of a long-running tv show. Sopranos, Lost, BSG, Buffy, Angel, The Prisoner ... can anybody think of a show that was hopefully building to something where, once it got to the end, you said, 'Oh, that was so awesome, totally worth the time investment.'<br/><br/>When building mystery Lost / BSG / Twin Peaks / The Prisoner style you can go one of two ways. Explain most everything - which will probably be anticlimactic (BSG) or explain almost nothing - which will probably be frustrating (but at least keep your fans arguing for the rest of eternity) (The Prisoner / Lost...)<br/><br/>Often, your big finish will feel <i>contrived</i> - "Let's try to explain all this crap!" (Babylon 5)<br/><br/>And yet, I don't regret watching any of those shows I listed. (Not even Lost! I loved Lost! I don't care what you say!) <br/><br/>I <i>do</i> regret watching all 10 seasons of Smallville. What was I thinking? Spoiler alert: turns out in the end he's Superman.<br/><br/>So, I think my point is this: as long as your show (or RPG campaign) has stuff happen, relationships change, evolve, grow from episode to episode; as long as some mysteries get solved even as more get spawned, well, that's awesome, and I really don't care that you don't have some kind of five or ten-year plan for how things are going to turn out. In fact, it's better if you don't, because you'll just be stalling, putting off the climax. Get there. Then see what happens next. <br/><br/>Shows that are 'installments' where stuff happens are so, so much better than shows that are 'episodes' where everything stays the same. Big finish on the way or no.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361429/#Comment_361429" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-22T15:05:33+00:00" title="February 22, 2012  3:05PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>can anybody think of a show that was hopefully building to something where, once it got to the end, you said, 'Oh, that was so awesome, totally worth the time investment.'</blockquote>\nThe Shield.<br/><br/>Fuck, I love that show.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361434/#Comment_361434" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-22T15:34:29+00:00" title="February 22, 2012  3:34PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Often, your big finish will feel<i>contrived</i>- "Let's try to explain all this crap!"

When the ending did come around, Mackey was revealed for what he truly was. Considering that the entire show rested on character being revealed through actions, it stayed true to the narrative format of the show itself, which I think is important to make an ending fit. It's one of the reasons why both BSG and Lost seemed to falter in the end, because they suddenly wrapped up their respective stories in a way that had little connection to the way the story had been told up to that point.<br/><br/>An example for the former is Dawson's Creek (surprisingly enough), which leaped forward a few years in its own chronology to show where the characters would end up. It also stayed true to its melodramatic form and structure, so it didn't come across as an awkwardly fitted capping off point for the story. This little narrative conceit can be easily applied to any long-running game, I think. Leap ahead an appropriate amount of time and walk into the session knowing that it's all about saying goodbye to these characters and sending them off in a way that fits the player's idea of what has transpired since the character was first introduced.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362564/#Comment_362564" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T05:04:57+00:00" title="February 25, 2012  5:04AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>I don't think I've ever been 'satisfied' by the finale of a long-running tv show.</blockquote>\nThe Wire.

Don't get me wrong, it's great, I even wrote a college paper about it, but it was a big pill to swallow at the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marqos" title="marqos"><img alt="marqos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/850/nXOPCJBZCOJ7Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marqos">marqos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362840/#Comment_362840" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T00:22:21+00:00" title="February 27, 2012 12:22AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it a coincidence that the best television series ever written and performed -- Six Feet Under -- also has an awesomely emotional ending along with an interesting, unconventional final episode?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
