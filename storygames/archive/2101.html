                    Hey, maybe some of you have noticed that there's this new topic here called "Game Design Help".<br/><br/>Basically, I don't want S-G to turn into a design journal, a collection of boisterous folks using this forum as their personal design blog. Also, I want people to come here and talk about gaming first and look for game design help second; not to come here looking to recreate The Forge in these forums.<br/><br/>However, I totally don't want to put a lockdown on the folks that DO happen to be working on games and stuff, and need some solid advice. Some really cool stuff has come out of these boards out of collaborative help from the members (RPG ideas, LARP setups, etc) that wouldn't have emerged if I shut down all gaming-related discussions.<br/><br/>So I decided to finally create this topic category. It's for folks that are actively working on stuff, and want/need help, or a push in some direction.  It's for folks who need some solid feedback, and will act on it. Doesn't matter where in the game you are, you can feel free to post questions/help requests here. <br/><br/>Little Ideas will still remain for awesome bursts of interesting ideas that you happen to have, be it about a game design, gaming in general, playstyles, etc.<br/><br/>Finally, this topic category is "Hidden" to outsiders.  Only S-G registered members can see discussions under this this Category and respond to it (like the Little Ideas, Meetups, Links to Gaming Discussion categories).  It's to keep the ideas in kind of a "safe zone" where they're safe from outside, until you're ready to share them.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            Hi All<br/>
<br/>
I am working on designing a community role-playing game called Omnificent Role-playing System (ORS).  The name basically means a roleplaying game unlimited in creative power.  People are invited to join as partners or associates to help design and create the next generation roleplaying game.  Partners will have ownership in the ORS product by completing various tasks to finish the game.  Associates are volunteers who will potentially get mentioned in the credits.    The idea is to create everybody's dream RPG.<br/>
<br/>
ORS will be enhanced by PDA, pocket pcs or laptops.  The software does NOT replace the GM, or the player or tell the story.  The software enhance the gaming experience and adds a level or realism currently not possible in pen and paper games.  <br/>
<br/>
