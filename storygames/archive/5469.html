However, the thing I am repeatedly finding is that, whenever that sort of play is present, it brings along with it a load relatively inflexible setting details -- there are people in the world who are called rogues, they do X, Y, and Z, but not A, B, or C, and they fill this niche in the world's economies and societies, and yadda yadda yadda.<br/><br/>Now, I'm sort of thinking that these two things (high crunch value and hardcoded setting details) are kind of inextricably bound together.  You can only have a big pile of fiddly, interactive bits if they are mirrored in the fictional world with fiddly, interactive bits.  Here's the rogue pile, and the paladin pile, and the good-aligned pile, and the larger-than-humans pile, and so on.<br/><br/>The alternative seems to be the relatively anemic "You used a trait to create a +2 situation modifier."  The traits and the modifiers are all generic because they're always applicable, so really, all you have is a pile of numbers that just produce more numbers.<br/><br/>But perhaps I am wrong.  Is there a way around this apparent dilemma?  Are there example games out there that have solved this, in part or in full?  I seek answers, and I petition the people of Story Games to benefit me with their wisdom!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122525/#Comment_122525" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T18:25:05+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  6:25PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes and no.  I think that TSoY has a pretty good amount of crunch, with Keys and Secrets, to crunchify characters and has enough interlocking parts that you can fiddle and finesse the system.<br/><br/>But in general, crunchy bits are tied to very specific ideas about who the characters are and their role in the game.  This, of course, also leaves out the other end of the spectrum, games like HERO, that are crunchy for the sake of crunch while still being relatively free-weight on the roles of the character.<br/><br/>I'll even speculate that crunch comes from the interaction of multiple 'templates', if you will: for D&amp;D you have class, race, skillset, equipment and environment.<br/><br/>Every additional template layer interacts with the others, causing crunch.  Without the framework to support the idea of these templates (i.e. a game where race has no interaction with the ruleset), you remove a layer of complexity and a layer of crunch.  So the more interlocked your rules are with the game setting, the better - as far as crunch is concerned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122526/#Comment_122526" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T18:31:53+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  6:31PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, that's my gut feeling, too.

While many games take the D&amp;D route of splatting for strategy, if the core resolution system has a robust set of gamist options, you don't need to make build/splat choices.

Actually, chess may be the standard bearer for this phenomenon: in order to make sense of the different, discrete elements, you have to name them <em>something</em>, which inevitably results in a world if only by implication.<br/><br/>Chris, I'm not following the BW example -- mostly because I don't know BW very well.

So nobles are still rich bastards with land, ratcatcher is still a lowly unpopular profession, and if you are born a ratcatcher you aren't becoming a noble anytime soon.  So in that sense all the crunch is still tied to a basic worldview.  Yet if you looked at the various examples of play over on the Burning Wheel I don't think you could pick any two of them and say, "These are clearly from the same setting."  Instead of a thief template, there are easily dozens of lifepaths that strung together could lead to a current profession of thief and each really gives a unique spin on things.  I'm not sure if that is what you are looking for, but I would check it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Astinus" title="Astinus"><img alt="Astinus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Astinus">Astinus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122651/#Comment_122651" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T07:46:18+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  7:46AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Hituro on this one. GURPS is very highly crunchy, almost to the point of absurdity at times. If you really wanted to munchkin or min/max is that system, you could get very out of hand. I noticed this when I was putting together some characters on a GURPS character creating program and realized that without the GM being reasonably careful about what does into his game, you could end up with people piling on totally irrelevant disadvantages to literally make themselves into tanks or raging monsters. That's where the hardcoded setting comes in. If you don't have one or if your characters don't follow it, your party is going to go from a standard fare bruiser/mage/support character/sneaky person to cyborg dinosaur jet fighter/magic artillery platform/walking hospital/naturally invisible assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, if your players are reasonable about things like choosing from a long list of abilities where some are clearly more suited for a combat build or may border on "cheapness" and staying within a setting you define, you should be alright. It sure is crunchy and tactical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122661/#Comment_122661" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T08:14:58+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  8:14AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahhh ... the classic dissembodied brain in a jar with psychic powers you mean?<br/><br/>Of course GURPS has always supplied a lot of separate settings, and married them to the rules system, but with 4th edition they have been doing a lot less setting and a lot more rules only supplements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122676/#Comment_122676" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T08:52:00+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  8:52AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For tabletop, <i>HERO</i> is your huckleberry.

From my very slight exposure to BW (I played a Duel of Wits demo and described it as pleasantly fiddly, which Luke did not appreciate), I seem to remember it had a number of conversational maneuvers that interacted in interesting ways.  The rules sort of stated "this is how conversations and debates work," which is a very diluted version of my OP's "this is what the world is."  I'm not sure if that makes it a counter-example or an edge case. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  I'm also not sure if basic Duel of Wits is appropriate to any setting -- is it used without modification in the Blossoms are Falling setting, or do rank and honor and things impact it differently?<br/><br/>I used to be a big, big GURPS head, but to me GURPS represents a different kind of crunch -- there is very little layering of tactical options in GURPS; every character functions essentially the same, perhaps with some relatively minor differences in probabilities of success.  A flying tackle is a flying tackle, for instance.  Contrast that with a game where your character build does not say what your character is <em>good at</em>, but what your character <em>can do</em>.  (Admittedly, there are some bits of GURPS that work that way, such as Magery, but I've always considered those 'turn-key' advantages to be odd ducks in contrast with the rest of the system.)  Perhaps what I'm getting at is not so much 'crunch' as specifically 'exception-based crunch' that one sees with splats and classes and whatnot.  Hm.

If the crunch hasn't had any effect on the Setting yet at that point, then why must it be hardcoded into it except to suspend disbelief?<br/><br/>-JT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122986/#Comment_122986" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T08:37:09+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  8:37AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, yes, I'm looking for a game that doesn't dictate color, not one that operates without color entirely.

Player thinks of some capability; finds the right Power, Talent, or Skill; modifies it with Advantages and Disadvantages; and then "names" it--pure color, which evokes setting and tone and character concept, but which has NO mechanical impact unless points are spent (or saved, for Disads). This can be indepeendent of or working in conjunction with whatever "pre-existing setting" the GM or players envision. In fact, Hero has one of the earliest, strongest player-empowerment elements in gaming: player creation of Limitations which, in turn, can define NPCs, organizations, and even the scope of day-to-day challenges (based on frequency with which they activate). It goes even further, with things like Base creation, Sidekicks, and various henchmen techniques. Want to define a session's "victim?" Create a Dependent NPC as a Limitation!<br/><br/>In short, setting can be a void until the players fill in "color" as well as actual, mechanically existent world elements; or the setting could be minutely designed with tight restrictions on how the players may build PCs, to evoke a very particular world. Set your dials and GO!<br/><br/>But maybe I am misunderstanding your goal amidst all the jargon and trying to dial-in on your imagined ideal. But "Crunch without Hardcoded Setting," however, is the definition of Hero System.<br/><br/>Good luck;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123144/#Comment_123144" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T16:10:14+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  4:10PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Am I the only one that felt like Burning Wheel was as fiddly as D&amp;D?<br/><br/>GURPS is pure math sex.

Other games would say "I don't really care how much damage your crossbow did to your suit of plate, these are the game rules and they are about balance". GURPS players on the other hand *do* bring that up and the rules get changed!<br/><br/>When it gets really weird is when they apply that to magic and superpowers and other inherently non-logical things and write rules that are just as logical, mechanical and demanding of internal consistency as the rules for tank design.
