Instead of producing a story where things weave together and one another's ideas are integrated; this instead, produces a tree affect where the branches go everywhere and are unconnected and it becomes impossible to tie the disparate ideas together to bring the ideas back together in a coherent and satisfying ending or whole. I also believe that game design plays a role; for example, I have played Fiasco many times and this is never been an issue. I have also played Follow many times and this has never been an issue.<br/><br/>However, when one hasn't played a game very often and one has this branching, it is hard to know whether to attribute it to the game design or to the way the group played the session. Obviously, most of the time it is probably a combination of the two. If I feel lukewarm about a game's subject and the design seems lacking when one of these less satisfying sessions happen, I'm hesitant to give the game another chance.  If I'm extremely  interested in the game  and the design seems interesting I definitely want to get the game another chance, albeit after a bit of time has passed. <br/><br/>Two games that I am very interested in, which others have reported having great sessions of, ended with these results in the first session we played. This obviously could've been an issue that was completely based on how the group played, but it is hard to know what percentage of this was due to the group or the game design. The two games were "Okult" and "Society of Dreamers." I am especially interested in playing "Okult" again.<br/><br/>When I play these games again, I want to play them in a way that is least likely to produce this tree branching affect. Besides sharing the story and building up on each other's ideas, as well as not throwing in huge twist that can overly complicate things and are typically hard to manage on the fly and get good results from, what are the best ways to ensure a good session? I'm most interested in ideas about how to get the best session out of Okult. <a href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">@Wilhelm</a> I'm especially interested in hearing from you about what we can do and about your perspective in general. Also, I would appreciate hearing <a href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">@Ben_Robbins</a>  perspective and others who have played a lot of Story Games.  By Story Games, I mean them in the sense that Ben and I define them. The definition can be found here, if you're interested:<br/><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/</a><br/>I think that this is a very common problem  in the broader sense and would be an interesting and useful topic to most of us on Story Games to discuss on multiple levels. Any help or advice  would be very appreciated :-) thanks :-)                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461976/#Comment_461976" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-15T22:37:12+00:00" title="April 15, 2017 10:37PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an important issue, indeed. However, my current belief is it's only <i>obliquely</i> a design issue.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways, this is the core of the roleplaying activity, and its main difficulty as well. Therefore, a typical answer would be: people need to train together, as a group, to achieve optimal results - even then, they won't succeed 100% (but close). That's more-or-less implied in a lot of Ron Edwards texts, for example.<br/>If you look at <i>Archipelago</i>, by Matthijs Holter, that's a role-playing game where all mechanics are geared not toward achieving the optimum but, rather, toward training players in those basic techniques and best practices which help achieve it. That was even more explicit in Archipelago II than in the current, 3rd edition, due to the inclusion of a small essay about teamwork.<br/>Granted, in games with a GM, MC, whatever, it generally suffices for the text to focus on teaching <i>one</i> player, who will then teach the others.<br/><br/>But I do believe that design has something more to contribute - specifically, the generally tighter the game, the harder for play to go astray or lead nowhere at all. That's why I callled it <i>obliquely</i> a design issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461978/#Comment_461978" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T00:16:21+00:00" title="April 16, 2017 12:16AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Total agreement here.

The reason we were able to pull it together somewhat despite this is that we tried to adjust to one another's ideas. I don't think it is because we didn't share the story or try to build on other's ideas... it was also likely part because we were not in person and could not read each other's reactions to one another's contributions, and because we strayed a bit from the traditional archetype of the quest, which also compounded things. But despite all this, because we worked together, we are ultimately able to thread our ideas together and have a coherent ending.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461988/#Comment_461988" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T05:11:57+00:00" title="April 16, 2017  5:11AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2017 5:39AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The the thing that often happens, which causes the disconnected story-thread branching affect rather than the connected-story thread weaved affect, is that a player gets attached to one of their ideas that they think is clever or a plot twist they think that is clever and goes in their own  direction without considering what other players have already contributed and without thinking of  it's effects on the story...it often happens when someone thinks their contributions are more important than the others or when they are trying to impress others or when they are trying too hard to be cleaver.

Sad to hear that it didn't click with your group. <br/><br/>Fundamentally I think this is a player side issue. Players have to be committed to the same experience, or there will be several different agendas at the table. The game can only do so much to help align them. <br/><br/>Have I played too much? Whenever I play I can almost see the branching story tree before my inner eye. Past choices and possible outcomes of the current ones. And most importantly future intersections where they can join up again. If I play with beginners I can often manage this reuniting of plots by proposing small things to the players, eg a key NPC that appears in multiple functions. <br/><br/>But Okult doesn't leave you entirely on your own when it comes to this. <br/><br/>Already in character generation you are forced to invest in each other's stories. The prompting play flow mechanic where every one is encouraged to contribute in play helps you to highlight points where stories intersect. <br/><br/>When playing OKULT online I have added a step to the setup. We have a short talk about the nature of the threat. It prunes a couple of branches from the tree, but also makes it easier to go in the same direction. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461993/#Comment_461993" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T06:26:56+00:00" title="April 16, 2017  6:26AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>We have a short talk about the nature of the threat.<br/></blockquote>\nOooh!

But the point is, at least four things are behind why some games get "branched stories".<br/><br/>This is a very general answer to something that probably need specific answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462004/#Comment_462004" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T12:34:47+00:00" title="April 16, 2017 12:34PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2017 12:41PM by 2097.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<small>deleted, went a bit OT, keep going folx <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462005/#Comment_462005" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T13:00:29+00:00" title="April 16, 2017  1:00PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some Players tend to not be good listeners or to not care (enough) for the integrity of other's contributions, which in most games results in less than optimal and cohesive storytelling.<br/>It really just takes a dissonant idea to create the "branching out" effect that Jeff talks about.<br/>Or to send the story in a direction that, although compact, is not to everyone's satisfaction.<br/><br/>As Rafu mentions, the only real long term cure is to have such players "train" the skill they are obviously lacking.

Or fixating on their own personal head-movie, no matter what else was happening around them.<br/>(note: I usually play with strangers)<br/><br/>Currently my go-to game for newbs and strangers is <b>The Quiet Year</b> as it is much more difficult to fuck up in this way. Still, it can happen from time to time. Also <b>Montsegur 1244</b> has had a good success rate.<br/>Still, on occasion the problem surfaces again, and the branch generating idea makes its way on the table. The only ready solution I found is to have a short out-game conversation to negotiate a more acceptable contribution.<br/>But this takes expertise and ability from the facilitator, especially with people new to rpgs that you would like to impress with a fun and positively memorable session, but are also wary of bashing down ... course correction takes skill and care :P<br/><br/>One thing I noticed about a lot of story-games is that most share a common philosophy. Which in theory is all nice and good, but in practice often leaves them incapable of addressing the kind of problem Jeff talks about.<br/><br/>The feeling I get is that... usually the message is "<i>let's all be nice to one another</i>".<br/>This works ok for some people, but fails when falling on somewhat deaf ears. Mechanics like the code-words to have a say about each other's descriptions (which I've seen in <i>Archipelago</i>, <i>Hell for Leather</i> and a I believe also <i>Love at the Time of Seyd</i>) do help, but only up to a point.<br/>Somehow the system tries to have Players <b>avoid</b> confrontation, <b>avoid</b> expressing their preference, <b>avoid</b> spilling their beans, in favor of a softer approach where (ideally) everyone listens to and cares for everyone else.<br/>When people don't listen and care, the system fails BUT the game does not break, thus producing a substandard experience.<br/><br/>I personally like more, and find more effective according to my personal experiences, a diametrically opposite approach. Especially when rules complexity increases or when mid-long term play is desirable over one-shots.<br/>It is the approach exemplified by the <b>FateLess</b> rules system.<br/><br/>The idea is to convey, through the overall mechanics of the game, a message more on the lines of "<i><b>be honest, hell be egoist </b></i>".<br/>We all play together, sure, but instead of tip-toeing through every action and description for fear of maybe somehow possibly saying something others don't like... instead of this the mechanics try to ease and facilitate people to "care less" and just go, speak up their mind, and then for their voice to be impossible to ignore as it will have an obvious impact on the game.<br/>Let the game bring people to confront and face one another.<br/>Then see what happens.<br/>The most common outcome I've seen happen is that everyone's ideas and tastes and intentions become clear to one another, and then minimal route corrections on the fly are all it takes to make everyone happy.<br/>Other times an actual social problem will come to light, like when a Player truly does not listens or cares for other's ideas. The mechanics tend to exacerbate that problem until, in very short order, either the Player understands that his behavior is problematic and self corrects, or the game brakes forcing people to take a step back/out from the game and talk openly about what just happened, as humans.<br/>In my experience this is pretty much what the aforementioned "skilled facilitator" ends up doing: find out the problem, bring it to light where it can be clearly seen, stop the game to address it.<br/><br/>I personally favor having a stark interruption that might lead to an actual clarification and a good game continuation, rather than a softer approach were everyone is kind of uncomfortable but not enough to speak up and keeps on shuffling and fidgeting until the session ends with various degrees of internal unexpressed cringe.<br/><br/>I've seen this approach work wonders on the actual gaming tables I have been part of.<br/>But as an explanation, does this make any sense to anyone except me?

I am going to introduce a pregame chat in which we talk about what kind of tone we are going for\u2026we will basically give the players that agree on tone more weight but at the same time compromise  with other players who prefer a different tone.

That's how I remember it, too.<br/><br/>Hasimir,<br/><br/>Your post is interesting, but fairly hard to understand for someone not familiar with FateLess. Can you share *how* and *why* you think the design of the game creates the dynamics you're describing? It's all very abstract just now.<br/><br/>Dave,<br/><br/>Great thoughts about "what is it that excites you about this?". I'd love to explore that some more; perhaps there are cool and smart ways to do this somehow.<br/><br/><br/>On the general topic of the thread:<br/><br/>My favoured approach to this problem in design has been... well, two thoughts. <br/><br/>The first is through mechanics which really force people to drive towards a common destination (my game <i>Musette</i> is pretty consistent in this, for example, because the mechanics force the players to keep adding different events and details which are all headed towards the same decision point; <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> does some of this by encoding so many of the themes of play into the conflict resolution mechanics). <br/><br/>The second way is to build your fiction so that most of the inventions being bandied around demand input from multiple players. I don't know if it's in the rules (because I've never read them), but when we started a (sadly) aborted game of Okult with Wilhelm, he had us do this very nicely, each asking questions and adding information about the fiction and its denizens.<br/><br/>I like to do this in a lot of designs, where the final product occurs as a synthesis of other peoples' ideas. (Dave, if you're reading this, you may now better understand the whole Questions &amp; Elements thing I was going for in our <i>Inconceivable</i> playtest!)<br/><br/>For instance, in <i>Musette</i> you and I start the game by each generating a story element (for example, a character) we want to see in the coming game. But then it's a third player who grabs two of our ideas and says, "Hey, these go well together - let's use them." <br/><br/>I find this helps generate non-obvious outcomes and encourages us all to have an interest in them. If someone had a "darling idea", chances are it's been recontextualized or transformed, so they're not likely to keep pushing it in that original direction. If someone was trying to run off into the deep end, their input has been thrown out or redirected.<br/><br/>It would be really cool to find clever ways of doing this with more freeform fiction/roleplay, as well. I can't think of any, but that doesn't mean they can't exist!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462025/#Comment_462025" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T18:52:44+00:00" title="April 16, 2017  6:52PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2017 9:03PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to work on a sheet that outlines some of these suggestions and give it to the group and let them know that I had a discussion on Story Games that help to  make the issues more explicit.

To head off that problem, I like to write play sets where there are are multiple triangles that keep everyone connected.  There's the central NPC (a Rose by other name) that each character has a relationship with, a central mystery/trouble, each character has a tie-in with another character (one that usually causes dramatic friction), and then everyone has their own secret agenda.  The blend seems to create much more successful games than duds.  When it does create branches, there are usually one two triangles circling each other and there still tends to be interaction between the two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462131/#Comment_462131" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-19T05:58:34+00:00" title="April 19, 2017  5:58AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Hi, happy to hear that you played Okult. Sad to hear that it didn't click with your group.<br/></blockquote>\nWilhelm, thank you for the suggestions :-) Just to clarify, Okult did click with our group. Everyone wanted to the play the game again despite not being able to pull our disparate story threads together in a satisfying way; we just want to do everything we can to create a more coherent ending the next time we play.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
