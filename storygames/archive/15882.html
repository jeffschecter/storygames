I hit a creative block.\n<blockquote><cite>Scattershot [5]</cite>It's a simple mechanic. Roll 2 ten-sided dice and subtract <span style="color: #00FF00;">the sum</span> from your target number. Use dice rolls to introduce uncertainty, but never let them block play. The degree of success or failure is applied as complications rather than pass or fail.<br/><br/>Target numbers are any stat, skill or power on your pre-generated character write-up. The milieu is provided as the gamemaster's write-up.<br/><br/><span style="color: #FF0000;">In no particular order, take turns describing to the others what is happening in play.</span> Anyone can propose the next scene. Base it on play so far or one of the write-ups, but not anything else.<br/><br/>Pacing is a gamemaster's top priority. From this proposal only he sets the scene and then play begins <i>in medias res</i>, with the relevant character's first significant action.<br/><br/>Experience dice are six-sided plot devices that can be rolled to modify any other die roll. <span style="color: #FF0000;">For example, if you believe a roll should be more difficult due to the circumstances, penalize the roll with one of your experience dice.</span> Once rolled, they are returned to the shared pool of dice.<br/><br/>Whenever you need more Experience dice, you can; invoke a trope on anyone's write-up to get 'keepers', roll to an advantage trope with 'gimmes', do something awesome and get 'freebies', see something awesome and give 'freebies' or you can always 'loaners'.<br/><br/>Tropes are color-coded into roughly three groups; red tropes involve overcoming opposition, blue tropes improve escapism and yellow tropes make play like a story.<br/><br/>Between scenes, you can use experience dice to add or subtract development points to any stat, skill, power or trope on your write-up.  You can also spend a development point to 'buy back' one experience die. Roll as many as you want (and add more as you go); a total of 6 gives you 1 development point, 10 gives you 2, 14 for 3 and so on by fours.<br/><br/>It's only natural to have disagreements. If no one can offer an acceptable compromise, auction off the results for the situation. Taking turns, each party bids experience dice. The highest bid solution is followed and the lowest bidder receives all of the dice bid.<br/><br/><b>FAQ</b><br/>What if I want to use a plot device when there isn't a roll to add it to?<br/>Simply roll experience dice and treat that as the degree of complication.<br/>What if I saw something really cool in the game book and want to propose a scene based on that?<br/>Look for some way that it is relevant to play-so-far or any write-up. Otherwise, add it to the background section of your write-up; not everything that you expect from your write-up will necessarily be written down.<br/>Can I keep any 'gimmes' that I don't roll?<br/>Gimmes can only be used in the roll granting them and must be discarded afterwards.<br/>Do I have to pay interest on 'loaners'?<br/>No, but don't forget 'payback'! [This rule is undergoing revision.]<br/>Can I use experience dice to change the past?<br/>Yes. If anyone has problems with a retro-active change, you can always have an auction to solve it.<br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><b>Blank Character Write-Up</b><br/>Character Name\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What's said in-game, stays in game.<br/>Stats (SAHROP)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Positive dice results are called MIb (Made It by) numbers, otherwise they are MIb (Missed It by) numbers.<br/>\u2022 STR - Strength [Rating]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Rating stats use the UE Chart to find the maximum of how much can be done/affected<br/>\u2022 AGL - Agility [Target]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In a MIb Number contest, the reactive dice roll is subtracted, leaving the affecting MIb number.<br/>\u2022 HIT - Hit Points [Resource]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Resource stats may get 'used up'.

But reading your notes is confusing and not very easy to parse. It would help a lot if you could give us some more specific questions. There are lots of neat ideas in the text you've presented (like experience dice allowing you to modify difficulties in play, and what looks like a Creative Agenda "meter" to be used in play), but I have no idea which parts "work" and which parts you're "stuck on".<br/><br/>So it is very hard to offer any sensible feedback. Your last post says:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Fang Langford</cite>Does the complications part help?  I'm stuck trying to say, in a positive manner, not to make rolls like the infamous 'can I jump that chasm' roll.  For example, if the thief fails his 'lock picking' roll, he should not roll it again.  The act of 'getting inside' becomes more complicated instead.<br/></blockquote>\nThis sounds like a concrete question! Although I don't understand <i>what</i> you hope "the complications part" helps. Is there a specific problem you're talking about? <br/><br/>Here is what I can see in your post about complications:<br/><br/>1.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Fang Langford</cite>Use dice rolls to introduce uncertainty, but never let them block play.

The act of 'getting inside' becomes more complicated instead.</blockquote>\nHere is what I can see in your post about complications:\n<ol><li>Use dice rolls to introduce uncertainty, but never let them block play.

If I put this example following the first paragraph:\n<ul>Your burglar needs to liberate certain documents from the sheriff's house to clear his good name.  To make things more interesting, the gamemaster declares the building locked and challenges you to gain entry.  A dice roll 1 higher than your character's lockpicking skill (MIb of -1) does not mean you fail; it provides the complication that you must find another way.</ul>\nWould that make the first paragraph make more sense?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Introduce your game first.What is it about?What do the players do?How does it work?Is there a GM-figure?Does anyone play individual characters?</blockquote>\n<ol><li>You're quite right.

There have been a number of very successful and very affordable game bundles recently (for example: <a href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/107" rel="nofollow">Vincent's bundle</a>), and I suspect they will continue to exist because of how successful they have been. <br/><br/>You could also try your luck with a podcast or a review, or anything else that creates more publicity for a game: I'm sure many designers would send you a free copy of their game if they saw you could generate some press for it.<br/><br/>Just some thoughts! I'm sure there are many other ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
