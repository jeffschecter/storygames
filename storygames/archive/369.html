                    Okay, this idea is a bit unformed at the moment, but I was rereading some of my tiny RPG .pdf's last night while waiting for some screen captures from Digital Devil Saga to finish downloading, and something occured to me.<br/>
<br/>
One of the more appealing things (to me) about the Shin Megami Tensei games is that they combine atypically involving storys with extremely "Japanese" gameplay. What I mean by that is that these games are brutal little bastards that will come up behind you in a dark alley and snap your neck like a toothpick. The two things that really drive this are the skill use costs and the Press Turn System.<br/>
<br/>
The skill use costs are fairly standard, in that to use magic you have to burn up some MP, but what takes the games a little bit further over that edge, increasing your strategic concerns is that physical skills cost HP, reducing your effectiveness in a different way than casting spells do. <br/>
<br/>
The Press Turn System is a real lovely little thing where exploiting your opponents' weakness can get you up to double the actions you normally would, but hitting a strong spot (for example) can cost you your entire turn.<br/>
<br/>
What the heck does this have to do with table-top RPGs?<br/>
<br/>
Well, one of the .pdfs I was reading was Insylum, which, I realized, operated in a fairly similar manner. You have Fatigue that is spent to make physical actions/attacks, and used to resist and suffer damage on. You have Lucidity (which I don't recall if it works quite the same way for mental tasks, but for what I'm going to do, I'll just toss whatever other purpose it serves and set it to that) and Memory, and Memory is where the Narrativism comes in.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that Nar games address is credibility, and it occured to me that by tying a Memory equivalent to the player's ability to input in a metagamey level into the story, one might be able to set up a situation where tactical play was actively pursued (both in and out of combat) without jarring against the "hacking the universe" type capabilities players have access to in games like The Pool or Universalis.<br/>
<br/>
The specifics of how such thing would work, though, I haven't given much thought to, but for the sake of discussion I'll use this model.<br/>
<br/>
Note: I'm not going to bother coming up with alternate names for the Insylum stats just yet.<br/>
<br/>
Fatigue: Capacity for physical exertion, health.<br/>
Lucidity: Capacity for mental exertion.<br/>
Composure: Capacity for social interaction.<br/>
Memory: Burns to build the setting/situation, derived by giving up temporary points from Fatigue, Lucidity, or Composure.<br/>
<br/>
So...what do y'all think, or I am being too unclear?                </div>

                            So,  you can burn Memory to gain narration rights? And, by doing so, you lose some of your pool of points to use in tactical situations?                        </div>

                            Yeah. You build up Memory either by buying it with Fatigue, Lucidity, or Composure, or I'm thinking of including a Fan Mail type mechanic where players can do the "That was cool" feedback thing through awarding either Memory or points that ball up into Memory points. I don't know how much narration rights a point of memory should be worth, but it probably ought to be at least the textual equivalent of a solid paragraph or so, since tactical effectiveness is being reduced.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm...the Collaborative Worldbuilding thread has that Codex thing, where the players get to add lines of description to elements of the game world. I might adopt something like that as one of the options of spending Memory. Either starting a new entry (introducing an element into the game) or building on an old one.<br/>
<br/>
Have that in addition to the more immediate style of use, where you fiddle with the immediate situation. I'm somewhat fond of the idea of offering a short-term investment option and a long-term choice.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I'd kinda have to see it flushed out more to completely understand.  Also, I'm not sure if "narrativist" is the right term: You can still have a narrativist-focued game if you took that above HP/MP/Turn System and slapped it wholesale into a game, and added OTHER mechanics or mechanisms for encouraging narrativism. You don't have to have "mental/social stuff tracked" to make it a narrativist game. You can have a total tactical wargaming experience... PLUS stuff (cause more stuff will be needed)... to make it a real "narrativist game".<br/><br/>Having said that though, I'm not sure WHAT the right word would be for what you came up with (because it's not quite inherently narrativist <i>yet</i> IMO), but I'm thinking "fuller". Your ideas sound much more "full" and "rich" for a tabletop experience than simply using the hp/mp system of MegaTen. Which is cool. <br/><br/>I've read through about three iterations of the Megami Tensei tabletop RPG that's been released in Japan. Each time I go back, I'm this much closer to buying the latest version (in this case, the Nocturne game), but the text too fine, layout too sparse, so I'd get those translation headaches. Most of all, though, it doesn't really bring anything new or interesting to the table: It's the same old thing, stats and monster summoning stats and HP, MP etc pulled right from the game. Which doesn't make sense, as the tabletop is a different experience than sitting alone in front of the console. <br/><br/>Your idea looks to take the meat of the conflict system and spin it so that other realms of activity are included, which is tres cool. I'm looking to see where you go with it.<br/><br/><b>BREAK</b><br/><br/>BTW, did you see the clip for the upcoming Megami Tensei: Persona 3 game?<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-M1Ie0uHI9jA?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1Ie0uHI9jA"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/M1Ie0uHI9jA/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/><b>YOU ARE SCHOOLKIDS THAT SUMMON AND CONTROL DEMONS.<br/>YOU SHOOT YORUSELF IN THE HEAD TO SUMMON DEMONS.<br/>SHADOW TIME THAT EXISTS PARALLEL TO REAL TIME.<br/>THERE IS A WARPED CASTLE OF SHADOW TIME.</b><br/>I don't like console RPGs that much, and the MegaTen series has been extremely frustrating, and yet I will buy this game.

                            Thanks for the reply, Andy.<br/>
<br/>
Narrativist probably isn't quite the right term for it, but I get what you are saying. I wanted to set the mental/social stuff out, at least for now, along the same lines as the physical stuff simply because I saw no reason not to spread the love. However, I'm wondering what kind of flavor I could give such a game if the tactical war-gamey stuff was off on its own thing as a Battle/Conflict Mode, and then the more story-based cutscene type stuff had its own set? CRPGs aren't the best thing in the world to emulate for table top, but I think the "fun centers" that the gamey side and story side of such things engage -are- a valid split to explore. <br/>
<br/>
Though I wonder if it might have a negative impact on the playability of the game, I think having a set of Conflict Mode and a set of Story Mode mechanics with enough of a difference to make the division meaningful could be some good solid fun. I think I'm going to spend some time today working on drawing this out, but at the present I'm thinking of these as goals...<br/>
<br/>
1. Story Mode is where the setting and situation get fleshed out. Adding elements to the narrative, expanding existing elements, and moving events along should occur in this Mode.<br/>
<br/>
2 . Adding and expanding elements should use up some pool of points that is replenished by the Conflict Mode. Probably make this flow a two-way thing, with HP/MP (whatever I settle on calling them) recovery come from the Story Mode. <br/>
<br/>
3 . After the Conflict, there should be both an immediate investiment of said points in bringing whatever the stakes were into the narrative. This could be altering an element, eliminating it, bringing in a new one, whatever. The important thing is that the points don't just pool somewhere and stagnate. The conclusion of Conflict should give a kick to restart the narrative flow.<br/>
<br/>
4. The Conflict Mode should, ideally, handle nonphysical things either at least as interestingly as it does physical confrontation, or so inobtrusively that it doesn't matter. For this, I'm probably going to expand on the mechanic idea I posted about here: http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=361&amp;page=1#Item_13<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that should be a good grounding to work out from. Just what to do with those points I'm not sure yet if it'll be a direct comparison, a number of dice rolled or cards drawn, or what, but...I like the way these feel so far. I'll post something here after I get a microdraft done, and see what folks think. ^.^<br/>

<br/>
I've only seen the cover of the Nocturne game while digging into some Japanese RPG sites. That is a bit dissappointing to hear that about the game. Ah well, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Persona 3 trailer...wow. I knew about the Shadow Time thing, which is very cool, but I didn't know about the "summoning demons by shooting yourself in the head" bit. Awesome. The MegaTen games can be a bit friustrating and weird, but the concept behind each game tends to sell them to me. Persona 3 is definitely on my buy list now along with the new Shadow Hearts game, which is almost as fun a series as Persona, but with a touch more of that thing we call "sanity". Well, that and the Best Side Quest Ever: The Man Festival.                        </div>

                            Alright, after sleeping entirely too much today, here is what I have before turning in for the day, in general.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Stats</b><br/>
<br/>
(Lay these out on the points of a pentagram, Karma at the top for flavor, perhaps?)<br/>
<br/>
Stamina: Physical strength and endurance. The ability to inflict and take damage, leap fences, shoot straight, duck a punch, kick down a door, or give a friend a piggy-back ride.<br/>
<br/>
Lore: Knowledge and reasoning. Researching ancient relics, translating scraps of parchment in Old Latin, studying for a mid-term, solving a Rubik's cube, figuring out the solution to an ingenious madman's puzzle, spotting the trip wire before it triggers the bomb, programming a computer, or any other skilled task. (Blurb should ideally make it very clear that Ã¢â‚¬Å“professionalÃ¢â‚¬Â skills would go here. It does not, yet.)<br/>
<br/>
Composure: Conduct and social skills. Charming a courtesan, lying your way past the cops, defeating your opponent in court, or impressing the locals enough that they give you the good room at the fleabag hotel on Main.<br/>
<br/>
Will: Willpower, insight, creativity and spiritual strength. Pushing yourself past your limits, overpowering another's resistance, utilizing paranormal powers, sudden inspirations, artistic endeavors.<br/>
<br/>
Karma: The power of Destiny. Used to create elements in Story Mode, add to elements, or connect the character to an element. (I'm going to tie this into some stuff I have laying around for Mythos as regards setting Elements and their introduction. Probably going to wind up looking like do it yourself Lore Sheet type mechanics)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Story Mode</b><br/>
<br/>
In Story Mode, which can for this example be thought of as non-action scenes, the resolution is going to ideally revolve around Style Sheets, whose invocation will funnel points back into the four stats and allow characters to achieve things in scenes.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Style Sheets:</b> Basically, these are lists of Traits grouped by either subject or location. Starting a Style Sheet costs one point of Karma, and adding entries costs one per new subject. The rating of existing entries can be raised by spending their present rating in Karma on them. When invoked in a scene, the trait provides its rating to the side of a conflict that invoked it. Note that Story Mode uses conflict resolution, while Battle Mode will employ a more discrete Task Resolution system, to reflect...well, not sure what word to use for it at the moment, but mix "detail" and "keeping the audience's attention" and you'll be doing pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
What does a Style Sheet entry look like? Well, just about whatever the players decide to write down. While each Style Sheet will be named, the players will also be naming the sub-entries, so you wind up with something like...<br/>
<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>
<br/>
Arkham, Massachussets<br/>
<br/>
Miskatonic University 4 (Lore, Will): The University has an extensive collection of occult tomes and artifacts, along with a science department that has seen more than its share of the weird and wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Keziah's Home Cookin' 2 (Stamina): A greasy spoon joint just off the road in from Dunwich. Serves quite a passable tomato soup. Try not to order the coffee
<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>
<br/>
Before I go on, I suppose I ought to offer a defense of the Style Sheets, though it needn't be very long. Quite simply, it is mechanically rewarded color building. By creating these entries, both on themselves and on the setting and situation sheets the players bring into the game elements that they are stating they would enjoy exploring, as well as creating the means by which their tactical stats recover. You see up there after the numbers and before the fluff? That represents what stats can be recovered by tieing in that element. Tomorrow I'll work on breakind down the sub-entries into types based around what you have to do to have them "kick in". A Location, I imagine, would require a scene to be set there, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This is getting quite a bit large for a post, so I'll summarize the last point I was going to make for Story Mode and move on. Characters will each also have a Style Sheet in addittion to their Stats. Unlike other Style Sheets, this won't be how they recover spent Stats, but will instead be how they spend those points in the first place. Character development-wise, things can be added to the CSS just the same as any other Style Sheet.<br/>
<br/>
Forgot to include this up there, but tying Style Sheets together (like tying an NPC to their usual Location, for example) is done by spending Karma equal to the highest trait on each sheet in question.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Battle Mode</b><br/>
<br/>
What happens when it comes time to throw down? Battle Mode kicks in, that is what! Mystical duels, races to some goal, martial arts-fests, or even a healthy case of court room antics are all resolved with Battle Mode. Here is how I'm seeing things work at present.<br/>
<br/>
Characters spend their Stat points to activate their Traits. The value of all activated Traits on each side is split up according the Force/Finesse/Fortitude/Fallout setup I toyed with here: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=361&amp;page=1#Item_13" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=361&amp;page=1#Item_13</a><br/>
<br/>
Of course, this means that those numbers now have to mean something, and it is simply this: the overcoming number is subtracted from the defender's Stat value. So, if someone winds up with a value of 4 heading their way (after being run through the 4 Fs) , they knock 4 off the targeted Stat.<br/>
<br/>
Now, at present it looks the high end of stats is going to be the low to mid 10s, so that may not be too deadly. However, charactes fighting in an area that they aren't very developed in are going to be getting taken down relatively easily unless they exploit the strategy of the 4 Fs, which will in turn need some care taken to prevent it being a cheese-filled system.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing before I crash is Karma generation. The number of Karma earned from a Battle sequence is equal to half the total value of Stat points spent between all parties. In a Battle with multiple parties on each side, the Karma would then be further split up evenly amongst the participants.  Story Mode will also have ways of awarding Karma, so that non-combat monkies can still get their setting-building jive on.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that was a fair bit wordy, but hopefully it makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
