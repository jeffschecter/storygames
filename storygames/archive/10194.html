It looks like a fantastic game, easy to play and flavorful.<br/><br/>I know that a lot of people have played it, and I'm interested in their experiences. My main interest is the sorts of inter-party conflicts that are the core of the game; until someone dies, all of the conflicts are between the people in the story. I would suspect that a lot of these conflicts are social in nature, arguments about what is best to do at this moment, that kind of thing... and I'm curious if anyone would be willing to describe some of the cooler conflicts they've had in their ZC games, just to get my creative juices flowing. My fear is that I'll convince some of my painstakingly traditional group to play it, and they won't have any idea what to do with the ability to set up conflicts between themselves.<br/><br/>So, anyone have some cool stories/examples?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226432/#Comment_226432" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T03:08:13+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  3:08AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first conflicts in the game are usually pretty minor things with little at stake. This is not a problem, just let them ride; the resulting imbalance in board positioning serves to further motivate the players. Most often these conflicts are social in nature, they serve to illuminate the dominance relationships between the characters. Utterly mundane stuff - I remember one early game that started with two characters seeking to exit an elevator ahead of each other at the company headquarters. A more concrete example is when the movie began with a wrestling match between two player characters; the outcome came to weight heavily on the two through the movie.<br/><br/>Often early conflicts (before the zombies become a pressing concern, that is) are most important in what they establish as existing conditions that the zombies then disrupt. A very clear, simple example would be when a game started with what would actually be a mid-story situation in another genre: a father trying to compel a daughter into marriage against her will. Whether successful or a failure, such a conflict will influence the future decisions of both parties even if the actual marriage will never have time to happen with the zombies and all. It's often a good idea to start the game "in the middle" of a story that never gets to finish due to how the zombies come in and rearrange priorities.<br/><br/>Later on, when the characters become aware of the zombies and start being threatened by them, the most common type of conflict concerns leadership of the survivor group and plans made for survival. Ostensibly the conflict might be about whether we pick the left tunnel or the right tunnel, but in truth it's about authority, leadership skills and humanity: how individuals choose to push their opinions on others, what motivates them to disagree and so on.<br/><br/>Another typical conflict for the latter half of the game is clear antagonism: how overbearing the zombie thing becomes for the characters is very much a situational thing, it is not given that everybody is just going to discard their own priorities to focus on survival. The zombies might only plague an isolated community, for example, or a character might lack the foresight and wisdom necessary to act selflessly. Whatever the reason, sometimes characters end up championing their own personal goals that are more or less contrary to the survival necessities of the group. For example, a character might simply decide to push another character through a window into the waiting arms of the zombie horde. Or, less murderously, he might decide to focus on impressing the heroine instead of stopping the zombies.<br/><br/>In my experience it is pretty difficult to predict the exact type of conflict you'll get in a game, as that's one of the major degrees of freedom in the game. It's probably best to just trust in the group's sensibilities. I've only seen the game fail with players who were personally unable to understand what "creating story together by advocating for individual characters" means; everybody else seems more than able enough to invent appropriate conflicts when necessary.<br/><br/>Also, remember that you don't need to have conflicts in each scene. Just frame scenes that bring character qualities into light and let the group dynamics take care of conflict. Use your own character to provoke conflict to get less active players to join in as supporters. I've never had to worry about having enough conflicts in the game when I've played it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
