My idea with Microlite20  is that it can easily be played with little prep so I want to emphasize the on the go style of gaming. The box will be a small wooden briefcase style box with slide out drawers to store all your game gear. When the box is open it folds flush and locks to reveal a grid wet erase marker playing surface. This way you can have a play surface any place that can be used to draw up rooms and push minis around even at a park.<br/><br/>So my questions I had were:<br/><br/>Other than 2 pencils, a pack of wet erase markers, wet naps, two 8.5 x 11 hard backs, a folder with paper, and 2 sets of dice; what would you want to bring to game?<br/><br/>Would you rather have a small fold out surface that is the size of two d&amp;d books, or a full size brief case opened flat?<br/> <br/>Is this the stupidest thing ever and I should just not do it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263090/#Comment_263090" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-20T08:44:50+00:00" title="March 20, 2010  8:44AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't say dont do it, but I would question that the hippest thing ever is box sets. <br/><br/>They disappeared in dnd for quite a while and the new red box seems very experimental to me (like the little 32 or 64 softcovers they are producing for the races, and a few other things). While im certain there is a large amount of 'Daww Nostalgia Box'  I'm pretty certain price points are going to dictate your consumers more than if there is a box or not. <br/><br/>That said you box sounds nice, you may also want to consider putting a magnetic underlay under your erasible surface and shipping with some adhessive metal/magnetic disks so that you can actually do that play anywhere thing. <br/><br/>That said, If I was playing at home (or someone elses home. etc), space and supplies are not an issue, so it doesnt really sell it to me. Also if your briefcase size is anything like mine its fairly big, I wouldn't want to lug it anywhere, especially full of books and papers and stuff, which makes it an awkward torn between convience and completeness on the go, and actually lugging the thing on the go.<br/><br/>Anyway I hope that this helps, and you get to do that thing you want to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263231/#Comment_263231" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-21T09:47:31+00:00" title="March 21, 2010  9:47AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>I would question that the hippest thing ever is box sets.</blockquote>\nWell maybe not the hippest thing ever but as of late people tend to get pretty darn excited about box sets.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>you may also want to consider putting a magnetic underlay under your erasible surface and shipping with some adhessive metal/magnetic disks so that you can actually do that play anywhere thing.</blockquote>\nThat's a pretty awesome idea I will have to play around with that.

The smaller I am thinking of would be roughly the size of two standard d&amp;d books laying flat next to each other. <br/><br/>Thanks for the suggestions, hoping that gives you a better idea of what the size might be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263237/#Comment_263237" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-21T11:11:24+00:00" title="March 21, 2010 11:11AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really do like boxed sets.
