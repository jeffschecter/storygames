I'm starting a new game this week, and I've decided to try using intermissions: cut action and take a 15(?) minute break.<br/><br/>Now, there are normally breaks in my games -- but they more or less happen on their own. The difference here is making it more structured: deciding on the number of breaks and their duration beforehand, and letting players know about them beforehand.<br/><br/>I assume other people have done stuff along these lines, and would be very interested in hearing about their experiences.<br/><br/>Some things I've been thinking about:<br/><br/>One goal is to amp up the energy by letting people rest, and by letting them know approximately when they can rest. I'm a bit concerned about breaks sapping the momentum, however. Possibly either end with a cliffhanger, or lead with action after the break to retain/regain the momentum.<br/><br/>Another goal is to have people take care of their needs during intermission, as opposed to making more tea or taking potty-breaks during the game proper. How long should an intermission be? Just long enough for people to attend their needs, or a bit longer -- so they can get some table chatter out of their system?<br/><br/>How to slice up the session? One big break, or multiple smaller ones? One big and a couple of smaller ones? This depends on the length of the session, obviously.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233587/#Comment_233587" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T03:35:49+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  3:35AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In convention games, I like to take a five-minute break in the middle. It's for me, more than the players: it helps me recharge my creative batteries and coffee cup. I do this at the end of the scene. It can help cut short a flagging scene and come back to the next one with new energy.<br/><br/>Sometimes, the players look rather mystified when I do this. This happens especially during Cthulhu games, when there's a very slow burn, and if you break halfway through, they think: we can't break, nothing's happened yet.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233593/#Comment_233593" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T04:42:34+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  4:42AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of breaks.

It depends on the energy level and what is going on, but I would say that after the 90-minute mark you should start considering the break... if things are still rolling along full-force then you can wait until the two hours are up.<br/><br/>I think people tend to underestimate the effect of a focused, short break -- roleplaying can be pretty exhausting, and often a sort of mental myopia sets in as well (I hear some people call this 'immersion', <i>omgi'mhilarious</i>) that a brief break can help clear away. At the same time if your 'breaks' end up stretching into 30-minute diversions, that's probably even worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233604/#Comment_233604" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T05:55:11+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  5:55AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The standard I use is one 5-10 minute break every 60-90 minutes, even at con games (because I'm usually wired on tea, and need to take pee breaks anyway).
