These different reasons for play and anticipated rewards are called <b>Creative Agenda</b>. This is a strength, not a weakness, as diversity of play style gives us options and creates new possibilities.<br/><br/>When playing a game, being conscious of the reason you're playing, what's guiding your decisions and what you hope to take from the game session (in terms of an experience) is a good thing to do. This way, you'll be able to drive towards your own goals more intentionally, you'll be able to share your goals with others (who we assume want you to help achieve your goals), and you'll be able to evaluate how satisfied with a game session you are, with a clearer rubric.<br/><br/>When frustrated with a game, it's possible that the reason is that the people around the table are trying to get different things out of the game session. Perhaps you want the story to go in a different direction, or perhaps you want to focus on a different element of the holistic experience. Being clear about your Creative Agenda, and discussing what could be added to the game to achieve your Creative Agenda, might help resolve the issue. Perhaps the issue is actually that you're unclear about your own Creative Agenda, or your Agenda is unrealistic. Taking time to assess what you want and its viability is useful. The third possibility is that your Creative Agenda clashes with another player's, or the whole group's. Short of changing artistic goals (a sometimes unreasonable expectation), playing with a different group might be your necessary avenue of change.<br/><br/>When designing a game, be clear about what you want the game to do, in terms of the experiences you want it to create and the Creative Agendas that it best supports. You might have a very narrow intended experience (either with a constrained or open narrative structure) or a wide one; many supported Creative Agendas or only a single supported mode of play. These are all good, but if communicating them is a foremost concern then players of your game will be better supported in satisfying their goals, which results in better play. Finally, the structure and rules of your game should be designed in such a way as to support the things you say your game is about. Rules that are incongruent with the experience and Creative Agendas you want to support will create play experiences incongruent with play expectations. This is like baiting-and-switching, and should be avoided.<br/><br/><i>In other words</i>: Creative Agenda is a useful term. I personally don't see how Gamism, Narrativism or Simulationism are useful at all. This is my way of trying to take a heavy set of theory and make it concise, useable and malleable. Maybe this is a useful direction.<br/><br/>EDITED TO ADD: This is my attempt at saying "I hate most jargon" in a constructive, productive way... by adapting an existing discourse to fit the kind of language and communication I want to see used. So, yeah. That's where I'm coming from here. If someone finds this a useful direction, I'd love to break down some other parts of The Big Model, sockets, etc similarly.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207602/#Comment_207602" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T10:48:23+00:00" title="May 15, 2009 10:48AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So in a nutshell, you agree with the Big Model as a description of the roleplaying activity but disagree with the GNS theory?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207604/#Comment_207604" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T10:54:44+00:00" title="May 15, 2009 10:54AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I think the GNS theory is an excellent idea embedded in an unwieldy lead cage.<br/>To define <i>the </i>three Creative Agendas is unproductive.<br/>First of all, because discussing the borders of all three will not aide rewarding play, resolution of player frustrations, or design.<br/>Second of all, because saying there are exactly three, and defining them, leaves individuals at a disservice in finding their own preferences and exploring their own options.

What the GNS concerns itself with are agenda <i>modes</i>, which are groupings of agendas that are defined by the modeled sociopsychological structures depicted in Ron's articles - so Gamism, for instance, is defined by the Step on Up behaviour of competitive gaming. There are a multitude of Creative Agendae that fit within the Gamist <i>mode</i>, but that does not make them the exact same agenda.<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't find Joe's opinion particularly problematic. Perhaps GNS hasn't been explained to him well, or perhaps he doesn't find the definitions of the GNS modes convincing. No skin off my nose, and I can certainly understand how one might conclude that while CA itself is a real phenomenon, the GNS classification is not useful or exact or demonstratable enough to be considered useful. Usually when I see this attitude I also see a lot of focus on using GNS as a classification tool, so perhaps it's just that it's being mis-purposed there - I myself find GNS significant not because of classification purposes, but because it sheds light on the big trends in the sociopsychology of roleplaying; GNS does not classify roleplaying, it classifies the creative reasons people have for engaging in roleplaying. That is immensely useful for me, mostly because of how coherence (the property against which GNS classifies CAs) plays a part in successful gaming.<br/><br/>You've probably seen this, but I wrote <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2008/11/11/what-gns-theory-claims/" rel="nofollow">a short explanation of GNS</a> a while back wherein I tried to be very careful in differentiating between Big Model and GNS theory and in explaining what the latter exactly claims. If the difference between an agenda mode and a creative agenda seems vague, it might be an useful read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207643/#Comment_207643" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T13:30:53+00:00" title="May 15, 2009  1:30PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roger,<br/><br/>I think that "jazz" and "pop" are useful insofar as they aide communication, and detrimental insofar as they inhibit detailed, specific communication.<br/><br/>So, like... if I'm reccomending you check out Library Voices, which is an indie lit-pop band... If I say "indie" and you think Kings of Leon (which are often called "indie rock", a totally different meaning of indie), or I say "pop" and you think Pink! or Britney Spears (which are a wholly different meaning of pop), then those terms have just become detrimental.<br/><br/>So, "lit-pop" is a very useless term. Because it describes something quite succinctly, in completely opaque language that actually serves to impede communication. Now i have to spend time defining lit-pop, which will detract from my time spent describing Library Voices (a much more tangible and useful conversation), as well as open the floor to arguments and terminology discussions. It'd be more useful to say "they have a fun, spunky sound, use lots of guitar and accordian and keyboard, and take lyrical inspiration from Kurt Vonnegut and other modern writers".<br/><br/>I think that the moment something acts as a barrier to entry, its utility becomes really questionable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207646/#Comment_207646" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T13:48:29+00:00" title="May 15, 2009  1:48PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two brief comments: <br/><br/>I believe the state of the art regarding GNS includes both the deprecation of the one-word names in favor of Story Now/Step On Up/Right To Dream AND the conception that a group's creative agenda in practice is one of an infinite variety of "skewers" incorporating not just the three creative axes but their expression in terms of techniques &amp; social matrix. So yeah, G, N, and S each contain multitudes - they describe a central tendency or organizing principle for play.<br/><br/>A so-called "social agenda" is not, by definition, a creative agenda - because it has nothing to do with the imagined content being created. The game is merely an instrument for socializing, and no-one is prioritizing it <i>as a creative process</i>. Real, honest-to-goodness "social agenda"/"Cheetoist" play is to roleplaying games as kicking a ball around in the park is to playing soccer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207648/#Comment_207648" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T13:58:46+00:00" title="May 15, 2009  1:58PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe: Yeah!<br/><br/>So what we're building here is a map, yeah.  And the map is not the territory.  So it behooves one to build a map such that it serves the needs of the people using the map; that's all.<br/><br/>So if you're there and you say, alright, over in that direction is Story Now, and over in that direction is Right to Dream, and over in some other direction is Step on Up; yeah, maybe that's useful to the people using your map.  Maybe it helps them get to where they want to go.  Or maybe it doesn't; that's fine too.  In any case, the map still isn't the territory.<br/><br/>And maybe you build a vehicle and you decide, alright, this vehicle will be pretty good at going off in one particular direction.  That's fine.  And people can probably beat it into taking them off in some other direction, and that's fine too, if that's where they really want to go.  And if they decide to drive it off in some direction that no one has gotten around to naming yet, hey, that's their business.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207653/#Comment_207653" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T14:47:48+00:00" title="May 15, 2009  2:47PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WillH</cite>I think a lot of these people aren't just considering the game.

As a data point, my tolerance for social ramping up, breaks and ramping down exponentially increased when the games and people I was playing with started actually fulfilling what I wanted out of them.  As the games got more functional so did my participation in them *as* a social event.<br/><br/>Also, as usual, Eero, articulates the finer points of the theory a billion times better than I can.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
