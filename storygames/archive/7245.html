I've taken a bit of time in replying because I wanted to sit down and study Harry, so I could give a complete answer.<br/><br/>First, I think Harry makes a lot of sense with a little bit of context.  My understanding (Ron would have to confirm) is that that Sorcerer play testing was best described as Sin City meets Hellblazer as directed by John Woo (I even suspect this is where Harry's demon's name comes from).  Not all the kind of psychological character drama characterized by my own Southern Gothic game, Christopher's Kubasik's Brotherhood prison game or indeed any of the material suggested in Sorcerer's Soul.  So what we have here is a dude who's 2/3rds Marv from Sin City and 1/3 Fox Mulder from the X-Files.<br/><br/>I'll talk more about Harry in a minute but let's look at Woo.  Yeah, he's pretty much a bad ass gun.  When he comes out, people die, period.  Again I'm reminded of Gladys (Marv's gun from Sin City).  His Desire is Corruption so we're talking about something that's pushing Harry down the path of dirty cop.  Why follow procedure when I can just blow your fucking head off?  That Cloak ability is kind of a big deal.  I remember back in the day so many games being problematic because scenes in pre-scripted adventures required the GM to disarm the PCs first.  It usually pissed a lot of players off especially a lot of those trench coat wearing badass vampires for whom being the guy who suddenly pulled out a weapon from "nowhere" was part of the image.  Much debate ensued about how one could or could not effectively conceal a weapon.  Cloak presents an elegant solution to that problem. <br/><br/>Notice that Woo has Ranged.  Here's a subtle point:  Object Demons do not need demon abilities to function as the objects.  For example a demonic sedan does not need Travel and Transport to drive at 55 miles an hour down the freeway with four passengers.  So Woo does not need Ranged to shoot bullets.  Point 1: Without Ranged I probably wouldn't let the bullets be the source of the Lethal Damage which is kind of dumb for a gun weapon but might make sense for something else.  Point 2: However, depending on how Ranged is defined Woo can probably at least shoot through walls and around corners.  If you want to get super crazy Harry could probably shoot someone from the safety of his apartment, half a city away.<br/><br/>Back to Harry.  Looking at Harry's Price I see a man who shoots first and then asks questions and who would just rather tell the truth and get it over with than put up with all that covert bullshit anymore.   Thus its a really big deal when Harry does choose words over guns.  That's the kind of situations I see this man in.  From the elements of his back story this is what I'd prep as the GM:<br/><br/>An NPC who is a higher up in the secret program that Harry is a part of.  He's the guy who gave Harry the mission described in the Kicker.  I'd have to prep what he has against the mysterious sorcerer who helped Harry.<br/>I probably prep a non-sorcerous NPC who was part of the same program Harry was.  He's probably a little afraid and in awe of Harry.  I'd have to decide what his relationship was to the higher up.<br/>I'd probably prep a non-sorcerous FBI Agent whose curious about that secret program no one talks about.  He's probably had a case or two taken away by them.  Probably a case involving the mysterious sorcerer who helped Harry.<br/>Finally I'd prep the mysterious Sorcerer.  What's his agenda?  Why did he help Harry?  Why does the secret program want to eliminate him?  How does his agenda cross swords with the FBI in general.<br/><br/>So yeah, that all seems pretty awesome to me.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161188/#Comment_161188" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T10:50:03+00:00" title="August  7, 2008 10:50AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To quote a friend from when we were playing the Brotherhood Sorcerer game "Mechanics in Sorcerer only make sense in the context of the fiction". So yeah, this sorcerer is cool in the above game, cause he has context and a setting to fit into, on his own with nothing but some stats not so much.<br/><br/>Thanks for posting this Jesse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161311/#Comment_161311" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T18:39:39+00:00" title="August  7, 2008  6:39PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Harry has appeal for the average D&amp;D player out there who cut his teeth on dungeon-crawling.<br/><br/>He's the guy who's kicking in doors, kicking in heads, wasting <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">orcs</span> bad guys left and right.<br/><br/>What would I prep?  His coven, first and foremost.  I think that's where the real potential for Corruption is, among other things.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
