In some games, framing the scene is merely identifying the setting. In others it carries more weight, such as deciding what the scene is about.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Potemkin</cite>Is it like the wheel: It does with speed and efficiently what we ask of it so no further inventions are required? Will the hover-disc (to continue the metaphor) ever be practical?</blockquote>\nIn the <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">game that I'm designing</a>, I use the "chapter" as the basic unit of action. In literature, you generally have multiple scenes within a chapter, transitioning to a new scene with either the passage of time or a change of location. It's common in writing for a narrative thread to span scenes. I think the scene-oriented thinking in a lot of games comes from a focus on TV and film story structures. In TV and film, changing scenes is a big deal (new camera setup, new set, etc.) so they need every scene to deliver a certain impact. Switching scenes isn't as big a deal when it's just people sitting around a table talking, so I don't think gaming needs to follow the same rules as TV and film. I don't think my perspective is a huge change from a scene-oriented one (a single scene can easily span an entire chapter, after all) but I did consciously move away from talking about scenes because I found that the word "scene" had a lot of connotations in the game design space that it doesn't necessarily have in the fiction writing space.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249672/#Comment_249672" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T10:11:42+00:00" title="January  5, 2010 10:11AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great question!

I mean, we use it as a blanket term for a whole host of techniques that are pretty different from each other.  I was just thinking about this the other day and was going to write about it.<br/><br/>Sometimes:<br/><br/>1) One person throws out a "hard" framing, often in the form of a "bang," like: "Okay, you're in the water surrounded by sharks and you only have one air tank between you and your best friend.  Go!"<br/><br/>2) Sometimes someone floats a "soft" framing that gets further developed by the group, like: "Okay, what if we're underwater or something?"  "Wait, what about outer space!" "No, I like underwater better."  "Can there be sharks?" "Oh yes, definitely sharks.  And maybe there's a limited supply of air in our tanks."  "Oh man, what if there's only one tank between two people."  "Sweet."<br/><br/>3) Sometimes one person asks another person (or two) what they want to have happen, with specific constraints, like: "Okay, so we're going to have an interlude scene between you and your best friend.  Where does it take place?"  "Hmm, we should be in some kind of crisis together, where we have to choose between selfishness and our relationship."  "What about underwater, surrounded by sharks, with only one air tank?" "Done."<br/><br/>4) Sometimes you start with a "soft" framing and keep driving it, through play, until it gets to a "hard" crisis moment, like: "Okay, what if we're underwater, swimming through the wreck of an old ship."  [Play for a while]  "Sharks! Holy crap!  I struggle to get out of the ship and swim to the surface... [Play some more] "Okay, well, if I've lost my air tank to the sharks, then we only have one tank between the two of us!"<br/><br/>In all of these examples, the same contents happen, narratively, as far as the plot is concerned, but the way the group arrives at those places is very different and thus feels and means significantly different things during play.  And we haven't really explored that very much.  Also, there seem to be significant variation in approaching scene framing from an in-character or in-fiction perspective vs. an OOC, structuralist perspective, as in "we need a scene about their relationship" rather than "me and Mack are surrounded by sharks."<br/><br/>Additionally, there are all types of scenes that don't necessarily go "hard," arriving at a dramatic crisis.  Sure, they usually still have an important moment in them that gives the scene meaning, but sometimes you don't even know what that moment is except in retrospect, after playing out later scenes.  These have largely been explored either informally, outside of the concrete guidelines for framing scenes, based on the players narrative instincts, or through things like "interludes" or the "players turn" in Mouse Guard, which, like "scene framing" are blanket concepts that provide a minimal amount of structure, allowing players to be exploratory in play but not really examining the kinds of scene framing that are possible in crisis-free situations.<br/><br/>All that to say: there's a lot of meat there in scene framing and we have only really begun to explore it in a formal or mechanical way.  Previously, most of this stuff was very implicit or house-ruled or freeformed by local groups.<br/><br/>If you want something besides scene framing, or superior to scene framing, knock yourself out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249703/#Comment_249703" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T12:04:48+00:00" title="January  5, 2010 12:04PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's totally scene framing Brian.<br/><br/>All games use scene framing. It's a task, not a technique. "You're in a 10 by 10 corridor that stretches out at least 60 feet, to the limits of your torchlight." That's scene framing.<br/><br/>I think this thread is more about aggressive scene framing. Instead of playing out every moment, you use aggressive scene framing to elide time and place to go directly to something interesting. "A few hours pass. It's the third watch. Your head is beginning to nod as you struggle to fend off sleep, when you hear..."<br/><br/>Some games encode aggressive scene framing as rules rather than technique. PTA is an excellent example. There are many ways to do it, depending on the purpose of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249706/#Comment_249706" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T12:12:42+00:00" title="January  5, 2010 12:12PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Potemkin, I think scene structure permeates roleplaying so thoroughly as to be near invisible.

It does, however, encourage certain ways of thinking about how to interact with a story -- calling out scene boundaries as important divisions encourages thinking in a particular way about those boundaries and what happens between them. For example, people often get scene framing very tied up with stake setting and conflict resolution even though they don't necessarily have to have anything to do with each other. For some games, having exactly one conflict per scene (no more, no less) is important, and dictates the story pace of the games. In some games people assume that you ought to have exactly one conflict per scene, and there are discussions about whether you can or should have non-conflict scenes. If the game has mechanical emphasis on scene boundaries (such as by having the spotlight shift away from a particular character at each one) then that also impacts what happens in the scene (e.g. "I'd better do something with big impact in every scene I get!"), which influences the kind of story that gets told. Being "scene oriented" isn't god or bad on its own, but it does have consequences, which can be good or bad for a particular kind of play experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249712/#Comment_249712" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T12:26:59+00:00" title="January  5, 2010 12:26PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the responses, all.<br/><br/>I guess I can't think of ANY game where I don't frame scenes to some degree (from the oldest school to the newest).

Rules are mechanics in my book - it's all synonymous with 'System' (as opposed to 'Setting'). So a 'mechanical technique' is something specifically highlighted by the game's designer to happen in play (so, a rule. But 'rule' always sounds prohibitive to me..).

Scene framing is not just another word for description, it's a special kind of description -- you start talking about a new place or time or group of characters, but in order to do that you need to "frame" the scene so that everyone knows what is going on. This is in contrast to the old style of continuous narration of people walking down dungeon corridors, etc., which would be more like a film done with one continuous camera shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249766/#Comment_249766" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T18:00:18+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  6:00PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Dan's totally right.  Scene framing is a distinct way of thinking about the narrative of a game as explicitly being broken up into distinct pieces, like:<br/><br/>[scene 1][scene 2][scene 3][flashback][scene 4][interlude][scene 5]<br/><br/>Whereas, another way of looking at it might be a continuous narrative, where the GM is constantly asking, explicitly or implicitly, "What are you doing?"  And the main issue there is which parts to NOT play out, rather than which things to have scenes about.  So one of the main GM tasks in this style is to excise boring / unnecessary portions by fading to black or jump cutting between locations or in time. Like:<br/><br/>stuff happens // more stuff happens and then // some // other stuff happens... and then you decide to end for the night<br/><br/>When the GM does a lot of cutting or excising, you get something that is something like scene framing and, at least as I suspect, scene framing in roleplaying likely arrived from very proactive GMs who did a lot of excising and jump cutting for dramatic effect, to help create a "story" out of the events of play.<br/><br/>So, while I agree with Thor that some kind of shaping of the narrative happens in any game in which you don't have a narrative that constantly unfolds without cuts (and I'm not sure if any games actually do that, though I bet some larps / jeep stuff unfolds in real time), I don't think that "scene framing" as a concept is synonymous with "somebody has to describe what's happening."  It's more specific than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249772/#Comment_249772" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T18:41:26+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  6:41PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jaywalt</cite>...a narrative that constantly unfolds without cuts (and I'm not sure if any games actually do that...</blockquote>\nRectifying that <i> as  we  speak</i>(!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249776/#Comment_249776" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T19:17:39+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  7:17PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just expressing the term as it was defined when the idea was discussed and codified at the Forge.

All stories can be divided up into scenes retroactively.  For example, even in old school D&amp;D you can look at the story told, post play, and say, "That part where we fought the kobolds was one scene, and that other part where we traversed the swamp was another scene."  The real distinction at issue is games where the players consciously divide the action up into discreet scenes as the game unfolds, namely, through scene-framing.<br/><br/>Scene-framing is a technique, not a natural phenomena.  In D&amp;D, and many other games, the players moved through the story without break.  Even aggressive jump-cuts simply fast-forwarded the action.  These jump-cuts were not organizational tools.  Scene-framing, on the other hand, is used to organize the story into narratively meaningful sub-parts.  The players in a game employing scene-framing think about story structure differently.  The story told becomes about the sum of its parts more than one continuous narrative.<br/><br/>As stated in previous posts, scene-framing can be implemented in a multitude of specific ways (different requirements for description, conflicts, stakes, etc.).  I also personally believe that scene-framing is about starting (and possibly stopping) a scene, but not about defining the specific content of a scene (which should be left for actual play).  Whether a game uses scene-framing is a separate issue from how a particular game implements scene-framing.<br/><br/>Finally, some have argued that all games use scene-framing.  While I agree that even D&amp;D encouraged GMs to "set the scene," I don't think that calling this "scene-framing" is useful.  The advice in D&amp;D, and other similar games, is really talking about something else.  Describing what's in front of the player-characters is not the same thing as recognizing that the overall story will consist of discreet units.  Instead, D&amp;D was describing a basic function of all roleplaying games: the need to create a concrete shared imagined space.<br/><br/>Where things get a bit confusing is in certain "transition games" that call on the GM to do things like flashbacks and jump-cuts from time to time.  These games hint at the beginnings of what we now call scene-framing, but didn't really use scenes as a unit of organization during play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249909/#Comment_249909" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T06:48:43+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  6:48AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim C Koppang</cite>While I agree that even D&amp;D encouraged GMs to "set the scene," I don't think that calling this "scene-framing" is useful.</blockquote>\nWhy would it be, it's only what "framing the scene" means to everyone else in the world of movies, film, radio and books?<br/><br/>There is not an eye-rolling smiley that exists that is large enough and eye-rolly enough to express my feelings about this.

Defined in Sorcerer, I think (it's the first game where I have seen it explained), but I am not sure it wasn't defined before in other games.<br/><br/>- Games with a scene structure: games that have rules based on the division of play into concrete "scenes" with a start and an ending. One example of is this kind of game is Primetime Adventures. Examples of games without this structure: Sorcerer, Dogs in the Vineyard. <br/><br/>- "Scene framing authority": Who has the authority/responsibility to frame a scene? In many games is the GM, but other games have explicit rules about who can/must frame a scene.<br/><br/>- Scene framing fixed formats and limitation: some games have specific rules about the framing of scenes. For example,  in PTA the producer has to frame scenes that has a precise location and agenda chosen by a player. In Spione, the player of a principal who isn't already in a scene must frame a new scene for that character.<br/><br/>Now, these are very, very different things: talking about all these things together as they are the same is causing a lot of confusion.<br/><br/>The opening post talked about the third one, the scene structure format. If so, I simply don't see the same situation: I don't see "scene structure" dominating so much current indie game design.  If we don't count GM-full games (where a scene structure is, I think, inevitable, at least to mark every player turn start and ending), they are still the minority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249966/#Comment_249966" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T12:45:10+00:00" title="January  7, 2010 12:45PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Why would it be, it's only what "framing the scene" means to everyone else in the world of movies, film, radio and books?

There's a difference between having scenes and <i>emphasizing</i> that something has scenes. Poetry emphasizes the importance of things like word order. That doesn't mean that prose doesn't have word order (it would be incomprehensible if it didn't), but it isn't highlighted the same way it is in poetry. I think that paying attention to "scenes" is emphasized in many indie games, especially those games that center mechanics around it. This has consequence for the kind of stories that get told, in that it tends to push toward the kind of stories that have sharply delineated scenes, usually involving one important thing happening per scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249982/#Comment_249982" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T15:22:59+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  3:22PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim C Koppang</cite>In D&amp;D, and many other games, the players moved through the story without break.

I know exactly what you mean because if I were to play D&amp;D right now, I'd probably scene-frame too.  D&amp;D is inherently hard to nail down anyway because it has changed so much over the years.<br/><br/>But I think there is a difference between games that use scene-framing explicitly as a technique, as defined by the text, and games where players use scene-framing techniques regardless of the game text.  My point is that when people play in such a style that they're simply moving forward in time, describing everything from moment to moment (and I know I used to play this way back in high school), that's not scene-framing in the modern sense.  "Describing a scene," in other words, is different from "scene-framing."<br/><br/>(Also, please don't think I'm making value judgments here.

That question has a bit of history. Ron meant one thing by system when he laid out his "five elements" (setting, system, character, situation, color) but then Vincent/Emily "redefined" system to be the means by which the players decide on stuff happening, which includes lots of stuff beyond the formal rules.  Sometimes that newer definition gets retroactively projected back on the past, but I'm not sure if that's what Thor meant.  In the beginning, the "system matters" slogan was, I think, a reaction against "system doesn't matter" and, yes, was about the formal written game rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250018/#Comment_250018" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T22:18:06+00:00" title="January  7, 2010 10:18PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Z-Dog</cite>Thor O said: "There are still many people who think that the "system" in "system matters" means rules."<br/><br/>Whoa.

The lumpley Principle: "System (including but not limited to 'the rules') is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play."<br/><br/>According to the lumpley Principle, your group's system includes the rules that your group uses, but not the rules that your group doesn't use. System also includes any other methods your group has of agreeing to events in play, including GM fiat.<br/><br/>Because of this, when someone says "system matters," what it really means is "how your group goes about agreeing to imagined events during play matters."<br/><br/>I don't think that invalidates or contradicts anything in the original System Does Matter essay. I would also consider the definition of system to be more of a clarification than a redefinition.
