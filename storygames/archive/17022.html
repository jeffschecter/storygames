How do I choose? I guess that if I make it a faction, then I am declaring that it will always be an antagonist of sort. <br/>7/ When can you switch Handled PC? After a scene where you play the Controller?<br/>8/ Intro scenes -- do you do it mechanics first or fiction first? Do you roll and then make up how you get your successes, or you make up a situation and then roll to resolve it?<br/>9/ Is there a limit of one tick per character per Scene?<br/>10/ Correct Mindset -- since you can only push action forward as a Controller, is it better to always think about how make it tough for others rather than make it good for yourself?<br/><br/><b>Questions I answered myself from old threads:<br/></b><br/>- can you have multiple PCs in scenes/faceoffs? (YES)<br/>- max successes: always 3? (NO) can a PC with automatic success push 4 successes for a faction? (YES) can an edge dice push 4+ successes for a faction? (YES)<br/>- can you use successes to push up an attribute that didn't get a success? (YES)<br/><br/>thanks!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386862/#Comment_386862" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-11T06:34:35+00:00" title="August 11, 2012  6:34AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) Always, IMO. However, it's usually wise to keep you Edge for face-offs, where the reward for success is potentially higher and there's something on the line you're risking if you fail.<br/><br/>2) Always, IMO. (Pro-tip #1: it's not the end of the world if you sometimes forget to cross despite the dice asking for it. Pro-tip #2: you'll often want to create a cross with elements from a previous scene voluntarily, no matter what the dice say, 'cause the more interlinked the world the more fun you get from the game, usually.)<br/><br/>3) You don't burn PCons "for dice", you burn them for extra successes (before rolling) or re-rolls (after rolling). It's only edge dice which actually make you roll extra <i>dice</i>. Burning a PCon for an extra success means that you roll as usual and then, when counting your successes, you add a +1. How is that different from an extra die? First, it's always a success, no matter your Parameters. Second, as it's unrelated to Parameters, it allows a PC to obtain 4 successes, despite only having 3 Parameters (otherwise, PCs would be limited to 3 successes max., unlike Factions). Third, since the extra success is not assigned to a Parameter, it can't be spent to check or uncheck Goal boxes. Anyway, you can do it always, but it's more advantageous in face-offs (otherwise you're basically shifting points around your sheet with no gain).<br/><br/>4) I do.<br/><br/>5) I believe you keep it, of course. It's factored in at the end.<br/><br/>6) Do what makes sense to you. In my opinion, PCs are defined by being protagonist, by being "little people", independent and not just a mindless gear of the machine, and especially by <i>having an immediate Goal</i> (whereas factions only have the general goal of gaining more power). For a 1-person faction, I would still make this person act through their people, their servants, their links most of the time, and only rarely face-off squarely with a PC in the obvious sense \u2014 but that's just <i>me</i>.<br/><br/>7) At the end of your turn, yes. Thus, either after being the Controller, or making a Deal, or after introducing a new character (obviously, so that you have the option to take it as your PC immediately if you desire).<br/><br/>8) I don't usually specify a "conflict" in introduction scenes. Sometimes it's obvious the character's in motion and trying to obtain something, sometimes not \u2014 my general purpose in doing such a scene is to display (to the other players) who the character is. It's not at all unusual that I have to make up new scene elements after rolling, new advantages and opportunities which literally fall into the character's lap; it depends.<br/><br/>9) I don't think so.<br/><br/>10) To me, personally, the most productive mindset is to focus on the developing "story", especially trying to weave together the multiple storylines into one: to focus on crosses and on the reincorporation of elements. In a first episode, I'm not sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386865/#Comment_386865" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-11T08:21:30+00:00" title="August 11, 2012  8:21AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you Rafu.

Player Characters are motivated by short-term Goals which drive their actions, but this is much like Destiny Points in playing Archipelago or Issues in PTA, etc. If we were to think a PC achieving their Goal equals a player "winning" the game, then shared PC ownership would mess things up horribly, wouldn't it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387329/#Comment_387329" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-17T08:29:10+00:00" title="August 17, 2012  8:29AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah, I actually wonder about that. <br/><br/>During our game there was a sense of getting MY character to win, leading to players not releasing ownership.

And then there are characters who feel more like collective property and are more often employed as antagonists. Still, in my long-running game, this is not something the two of us have to agree explicitly about (we don't claim "this PC is exclusively mine" at the time we're introducing them) \u2014 it's more like an emerging property of the way one or the other plays a character or another. Also noteworthy is that there can be multiple "exclusively mine" PC per player per episode: it just happens.<br/><br/>I think that rooting strongly for one character to achieve their Goal is as valid a way to drive the game forward as any other. One of your scene options, namely the Deal, only really makes sense in this perspective in fact. But the book also explicitly says that when you use your turn as the Controller to frame a Face-off (which is, like, most of the time) you should be thinking of how to make somebody else's held PC's life more interesting \u2014 otherwise, you're playing the game plain wrong. ^__-<br/><br/>I've seen one "casual" player or two play RT "to win", and they had fun. But in the long run, I believe the charms of this game lie elsewhere, and if you consistently find yourself playing "to win" then you'll short-circuit it soon enough. Notice how Goal-achieving exists as a 100% mechanical thing, so that if you stop caring for believability and the intricacies of fictional positioning and just go hunting for checks in your boxes, well, then the rules are not exactly going out of their way to stop you \u2014 rather, they'll let you have as bland and uninteresting a game as you'll make it.<br/>If "winning" a game through the achievement of a character's fictional goals is what gets you excited, then I suspect that there are better options for you - games specifically designed to support that kind of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387334/#Comment_387334" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-17T09:56:14+00:00" title="August 17, 2012  9:56AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2012 9:56AM by ivan.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tried to play aggressively the past few times, but it felt sometimes a bit contrived.
