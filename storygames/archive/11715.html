From the look of it, they are still piecing their web site together, and the rpg portions are pretty slim; however, they just sent out a call for GM's to run games and such.<br/><br/>Who knows how this will turn out, but it seems like there is an opportunity to "set the tone" for independent games coming out of the gate for anyone inclined to do so.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
