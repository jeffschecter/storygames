But I understand that the quest system is very flexible, in that you can make a quest for anything and completing it will grant you XP.  This could be the normal "save the pricess" and "kill the monster" of course, but it can also be "run away from the monster" or "fall in love with the princess".  So, with that in mind, why not make a quest oracle?  You could base this off oracles you've already been working on, just add the XP value.  Or you could make up new ones for the new setting you want to make.  So, instead of a lot of structure, you draw however many elements fit for a given session, and plug them into a narrative (even inviting the players to help figure out how they relate).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141100/#Comment_141100" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T10:33:36+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 10:33AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. Make the setting sketchy. Don't in fact, work out a massive amount of material. Just enough that you like it, and it has the feel that you want (as opposed to having the kitchen sink feeling you mentioned). <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Allow players to have a hand in defining parts of the setting. When you do, this is a flag that indicates what they're interested in. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. Have play rotate around the characters. Quite simply, don't make up a "story" or "plot." Just make up events that happen that:<br/>\n A) Are presented in terms of getting the PCs reactions to them, and<br/>\n B) Give the player room to create responses as freely as possible. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, whether or not we're talking narrativism, I'm talking something like bangs, where you're focusing game events on giving players choices. To be sure you're doing this, always write out the question that the event asks the player to answer. If you know the answer, then rework the event until you don't know the answer to the question. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. Base these events around the "cool stuff" that you want to show them. Don't ask them if their character wants to go there, simply have that be the basis for play. Get your players complicit in this:<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: So I've got the baron's court worked out, and I want to move the action there. Please, each of you tell me the funnest reason you can think of for why your character has moved there. <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, in practice, when you play this way, you'll find that this is pretty much unneccessary. You can force characters anywhere you like, and players won't call it railroading as long as at the end of the move they have fun decisions to make. Actually, often the fun decision will actually indicate the plausible reason why the character is now there - again, keep these decisions about the PCs goals, dreams, and personalities. As long as the "Cool Stuff" you create keeps that in mind, then the players will love you showing it to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can show them the most interestingly developed fantasy terrain imaginable, and they will yawn if there's no decisions to be made about it. But say, "The corridor splits off, left and right" and suddenly you're a genius. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. If you don't like raise and teleport, etc, don't allow them. Does this unbalance some classes? I rather think not. <br/>\n<br/>\nBetter yet, stop playing an RPG that includes such abilities, and play one that allows magic to be what you want it to be. But that might be off topic, sorry. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n6. I don't understand your last point at all. Can you elucidate? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141113/#Comment_141113" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T11:03:06+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 11:03AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been following (in a general way) Mike's methodology for the SWSE game I'm running now, and\u2014combined with the new 4e-influenced rules\u2014it's honestly the most fun we've had with d20 in a long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141125/#Comment_141125" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T11:59:53+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 11:59AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2008 12:04PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>I need to find a way to let the players explore and see more of the world, because I want to show them the cool stuff I made for them.<br/><br/>Biggest hurdle: I don't want to write sessions.

You fight rats in the tavern basement and deliver packages across town so that you can see what it's like to fight and figure out where people live in town.  This is the great benefit of the zero-to-hero progression of classic D&amp;D, that you don't have to know shit about the setting because you can't possibly affect (or, often, be meaningfully affected by) a lot of the setting, and you can learn the setting as you go.  Create little objectives first, short trips, easy conversations with people who want to help if they are but asked properly, etc.  Then as you add complexity, add setting elements. <br/><br/>Not sure where you're at on the second one.

Like, what happens if you do ceremorphosis on an Umber Hulk?<br/>Okay, I'm thinking in terms of sim design school here. In those terms maintaining the integrity of the imagined space is paramount.<br/><br/>Are you sticking with all the other crap - the adventure prep, level scaling and all that, because to simply remove it would collapse and cave in the whole idea of umber hulks, demogorgon and so on?<br/><br/>I'm not about to suggest ditching it all, because if it is part of maintaining the intergrity then indeed it has to be there. I support you having it if it's needed to maintain the integrity. However, from my understanding of sim design, certain changes can be made if everyone agrees to deny they're changes and instead just small clarifications.<br/><br/>I'm taking some pretty broad steps in suggesting this, so that increases the chance of being off quite alot.

Does the phrase "face the dungeon" ring a bell for you? If not, I'll have to do some searching. I believe the discussion was here, but may have been on the Forge. It might be just what you're looking for.<br/><br/>As for setting creation, have you looked at a setting like Near, for TSoY? It's a very fine example of how you can write fairly limited material that nevertheless provides limitless avenues for play. You don't have to prep a lot for fun gaming. You just have to make sure that as close as possible of 100% of your prep is actually going to affect play (as you did with your TRAPs). Setting is very much the same (I guess something like Near is the Narrativist equivalent of TRAPs).<br/><br/>If you're thinking more in terms of piles of items and monsters, then I'd say you should ignore setting, or let it evolve, and go with something more like a lock-and-load approach--random draws, etc. Your Ultimate Oracle, or whatever you call it, could be a good model. After each adventure, every player writes up one new element based on something they saw in the last adventure. Something they would like to see more of. Put those elements in a pile. For subsequent adventures, draw from those elements to create the situation.<br/><br/>I'm rambling, I know. .It's late. Let me know if any of that sparks anything for you.

Crazy One-Man World Design very often leads into GM as Movie Director, simply as "setting design creep."  That's why my earlier post--which reflect an attempt to actually put the West Marches design into practice--suggests finding very specific places to go hogwild with design, while specifically marking off other things as off-limits to the GM.  My particular line-that-cannot-be-crossed may not be yours, but it's important to draw it: otherwise the players won't appreciate they have a field of creative endeavor beyond biting the latest worm on your hook.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141369/#Comment_141369" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-26T12:51:49+00:00" title="April 26, 2008 12:51PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks James - I see what you mean now, and yeah, I need to draw some hard lines for myself (like: Write the past, write the present, don't write the damn future).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141390/#Comment_141390" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-26T18:29:43+00:00" title="April 26, 2008  6:29PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2008 6:33PM by James_Nostack.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, for me, even writing about the past was too inviting - but I did use your TRAP method to flesh out a region in a fun little way, beginning with a Dragon's Hoard, and expanding out to other stuff: a goblin-army in the dragon's service, a town cut off by the dragon's depredations, merchants trying to get food to the town, bandits raiding the merchant trucks, a doppelganger feeding the merchants bad route information, etc.  By the time I had 20-40 of these, I called it quits, statted up the "stickiest" NPC's (i.e., those most enmeshed in the situation and thus the jumpiest when adventurers come near), and then went about designing dungeons.  I don't know if that will work for you, but as a GM I definitely feel like there's no "plot" that I'm forcing on anyone.  It's just a dynamic environment, where everyone can see how the house of cards will fall if you tip them.<br/><br/>(The "hidden variable" stuff that GM's like to play with, in a lot of ways removes player incentive to create plot because there's always the "juicy parts" which they will never see until the GM decides he's good and ready.  So, I put all the cards on the table, just as a way to control myself.  there might be better solutions but I don't trust my judgment on the matter yet.)<br/><br/>My suggestion would be to tie all the cool stuff together with some large-scale TRAPs, and see how that looks, building lots of connections for interactivity.

Then you say that you don't mind session prep. <br/>\n<br/>\nEither way, it doesn't matter. Your goal, so you say, is to get out of the rut of GM-run plots. This is, in fact, precisely what the techniques I'm advocating are intended to do in play. They work incredibly well. The more prep you put in, the better they work, but they work well even with relatively little prep. So no matter how motivated you feel to prep, it's always easy to be ready with enough to make play go well. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically items 3 and 4 above. Frame the action to your cool world locations, and immediately give the players decisions to make. Then allow play to go wherever it will go based on their decisions. Once the players see that the decisions that they make drive where play goes, then they will drive play. It is, in fact, players who see that it doesn't matter what they do, that the play will go as the GM directs, that lose any interest in trying to make decisions. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll you have to do is to give them decisions, and be sure that there's no obvious answer to the decisions. And, once they've made those decisions create new decision points from the situation as it has now changed. Make these decisions matter to the players, by making them all about the elements of their characters that interest them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe usual technique for figuring out what decisions are interesting is to look for "flags" on the character. Does player A's character kick all ass in combat? Then he's likely looking for tough fights to participate in, and tactical decisions. Give him combats in which the player can find creative ways to use his character abilities to overcome. Don't come up with a set answer, the "right" way to win this combat. Simply have the situation be complex enough that there's no obvious answer. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf another player has it in his character background that he's a member of the wizard's guild, have the guild ask him to to partake in something that's potentially unethical, like taking money for charlatanism (casting an illusion of a dead wife, instead of really putting the grieving husband in contact with her). Tests his ethics, and his allegiance to the guild. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the character in question refuses to perform the unethical act, then have the husband come to him directly and beg, showing that he's in deep pain. Does that change the wizard's mind (do the ends of putting the man at peace justify the means in this case)? If the wizard does the ritual, have him become famous for this, and have lots more people come to him for help. Does he come clean? Does he continue to do more fake readings? Does he declare that he's lost the power? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm saying may sound like I'm saying that you should prepare by making a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book. And it is, insamuch as prep will assume certain things about the current situation, like where it lies between sessions. But what's interesting about RPGs is that players are free to make up any response. In the case above, the player may decide to pay the husband to not tell anyone that he can't do what the guild claims he can, and then gives money to the guild, telling them that he did the ritual (this way he stays in good with the guild, and doesn't have to do anything unethical with regards to the husband). <br/>\n<br/>\nAs such, you can't prepare everything for this sort of play. Once this happens, however, you can extemporize by looking for flags again. You note that the player also included a girlfriend on the character sheet. So, knowing that he's blown all his money on silencing the husband, and paying off the guild, you have her come with a financial need. How does he explain being broke to her? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a simple technique checklist you go through when setting up a situation: <br/>\nA) What question does this ask the player? <br/>\nB) Do we know what he'll answer? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the answer to B is yes, then retool the question until the answer to B is no, we don't know what the player will do. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe real question with B is, "Do we think that the player will see one of the answers to the question as an obvious one that he has no choice but to accept." But the short form usually works as well, since we really can't know what the player thinks perfectly. What's more, it's often more important that the choice be non-obvious to the observers, because this will make it entertaining, the player will be rewarded with smiles, and he'll feel that he's been successfully creative. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny better? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141478/#Comment_141478" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T09:37:14+00:00" title="April 28, 2008  9:37AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Ryan... you say you don't want to do session prep, at first, because it means you won't end up playing, because you won't do it.

It's hard to say whether 4E will have better tools to help this along (like using the quest system to help the players be active in plot generation), but whether it does or not, it should just be a matter of using general techniques that remove the need for GM written plots in traditional games that people were honing in the 90's before indie games came along with more directed tools.<br/><br/>Briefly, develop Antagonists with their specific goals and agendas, and use relationship maps to make sure those goals overlap and cross paths with the PCs' agendas.  Start somewhere between "just before" or "just after" the PCs have their paths crossed. Encounters and maps you develop are the puzzle pieces to fit in and back drop where all of this takes place. You are basically preparing what will happen if the PCs don't do anything - i.e. how the Antagonists get their way. And I suppose the antagonists don't have to be NPCs (although they always have been for me). It could be anything from an erupting volcano to ruins leaking malevolent magic, just so long as it's active.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141508/#Comment_141508" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T12:27:18+00:00" title="April 28, 2008 12:27PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>The more prep you put in, the better they work, but they work well even with relatively little prep.

At least, good encounters require a certain amount of calculation and set-dressing that, for me at least, isn't always easy to just impro. It's less of an issue in SWSE (Star Wars Saga Edition), but there's still some number-crunching you need to do to make sure you're not throwing anything that's too easy or too hard at the players. Add in cool terrain and hazards, and it just plain works better if you have time to prep first. It looks like 4e will make encounter design even easier, though, which is good.<br/><br/>The SWSE game I'm running now has been following Mike's guidelines for the most part, but I have noticed that the encounters (in terms of choice of opponents) that I prep in advance have been more fun than the ones I was winging. Prep, in this case, being stuff like generating typical level-appropriate squads of stormtroopers. Environment has still been pretty improvised.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141518/#Comment_141518" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T13:20:47+00:00" title="April 28, 2008  1:20PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Buzz that classical d20 as it's designed is like a toolbox set for amusement rides, fights with interesting sets and foes whose special qualities combine to test all the class features and 'builds' of the party in good old 'gamist' fashion etc.   My beholder fight will rock because I've designed it's lair and buddies accordingly, etc.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141523/#Comment_141523" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T14:20:30+00:00" title="April 28, 2008  2:20PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>I agree with Buzz that classical d20 as it's designed is like a toolbox set for amusement rides, fights with interesting sets and foes whose special qualities combine to test all the class features and 'builds' of the party in good old 'gamist' fashion etc.   My beholder fight will rock because I've designed it's lair and buddies accordingly, etc.</blockquote>\nRight! The DM in my old Monday game cooked up these incredibly challenging encounters with very weird monsters, but he put in a *lot* of work pre-session. Doing anything cool with templates and class levels requires number-crunching that just can't be done on the fly; not by normal humans, at least. The DM in question is probably one of the biggest brainiacs I know, and even he was getting worn out by high-level encounter design.<br/><br/>Anyway, my whole point being that Mike's technique (which is also basically Chinn's web/flag-framing style) doesn't really work for good D&amp;D-style Gamism (something Chinn admitted as well, IIRC). At least, it seems like it doesn't work as well, to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141548/#Comment_141548" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T18:33:31+00:00" title="April 28, 2008  6:33PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2008 6:38PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, have you read Chris Chinn's "Flag Framing" and "Conflict Web" essays? That's the sort of stuff Mike is talking about--not preparing events and scenes ahead of time. <br/><br/>It's kind of like how IaWA creates a scenario without actually saying anything about what will happen... how does it create story without writing any adventure prep? All you need to do is create an unstable situation--i.e. conflict. Once you have that, *something* has to happen, and will, especially if you keep putting pressure on it. You don't have to prep any story/scene material. You don't have to write any "chapters".<br/><br/>The IaWA method is a shorthand for creating conflict and unstable situations. With 4e, you'll have to develop your own method, as the GM (with as much or as little help from the players, but more makes more fun and less work), for getting tthat unstable situation.<br/><br/>For example (off the top of my head):<br/><br/>--Have each player write up one goal their character is pursuing, *at this very moment*. (It's NOT backstory. It's what the character is doing *right now*.)<br/>--For any two given PCs, create an NPC they each know. This NPC supports PC A's goal (wants it to happen--it's in the NPC's Best Interests, to use a IaWA term), but wants to stop PC B from reaching their goal. I'm sure a million ideas will come to mind as soon as you pick a pair of PCs and think about their goals for about two seconds.<br/><br/>This gives you your starting "dramatis personae"--X PCs, plus one NPC for each PC pair. To start the game, just frame a scene where one of these NPCs (pick one at random, if you want) takes action towards one of their Best Interests--either provides a character with a means to move towards their goal, or tries somehow to stop one of the characters. <br/><br/>After that, the game should roll by itself, if you follow Mike's advice. If it ever stalls, and none of the players are chomping at the bit to suggest something, pick a different NPC and frame another scene the same way (just like the opening scene). <br/><br/>What do you care about in prep? Basically just: "What does this NPC want from this PC?" That's your "TRAPs" for your situational/relationship map. Of course, you can write "Bangs", as well, but they'll be gravy at this point, not necessary.<br/><br/>However... D&amp;D might make some of this difficult, especially if there is still such a strong reward for killing things, and no good system for non-combat conflicts. In this case, you'll have to create your setup so that there are lots of opportunities for combat. For example, each of those NPCs could be a powerful person or creature who sends troops, demons, assassins, or minions to get what they want. The PCs will find themselves faced by groups of combat-ready characters who want something from them, or want to stop them from doing something.<br/><br/>The PCs might agree with some of them and do what they want, negotiate with some, and fight others. As in one of the posts towards the end of the "face the dungeon" thread, the combat system will act to resolve conflicts. In play, it will look like this: "After we defeated his Elite Guardsmen at the Bridge of Kazan, the Baron was sufficiently impressed that he decided to cede to our demands, and finally agreed to lend us the map to the Unmapped Reaches." Does that make sense?<br/><br/>As for keeping the challenge level consistent, you may need to do some clever and flexible prep. For instance, consider creating statblocks for opponents that can used for more than one type of foe. For instance, you might have something like "stats for group of 20 enemies suitable to a party of level 5: customize by adding one special power for Chapter 12 and assigning an appropriate skill to their +6 skill slot." Then, when instead of the Duke's guards, the PCs decide to fight the demon assassins, you just pick up those stats and add the "Shadow Flight" power or whatever, from your list (even better, there'll probably be something like this in the 4e texts that you can use).<br/><br/>That'll be the challenge--creating encounters you can throw at the PCs in flexible ways. But that should be quite doable, I would think. You can use all the old tricks, like create maps of places without defining where they actually are until the PCs encounter, etc.<br/><br/>At least, I think I would do it something like the above. I haven't played D&amp;D in ages, so I don't really know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141550/#Comment_141550" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T18:54:47+00:00" title="April 28, 2008  6:54PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2008 6:55PM by Valvorik.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I loved Chris Chinn's essays on this, they're online at:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/collists/waystoplay.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/collists/waystoplay.html</a><br/><br/>But I do think that it's tough to use D&amp;D (at least 3.5) in that kind of spontaneous play.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141554/#Comment_141554" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T19:25:14+00:00" title="April 28, 2008  7:25PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, his Flag Framing and Conflict Web essays postdate those, though, and are more up-to-date/state-of-the-art/what-have-you.

In traditional D&amp;D these come up almost by accident (e.g., sooner or later we find out views of mercy to fallen foes, prisoners, keeping word to let someone go if they spill the beans etc.) but issue being that traditional D&amp;D play produces bangs haphazardly and biaised to those that spill of out of combat, usually making a character 'banged out' long before level 20.

That's why it seems like more work to me (and it won't solve my problem with plots).<br/><br/>Ryan,<br/><br/>I've played with Mike and I think you're getting the impression that Mike comes up with all those plot points and questions during prep before the game.  I don't think that's the case.  He probably comes up with the 1st plot point/question for each character and that's it.  Since he doesn't know what the player will do, he really can't go much past that.  All the others he comes up with on the fly based on the player's moment to moment decisions.  So, he method is significantly less prep than the traditional way.  Normally you'd write out a session's worth of adventure.  Mike might jot down 1 sentence per character in his spare time.<br/><br/>**Mike, if I'm misrepresenting you, let me know.  I think I'm fairly accurate though.<br/><br/>Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141700/#Comment_141700" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T09:06:54+00:00" title="April 30, 2008  9:06AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew is perfectly right about how it works. You don't write the whole "choose your own adventure" book. You just write the first choices for the next session. Something like "Elf princess asks Rhakleth (Gareth's character), who has fallen for her, to tell her the military plans of Green Lake. Does he help her, while possibly undoing the security of Green Lake?" <br/>\n<br/>\nOften times, once play had been going on for a while, I would actually show up with no prep done whatsoever. Zero. This is, in part, possible because I don't have to come up with bangs alone, the players do it to each other. Often times all I end up having to do is framing two characters or more into a scene with each other, and sit back and watch what happens. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I say Bangs here, to segue into the next point, which is that, yes, for my game, using the techniques in question means creating bangs. But, as I tried to make clear above, Rob, Bangs have characteristics specific to them that promote Narrativism. If in fact what we want is more tactical play or something else, then the more generalized technique doesn't include things like making sure that the situation presented creates a moral or ethical quandry or otherwise challenges value assumptions. It could merely be a tactical question asked, for instance. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose you could call this a "Gamism Bang" or something, but I think that's a useless jargon creation. It should suffice to call the general technique "Creating interesting decisions" for players to make. Banks being the localized narrativism promoting version, and the general techniques for doing so are the same across the board. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor isntance, if we know that a player with a torch will use it to destroy a monster that's known to be susceptible to fire, then putting that monster in front of the torchbearing character isn't at all interesting tactically. If, instead, we note that this is their only torch, and that using it to destroy the creature will use it up, leaving the character in the dark for the rest of the dungeon, now the player has a choice to make, and an interesting one. There's your "Gamism Bang." <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that it's often possible for interesting tactical choices to have actual right or wrong answers. In fact, for them to be challenges, they probably have to have these, at least in a theoretical fashion. Often we determine if the player did well by the end outcome of events. The point is not that there can't be a dominant strategy (to use the Game Theory terms), but that this strategy has to be non-obvious. In which case we laud the player if they do discern it. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor simmy play, you might have situations where the questions asked are very much "What if?" sorts of things. What if the character with the magic relic ends up at the temple that claims it? How does that interaction work out through exploration? <br/>\n<br/>\nGetting outside of GNS preferences, we can look at questions of characterization. The question could be, "How does the character act when put into a public speaking situation?"<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, in all cases, you look for flags from play or on the character sheet or where ever you find them, and create questions around these things that you feel interest your player in working out, in whatever manner they are interested in working them out. To allow for player creativity, you make the answers to the questions non-obvious. Then you take the results of those decisions, and make the situation of play reflect those decisons, so that the player feels that his contributions are having a real effect on the direction of play (since they are). <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, the big benefit to doing this well is that players become more and more proactive as they discern that when they make decisions that they actually have an effect on play. They start to search out more decisions, create them for each other, and even create them for themselves. And then your job becomes really easy. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141719/#Comment_141719" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T10:13:52+00:00" title="April 30, 2008 10:13AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, I your GNS side-discussion might be very helpful, but I'll need to feel it out:<br/><br/>I thought you were talking past me - you seemed to be suggesting a different way to prep interweaving narrative character/story choices that result in unexpected directions for the game.  I really think D&amp;D isn't suited to that kind of play.<br/><br/>However, if you're trying to tell me just to make sure to design a bunch of encounters with real tactical choices... that I get.  You can run across the bridge but it's rickety, you can burn the bridge but the enemy's artillery might be better than yours, you can shove enemies into the chasm but then it's easier for you to get shoved yourself.  <br/><br/>But I'd still say that D&amp;D isn't the place to expect that to be a minimal-prep game.  At the very least I'll need set pieces and some pre-established world to make those choices (which direction do we go in the wilderness, how deep are we going into the dungeon, what do we do in the bridge fight) real choices, rather than "it doesn't matter where you go, the next dungeon will have a bridge fight."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141743/#Comment_141743" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T11:32:01+00:00" title="April 30, 2008 11:32AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know that this is helpful, but honestly I plan on playing 4E exactly the way it appears to me to be designed to play.  I'm going to spend exactly 0 time creating...in a MMORPG the stuff's already created and that's the model 4E seeks to emulate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'm going to get me the set of 3 adventures by Mike Mearls et.al that take characters from 1st to 10th, and we're going to play those...until we either finish them, or get sick of it which ever comes first.  Then I'm going play something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy prep is going to consist of 1) learn the basic rules, 2) read ahead the next "chapter" (or whatever) in the published adventure, 3) learn the special rules for that part of the scenario, 4) figure out how to present those rules to a group who's generally not a fan of lots of special case rules, and 5) play right from the book, winging it where necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur relatively brief play sessions should ensure that games don't get too far ahead of my ability to keep up with them, but I am relying here on the two key assumptions that 1) 4E really is streamlined and elegant with consistant rules applications, and 2) the published adventure not only doesn't suck (which from Mike is probably a safe bet) but also presents the adventure in an immediately useful format that doesn't require a lot of extra work from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I figure in an MMORPG you don't get to invent your own quest.  You find a group to run through whatever quest the programmers already invented...so why not just go with that and see how it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141801/#Comment_141801" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T07:35:22+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  7:35AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, sorry for taking so long, but I think that I'm now seeing your problem a whole lot more clearly.Let's verify. Is your dilemma this:<br>\n<br>\nA) I want to use the stuff that I prepare, because I want them to get as much fun out of it as it potentially possesses for the work that I put in, and I want them to see it, so that they can appreciate it, but<br>\nB) I don't want to force players to run through it all, because doing so, forcing plot, is bad for play. <br>\n<br>\nOr is it worse than B, is it that you feel that it's artificial or even bad to force players to do anything with their characters? <br>\n<br>\nYou're setting up the old insoluble connundrum. Which is, "How do I railroad my characters to the adventure without railroading them to the adventure?" <br>\n<br/>\nSomething's gotta give. For one, if in fact you're only concerned with tactical play, then I'd posit that "plot" is meaningless for you. That is, go ahead and force players to the dungeon. Like say, "OK, play starts with the four of you outside of the Pit of Doom, ready to go in and seek adventure. How do you proceed?" If what the players are looking for is tactical fun alone, then getting them to the dungeon is doing them the favor of skipping any of the stuff in which they're not interested. <br/>\n<br/>\n"Dungeon" here being shorthand for "what I've got prepared tonight for tactical fun." In fact, the more explicit you are with this, the more this sort of player will be comfortable with this. Once in the dungeon, give him free rein to do as he will, this is the creativity that the player seeks, and will appreciate you for getting him to it, without having to go through the painful process of playing out the pre-prepared plot that doesn't allow them any choice, and is going to end up at the dungeon anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, on the other hand, by "plot" you mean making thematic decisions, then I'd posit that the "Face the Dungeon" method is fine. That is, let the dungeon be a fun tactical exercize that determines the success or failure of the character's non-tactical choices. Do I chase the Black Knight, or go save the Princess? Either way it leads to the Pit of Doom, but I've gotten to push the plot forward, and creatively displayed my character, and so have gotten to create plot. Plot is not "where we go" but it's "what important choices my character has made, and what that says about him" at least in this context. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you don't have to do this as grossly as "Face the Dungeon." You can simply "illusion" the same results (even if the illusion is an open fact). That is, instead of the player having to figure out why we're going to the Pit of Doom chasing the Black Knight, you as GM come up with a plausible reason why this is where the Black Knight is fleeing, and not the other foes carrying off the princess. If they go the other way, you rationalize the opposite. Since the player's choice was not intended to create a tactical advantage one way or another, it doesn't matter where the characters end up - only that the goal is what they chose. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you're not comfortable doing that, if you want player choices to mean what they "would mean" given the hard world that you've created, then... well, yeah, you're hosed. There's no solution to this problem. But I'd argue that you've put yourself into this spot, and unneccessarily. Whatever it is that you think you're getting as a benefit to play from this arrangement doesn't nearly counterweigh the obvious problem that it's creating for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what uncle Ronnie calls "The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast" the GM and players can't both control the same plot elements at one time satisfactorily, if they both want to control them. Only one side is making the actual choices, and only that side can be getting the satisfaction of having made those choices. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141831/#Comment_141831" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T09:12:29+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  9:12AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>A) I want to use the stuff that I prepare, because I want them to get as much fun out of it as it potentially possesses for the work that I put in, and I want them to see it, so that they can appreciate it, but<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> I don't want to force players to run through it all, because doing so, forcing plot, is bad for play.</blockquote>Are you saying that exploration of a dangerous environment is a doomed enterprise?

for:<br/><br/>(I'm hoping your answers will clarify where wires have gotten crossed in this discussion.)<br/><br/>1. You give the players a premise/setting. "You are the only survivors of a shipwreck on the Isle of Wights."<br/><br/>2. You ask each player to name one thing they're seeking as part of this premise/setting. "I set sail searching for my lost love, who was lost at sea two years ago." "I have come to the island to slay the Beast of Arrrgh."<br/><br/>You tell the players that, a) whatever they say they are seeking is something that is actually on the island (the characters don't know that, but the players have your guarantee that their goal can be reached, here, now), and b) they have committed their characters to searching for the object of their goal.<br/><br/>3. You design obstacles, enemies, traps, dungeons, etc, that stand between them and their goal. Figure out how said obstacles can be relevant to what they're looking for. (e.g. Slaying the Beast of Arrrgh will be incredibly difficult without the Incantation of Ra, which they can find by raiding Quagnor's Tomb, etc.)<br/><br/>Use the "Face the Dungeon" approach to see whether each character gets the object of their goal or not.<br/><br/>You can find clever ways to use material they skip, if you really want to be economical. For instance, the players ignored Quagnor's Tomb, which you spent hours on, and have found their lost love, killed the beast, etc. But... the only way off the island is the magical pool at the bottom of Quagnor's Tomb.<br/><br/>4. Once this is done, the players chat and decide either a) what goal they want to pursue next, in which case you tell them which geographical area they need to travel to next, or b) they just pick a spot on the map they think is interesting, in which you brainstorm a rationale for them to head there, then start over at the top (#1).<br/><br/>Note that, like Mike says, you, as the GM, are effectively "writing the story". Kind of like a computer game. It's a little better for the players, though, because they get to set the starting point and end point of the story. If that's enough for them, and enough for you, that could satisfy everyone.<br/><br/>So, which parts of this suit your needs and which grate? Maybe then we can zero in on what you're looking to avoid, exactly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141870/#Comment_141870" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T12:49:04+00:00" title="May  1, 2008 12:49PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2008 1:00PM by Ry.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The order of operations grates, as does some of the other assumptions.  As I write this Ben Robbins' West Marches writeup is in the back of my mind, because I think it solved the problems in my first post.  <br/><br/>1. I design a baseline setting - a set of maps and random encounter tables ("Random Encounters Tables" are an ancient form of Oracles that you tie to a place instead of a theme).<br/><br/>2. I give the players a premise for their entry into the baseline setting.  <b>"If you come out to the game,</b> you are the only survivors of a shipwreck on the Isle of Wights, <b>but on the island you have a chance to find your fortune."</b><br/><br/>3. Players chat and decide either a) what goal they want to pursue next <b>and how they intend to pursue it</b> or b) they just pick a spot on the map they think is interesting.  <b>I can veto places or plans that are boring, but then they - not I - have to come up with something else.</b><br/><br/>4. I design <b>additional</b> obstacles, enemies, traps, dungeons, etc <b>to compliment what I've already done for the way they're headed.  I don't design it around putting a certain number of obstacles in front of them to make the session a good story.  Instead I use some basic principles of how the setting fits together.  For example: The deeper you go in a dungeon the harder the monsters get.  The bigger the dragon, the bigger its hoard.  Places that are difficult to reach are more dangerous and contain better treasure.</b><br/><br/>So I'm (in reference to the first post)<br/>- Making a setting full of cool things (random encounters and fleshing out the places the players want to go to).<br/>- Letting the players explore and see more of the world, which lets them see the cool stuff I made for them.<br/>- Not writing what will happen.<br/>- Picking a level range that works for me (although I think I'm going to let the whole damn 1-30 roll).<br/>- All creatures from the Material Plane are unaligned<br/>- Rolling dice.  I'm not sure I ever got this one, but I use "Players Rolls all the dice" and tend to GM rather theatrically so I stand up a lot.  I'm going to sit my ass down and roll dice and move minis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141873/#Comment_141873" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T12:59:06+00:00" title="May  1, 2008 12:59PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/><br/>That sounds cool. Does it meet all your criteria, or is something still missing?<br/><br/>The knowledge that you have cool stuff prepared may be more than enough incentive for the players to explore new places, for instance. Kind of like exploration in a computer game.<br/><br/>I still kind of wish you could be more forthright with what grates/goes against your ideal of play, since that makes it easier to suggest solutions you'll like. But, if you're happy with what you've got, I suppose there's no need.<br/><br/>Finally, just out of curiosity, what is it about rolling the dice that is important to you? Why is it a significant factor in your future 4e game?

Haven't you? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with it is that there's a "Then Magic Happens" step that'll never occur. And that's step 3. Where the players, sans any input, suddenly decide that they have goals, and how to go off and get them. And where, worse, you can veto them. The first time this happens, they're going to look at you like, "OK, Mr. Knowitall who asked us where we wanted to go... you decide where we're going!"<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn't certain before, but I am now. You're searching for that magical sort of play called, "My players finally act the way I've wanted them to act forever, doing the work of creating plot for me." <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, it doesn't exist. Not playing D&amp;D it doesn't. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that's not to say that you have to shoulder the burden entirely yourself, in fact I don't like that sort of play. What I'm saying is that you have to pose the questions that get the players moving. "What are you going to do next?" is not sufficient. I tried that question for two decades, and never got anything more exciting than, "I guess I go look at swords in the market." <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I'm here to tell you that there is no way to do this that involves you not participating. As long as you control what's interestingly detailed in the world, you have a lot of control over where the game goes, and abdicating it is not an option. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I have something. Make up two dungeons. Or more, but you need two to start. Then come up with a question for the characters to answer in terms of plot, that comes down to "dungeon A, or dungeon B?" in effect. As I've indicated, make the question actually interesting to the players, one they want to make. They pick a choice, you play that dungeon. <br/>\n<br/>\nNext session, make sure you're back up to two dungeons you can use at least (heck, you can reuse some). Ask a new question that amounts to "dungeon B, or dungeon C." <br/>\n<br/>\nWait, they already rejected B! you cry. Well, sure, but the reasons for going there may have changed, or may stand differently in contrast to the first question. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, to use my by now hackneyed example, you ask first session, "Do you follow your leader as he pursues the Black Knight to A, or do you follow him as he pursues his lady love to B?" Sure this spotlights the leader character, but the other players can haggle with him, and that might be interesting play itself. Maybe the party splits, and you play two dungeons at once!<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's say they chase the knight to A in session one. When you come back, you can ask, "OK, now that you've captured the black knight, you could go after the princess, but the duke is asking if you could take care of the dragon that's at Cave C." <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, after the players decide to have thier charactes take on the dragon at C in session two, in session three when you pose the D or E question, the characters might actually decide to go back to B and get the princess. If you add two new locales each week, and only play through one, the player's choices will grow significantly over time, each one with a resonance as to why they might want to go. Eventually this context may produce proactivity in the players, and they may ask to go to Z, which you haven't enumerated yet. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the only "plotting" you have to do is come up with an interesting choice between any two of them each week. That's two dungeons (which it sounds like is no problem for you), and one interesting question per week. Can you manage that? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141886/#Comment_141886" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T14:25:31+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  2:25PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2008 2:27PM by Eric.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>3.

You're building a house. You have most of it completed. You ask someone else to add something - but they haven't seen the whole place, just a little snapshot. They say, "how about a bay window here?" You don't like it, since you've seen the whole thing and don't actually like bay windows anyway. You ask them for another idea - without giving them any real agency or information. They either continue guessing until they pick something that you were going to do anyway, or they go do something else instead. <br/><br/>A choice that can be arbitrarily vetoed without the equalizing possibility of override isn't a genuine choice. If I ask my wife where we should go for dinner, if I tell her it's up to her, and then I say, "no, that place sucks, try again," she should <i>kick me in the shins</i>, because I'm being a <i>bad person.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141888/#Comment_141888" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T14:54:42+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  2:54PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2008 2:56PM by Ry.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't tried it, but Ben Robbins has in his West Marches game, which I mentioned in posts 13, 20, 32, and 54.

That makes it sound like an unimportant detail, possibly included only as a formality to handle edge cases.<br/><br/>I have no idea how often you intend to use it, either. I do know that your point 3 is 56 words long, including all the formatting like a) and b), and the line about vetoing is 21 of those words and <b>in bold text.</b> That makes it look like an important thing that you see as a significant component of the setup.<br/><br/>I also have no idea how much fun Ben and his crew had. I do know that every single time a GM has ever used a veto option even vaguely resembling that in any of my play groups, interest and creative input ground to an immediate halt. Some people seriously do play "Mother May I" as adults and enjoy it (clever wording is usually key), while others base dysfunctional relationships around it. It's not my bag, and I find it annoying when someone's good-faith creative input is being unilaterally discarded. That's not something I associate with mutual respect. Other people roll like that for years and have a grand old time. I can't speak from their perspective without some mental contortion first.<br/><br/>So, if Ben and his crew are anything like the people I play with, then "they had tons of fun" says to me "Ben didn't veto much, if at all." Or maybe his vetoes were affirming and positive in tone - "Hey, that sounds pretty neat, but I don't know how I can pull it together for us for this game. Could you toss some more ideas around for me, or maybe give me another perspective on what you're current idea is?" Anything but "that sounds boring, try harder" hitting the mailing list several times per week.<br/><br/>As for deliberately misreading you, whatever. You'll know if I start trolling you when I post image macros. I jumped in precisely because the conversation had reached absolutely surreal levels of disconnect. Thus, there's a <i>very</i> high chance that I'm misreading you, but it's not deliberate and I'm not trying to get your goat. I seriously am just grabbing anything I can find that I can hang my hat on, and simple declarative sentences in bold text do the job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141890/#Comment_141890" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T15:32:50+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  3:32PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The bold was simply to show my text as separate from what Paul wrote.  <br/><br/>More important I think is how players are involved in the organization of sessions in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141891/#Comment_141891" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T15:35:34+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  3:35PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2008 3:41PM by James_Nostack.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;deleted for redundancy&gt;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141900/#Comment_141900" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T16:21:32+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  4:21PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Ryan's proposing is really simple, eminently possible, and not crazy, magical, absurd, impossible, or immoral.

Of course, to make it used one must railroad or have Players who graciously acknowledge "well, Rob spent time creating that dungeon so I guess we'll go into it" (assuming you're not using ones you got from Dungeon Magazine etc.) and effectively thus "railroad themselves", which is nice of them (I've seen that) but still kinda boring for htem.<br><br>It's more work if per the 'dungeon' itself embodies choices and is not a "linear line of rooms" or something so close to it that it might as well be (e.g., the analysis of dungeons as flowcharts that show some are pretty linear and some have more diverse routes around in them).<br><br>I think if you move D&amp;D to low prep/player responsive etc., you move away from the "dungeon" as historically conceived and into more a "scene, set of connected scenes" kind of game.<br/><br/>I also think Ryan is likely very good at running that sort of thing (having played in a game where he did just that, it was to get into dungeon at some point but it sputtered out before then, it was still interesting for what it was).<br/><br/>Rob                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141920/#Comment_141920" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T18:34:47+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  6:34PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2008 6:37PM by Ry.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>it sputtered out before then</blockquote>Yeah, this game is meant to address the two big reasons that that game sputtered out: <br/><br/>1) I had to promise players a 'fun time' to get them out to play.  Sandy, Rob and I met as gamers first and foremost, and they wanted to game.  The rest were old friends or coworkers who said they wanted to game but their level of commitment wasn't in sync with what they said.  From my perspective the group was more than a little dysfunctional, with me having to nudge three or four players until they came out.  <br/><br/>I hope to fix this by making players responsible for agreeing a mission and scheduling the game (something I know Rob wouldn't have any problem with and Sandy is itching to do this for this game).  That way anybody at the game is interested enough to be there, not doing me a favor or anything.<br/><br/>2) I took the initiative away from the players.  On the way to the dungeon Rob mentioned, a friend of theirs came up and gave them a "you have to do this now" mission.  I remember saying I was burnt out on dungeon building, but after a lot of other play and reflection that wasn't accurate.  I was burnt out on sidling a patron up to the players and sending them on a mission, and therefore being responsible for that mission's challenge level, rewards, and general entertainment level, because now the players were playing roles in my story, and I was writing a session's plot rather than a sandbox for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141925/#Comment_141925" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T19:42:47+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  7:42PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/><br/>Could you present your setting in terms of conflicts and situations that the players can decide to sides in, without pre-writing plot? That could help.<br/><br/>What I mean is, you follow this idea where the players schedule sessions with a goal/destination in mind, based on a "setting" you've prepared, but you present your setting is a dynamic one, with many "tempting bits".<br/><br/>Instead of "the hills to the North, which were formerly a Dwarven capital, founded during the reign of Boobley the Fourth...", you come out and say, "the hills to the North, where a sword of great power was unearthed by a bunch of adventurers. They were cornered by a tribe of nomads, and threw it down a deep canyon. The tribesmen now hold them prisoner, but are faced by a phalanx of Dwarven soldiers, who arrived minutes after they did. Both want the sword, but neither wants to climb down the canyon first, making themselves vulnerable to the other side." (Your TRAPs method will come in handy here.)<br/><br/>The PCs could hear this as a rumour or just take it as metagame information. You could present all the locations at once, "frozen in time", or just give them rumours about three or four of them after each session, in which case things will seem to be less static and more "alive".<br/><br/>The interesting part is that the players can make a number of choices about *what* they want to do, as opposed to just *go there* (in which case, once they get there, you're back to writing the adventure for them). They can tell you that they want to sneak in and retrieve the sword, or that they want to help drive away the tribal warriors, or rescue the adventurers, or start a big battle between the tribe and the dwarves as a diversion, or side with the nomads and do something nasty to the dwarves, and so on.<br/><br/>In each location, there is some situation, treasure, terrible problem, or what-have-you that provides an opportunity for the players if they step in. You could even set it up in a thematic way, as appropriate for D&amp;D: for instance, each location or event contains a choice between preventing evil or of gaining great wealth/power. Maybe the tribesmen are burning down a nearby village, but if you try to stop them, the dwarves will get the sword before you can get there, or...<br/><br/>If your setting is logically constructed, as you seem to plan on doing, the repercussions of their actions.will transform the implications of future sessions (the dwarves end up harbouring great anger towards the PCs, which means they will now want to go to that other place and help the minotaurs stop the dwarves from overrunning *their* ancestral home, etc).<br/><br/>So, is this more *hit* or more *miss*, based on what you're looking at?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141952/#Comment_141952" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-02T02:07:15+00:00" title="May  2, 2008  2:07AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2008 2:07AM by Ry.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be honest, that's a hit, but I really don't need help with that anymore.

My previous example was kind of nar like (not nessersarily nar, but narartivist themed I think). I'd like to just outline a rough example for three agendas.<br/><br/>1. You put alot of prep in, and the princess declines the proposal at the end. The game is called the suck because of this.<br/><br/>2. You put alot of prep in, and due to how circumstances turn out (heavy winter, deep snowfall, echo resonance...), an avalanche occurs that completely destroys the caravan and (say) all the PC's gear stored there (simply because that's where it was stored - it's circumstance/causality). It would just turn out that way, but its called the suck cause it wrecked everything.<br/><br/>3. You put alot of prep in and the players lose - and they mope and act like it sucked. Bad losers. Or alternatively you put alot of prep in, they win, then treat it like it was completely ephemeral and nothing to them. Bad winners.<br/><br/><br/>In each case, the WEIGHT of all that prep pushes you to go against what OUGHT to happen.<br/><br/>This sets up what I think is a writers block situation, because the writer applies force against himself. It's railroading yourself as you do prep - railroading yourself down the track you think will make your players happy. The princess accepts the proposal - railroaded. The avalanche never happens - railroaded. Difficulty is turned down (or up) - railroaded.<br/><br/>We know what it's like to be railroaded in play. And here in prep, the work and the quire legitimate need for payoff is setting up the prepper to railroad himself. A direct analogy would be were movie producers, because of the vast sums of money involved, rewrite the ending of a movie because the test audience  weren't happy with it.<br/><br/>Or in short, I think you can apply force to yourself/railroad yourself. Just outlining the idea in case it sparks some interested discussion <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142341/#Comment_142341" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-04T21:17:48+00:00" title="May  4, 2008  9:17PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's the old thing about prepping what you'll use, versus using what you've prepped.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142572/#Comment_142572" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T21:21:24+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  9:21PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, it isn't (in terms of what I refer to). The princess example is probably clearest. <br/><br/>Okay, with real life glove puppets, the puppet is imaginary, right? But it's your hand inside - if you stick the puppet in a blender, your hand gets blended. That isn't imaginary at all - it's not just happening to some imaginary character, your hand is indeed being blended.<br/><br/>Now, the princess here is a puppet. It's an extension of your mind as much as your arm is an extension of you. Now, would you resent being forced to make a certain choices? Even if the princess is an imaginary character, when you force her, you force yourself - just like when you put the imaginary puppet in the blender, you blend your own hand.<br/><br/>Tying this back into prep - the massive amount of prep involved prompts this force, while the disconnection between the writer and the character makes the writer think they can apply force as they wish. Or in other words, makes them think they can stick the glove puppet in the blender with impunity.<br/><br/>It's actually that last bit that'll make it hard to swollow the whole idea - cause it's "Just an imaginary character!", as if the imagination isn't part of your body like a hand is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6378/what-i-have-to-do-to-make-4e-fun-for-me" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6378/what-i-have-to-do-to-make-4e-fun-for-me" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6378/what-i-have-to-do-to-make-4e-fun-for-me/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F6378%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F6378%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
