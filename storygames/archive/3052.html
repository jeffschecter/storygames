God how I love thee. I grew up with Space Hulk and genestealers and all that stuff. Truly tense stuff.<br/><br/>I think you're right, Dead of Night would work quite nicely for an Alien/Space Hulk style affair, although I wonder whether Terminators might be a bit too hard to fulfill the role of victims. Colonial marines on the other hand - they have cannon-fodder written all over them.<br/><br/>Tweak survival points slightly so they represent things like running out of ammo, the motion detector going bonkers and your npc teammates getting dragged off into the air ducts.<br/><br/>Tension needs to start low but spike suddenly, before dropping again. So maybe insist the GM spends at least 2 or 3 at a time to rapidly drop the tension after an encounter. I guess you're looking to encourage aliens that keep coming back for more, so maybe use tension for protect and assault checks. You're also looking to keep people on the run throughout the ship, so maybe use it for escape checks too? Or you could use it for identify checks so the marines know something's coming ... just not what.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since I played X-Com - I guess it'd be similar in places. I'll think on it some more though!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rumble" title="rumble"><img alt="rumble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguegames.com/DONlone.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rumble">rumble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70569/#Comment_70569" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T23:08:59+00:00" title="May 19, 2007 11:08PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I've never actually played Space Hulk or X-Com, perhaps you could explain the two settings a bit?

The 'combat' part of the games focus on lots of relatively simplified but challenging tactical movement, lots of 'we can see them on the motion trackers, but WHERE ARE THEY (all three examples have motion trackers hardwired into them), and a pretty damn high mortality rate for the soldiers, if the aliens are allowed to get the drop on them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rumble" title="rumble"><img alt="rumble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguegames.com/DONlone.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rumble">rumble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72495/#Comment_72495" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T16:15:58+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  4:15PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the delay. Real life, yada yada. <br/>\n<br/>\n"High mortality rate"<br/>\nOne of the most wonderful phrases for any horror aficionado. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, you need to determine the priority for the game. I'd settle on two or three Attributes (not Attribute Pairs), max. Your priorities can even change from session to session.<br/>\nDetermining priorities helps focus Tension where it's needed -- it helps define Circumstance. <br/>\n<br/>\nHigh mortality rate or fewer aliens &gt;&gt; Assault/Protect pair.<br/>\nVictims can't hide from or find the monsters, or don't know what they're up against (e.g., baby alien) &gt;&gt; Identify/Obscure pair<br/>\nVictims can't run due to overloading, restrictive environment or mission guidelines &gt;&gt; Pursue/Escape pair<br/>\nVictims suffer interference from politics/red tape/technical complications &gt;&gt; Persuade/Dissuade pair.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, you determine how much of an impact those areas have on the game, and what Tension rating you want to maintain. You don't need a whole lot of GM control (Tension points) if you've got 20 aliens following 2 hapless PCs. With 1 alien vs 10 PCs, suddenly you'll need those Tension points to hit them where it hurts. With more active aliens, your Tension rating will be artificially high -- but you won't necessarily have (or need) Tension points to spend. It's a quantity vs. quality of monsters issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity establishes the ambience of the game. If you restrict yourself to 1-2 points at a time, you leave the players largely in control of their own fate, and you have to be very picky about where your points will have an impact. 3-5 points at a time starts to balance out the picture, and more than 5 points at a time puts you firmly in control of the dice at key points in the scenario. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor Mood, the more cinematic the game, the more liberal you can be with discretionary Survival Point awards. If you're interested in a really grim game, you should be very stingy with Survival Point awards. I'd say no more than 1-2 per scene (total), not including mandatory awards, such as I Did It! or I'm Still Kicking. <br/>\n<br/>\nQuick tips: <br/>\nFewer aliens, more Advanced Specializations; more aliens, fewer Advanced Specializations. If you've got one or two dozen aliens running around with Indestructible and Assimilation, your PCs will turn into a pink frothy paste far too quickly. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a LOT of aliens, you've definitely got to put Vulnerabilities into the mix -- especially something like Insignificant, if we're talking about a large ratio of monsters to characters. The Aliens movie (second in the series) was much like this. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's my best advice: Get creative with Specializations. <br/>\nExample: Many times in the movies, the Corporate Representatives underestimate the alien's capability and underequip or ill-inform the protagonists. Give the alien a Disinformation ability under Persuade/Dissuade. The ability manifest through the in-game Bureacracy, but that doesn't really matter. The PCs are really up against the alien, for all practical purposes. If the PCs fail their conflict check, they ALL lose equipment or vital information that reduces all their Survival Point values (ouch) in the long run. Since the alien's ability comes directly into play, even though the alien is not present, the alien can also dictate whether this is a Persuade/Dissuade or an Assault/Protect conflict check (barring Vying for Attention, of course). <br/>\n<br/>\nI apologize for using so much connotation-laden terminology here, but it was just faster. I also didn't have a copy of my book with me, so I couldn't put in page numbers where appropriate. If you can't find the topics I discussed in the book, let me know, and I'll provide page numbers or clarify as needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
