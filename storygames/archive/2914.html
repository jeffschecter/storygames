What advice will help me bring the awesome when I'm playing HERO or GURPS?<br/><br/>My initial offering: A recent post on John Kim's blog pointed to <a href="http://ptgptb.org/0027/theory101-02.html" rel="nofollow">a general article on "The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast" over on Places to Go, People to Be</a> that paraphrased Ron's idea of "GM as bass player."\n<blockquote>In this resolution of The Impossible Thing, the referee controls the story in the sense that he sets up the world and the situation, and so decides what the story is about and where it begins; but he does not control how it ends, or how it reaches the end, because that depends entirely on the choices made by the players expressed through their characters. In the end, the story will be as much a surprise to him as to anyone else.</blockquote>\nAnyone have any other ideas or pointers?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66186/#Comment_66186" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T11:46:49+00:00" title="April 30, 2007 11:46AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya,<br/><br/>My favorite kind of Sim is exploration of Situation.

The players I'm with these days dislike anywhere near that level of mechanical complexity.  <br/><br/>I think a lot of the HERO 4th edition books have pretty good advice.  I have an <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/gametext/herosystem.html" rel="nofollow"><b>excerpt</b></a> from the 5th edition main book.

That means in play you beat up your vampire for a while before staking it, so perfectly emulating the source material.<br/><br/>In Feng Shui, there are mook rules so you can wade through hordes of faceless opponents.<br/><br/>In CoC, your sanity declines over time as you encounter more lively awefulness.<br/><br/>All these are "sim" mechanics, but for very different sorts of games.  Admittedly I don't find sim a useful term, but even leaving that aside the breadth of play is such that no unified approach is really possible.  Am I missing the point of your question?<br/><br/>The above are all sim mechanics, the core of them is they aim to help achieve the feeling of the relevant genre in play, though supportive mechanics can actually get in the way of course too sometimes.<br/><br/>Illusionism is not IMO a CA dependent issue, one could easily have illusionist gamism in which the challenge is illusory rather than real.  I'm not sure how one could have illusionist nar, but with all the creativity out there I'm sure it's doable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66293/#Comment_66293" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T06:33:22+00:00" title="May  1, 2007  6:33AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>FWIW, I've been rereading Ron's original Simulationism essay, and there's lots of good stuff in there.

The GNS Sim descriptions generally don't appeal to me, but games I play are typically labelled Sim.  At times, I'm concerned with detail, but as for what is detail vs. minutia is a matter of taste.  For many people, long historical novels are loaded with minutia and boring, but others are intrigued by it.  <br/><br/>I've got tons of Actual Play stuff, but it tends to not get talked about much.  Over the past five years or so I've gotten much better at documenting my campaigns: cf. <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/campaigns/" rel="nofollow"><b>Campaigns page</b></a> and my <a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/tag/actual+play" rel="nofollow"><b>"Actual Play" tagged LJ entries</b></a>.

What issues do you have?  When are there problems?</blockquote>\nI'm in a regular HERO group that meets biweekly. We rotate GMs; it's mostly two other guys, but I've been doing a Star HERO game (which you helped me with a lot!) that we rotate in every few sessions.<br/><br/>My main issue is plain ol' boredom. <br/><br/>With one GM, I can tell that he's basically moving the goalposts and that our input doesn't really matter a whole lot. It also makes for very rules-light play, effectively, which makes playing one of the hobby's most complex systems, HERO, seem pointless to me. Combats tend to be quite boring, protracted, and ultimately predetermined.<br/><br/>With the other, we seem to always be focused on minutiae that's just of no interest to me. Whole sessions go by dealing with our superteam's PR reps and reporters, and the GM rolls for stuff like, "Let's check the reporter's Acting to see if he loses his composure during the interview." This goes on for hours.<br/><br/>When I first joined the group 3-4 years ago, I was sure this was awesome RP'ing. Over time, though, it's just worn on me. Play seems to vary between aimless and pointless, with occasional cool moments now and then, very much the "20 minutes of fun in 4 hours."<br/><br/>We've done three sessions of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1994&amp;page=1#Item_36" rel="nofollow">the HERO game I posted about a while back</a>. The first session was pretty weak, as I documented there, but the second session (when I was able to make use of your advice) was pure awesome the whole night. The third session returned to general boredom.<br/><br/>I'm trying to mostly focus on situation and being a "bass player." The second session this worked, but the other sessions it seemed really easy for the players to just diverge on tangents that just seemed pointless to me. E.g., one player trying to convince another player's android assistant to assert its rights as a citizen. The android isn't really in my control (the player paid points for it), so I don't want to dictate its reaction. My attempt to "cut away" ("Okay, you continue your conversation with the android; meanwhile...") was basically rebuffed, as these players apparently like sitting around, talking in character about subjects that HERO provides no means to resolve.<br/><br/>Anyway...<br/><br/>I'm just trying to seek out techniques to  "bring the awesome." I'd like to find some middle ground that will give me and the players what we want. I guess I'm also trying to decide if this is just a player thing or if it's really HERO's issue... which would suck, given I have 4-5 feet of shelf space devoted to the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66381/#Comment_66381" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T12:20:42+00:00" title="May  1, 2007 12:20PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Marco Chacon's<a href="http://www.jagsrpg.org/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=5" rel="nofollow"><b>Fault Tolerant Design and Execution</b></a></blockquote>\nInteresting that <a href="http://www.jagsrpg.org/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=7" rel="nofollow">the follow-up essay about scenario design</a> is veering into Nar...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66450/#Comment_66450" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T15:02:18+00:00" title="May  1, 2007  3:02PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            buzz, do you think you can ask the question without the GNS association, please.

I.e., tailoring the scenario to the PCs, as well as tailoring the PCs to the scenario/campaign, adds to the feeling that the game "makes sense." This would seem very important to maintaining the "Dream," as it were. I know that the most die-hard Sim guy in my HERO group is often bugged when settings or situations lack consistency. Ergo, I'm thinking that anything that bolsters the integrity of the experience is good Sim.<br/><br/>This is obviously less important with Gamism, as exemplified by the typical D&amp;D "module." The dungeon itself is kind of a ridiculous concept, but it makes for great challenge-focused play. Of the flip side, Nar would seem to care more about whether the situation pushes everyone to address premise. Setting integrity takes a back seat.<br/><br/>Second, that you're going to need at least a little plot in addition to your situation. Given that, in your typical GURPS, HERO, or BRP game, the players are not empowered by the system to create plot for themselves (if anything, it can be antithetical to typical Actor stance), the GM is going to have to do it. Both the essays on the JAGS site and some of the better D&amp;D adventures I've played point to having some sort of overarching plot or timeline that marches forward unless the PCs act to thwart it. "Plot" here translates to, as a D&amp;D article on WotC's site put it, "What happens if the players do nothing." The nice thing about this is that since it's based on the non-involvement of the PCs, it's not a "story" that the GM overtly/covertly pushes the players through. It's just the gears that continue to turn in the background.<br/><br/>This thinking also jibes with my poor experience using Nar techniques with my HERO group (though I was also doing a poor job of them, too). My players were totally stymied when faced with a bang, but are totally happy going off on tangents <i>if that's what their character would do</i>.<br/><br/>Or am I just totally off?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66802/#Comment_66802" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T15:20:06+00:00" title="May  3, 2007  3:20PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite>More seriously: what makes "good Sim" looks, to a lot of people, like Nar.

However, if they are motivated to change things and have the power and knowledge to accomplish such, then they can generate plots.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66811/#Comment_66811" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T16:01:04+00:00" title="May  3, 2007  4:01PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2007 4:03PM by Marco.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Buzz,<br/><br/>The article's not about playsibility--it's about <i>alignment</i>. It's about prioritizing <i>alignment</i> between Players and GMs (the real people) in the <i>traditional</i> model of play. That is, the Players and the GM are, through the vehicles of character (PC) and Situation (run by the GM but effectively co-created) discussing what they want out of the game. What's fun. What's not fun. Where it should go (in general).<br/><br/>This will <i>result</i> in plausibility. It isn't the primary driver (i.e. the GM says "You will be super-spies going into China to steal cloning technology." A player says "That's dull, but--hey, plausible. I'll be James Bond."--this would not be the likely output of the process since it'll stop at "that's dull.").<br/><br/>Secondly, I'm bothered in Sorcerer games when they lack consistency (not really a problem--but, eh, it happened). If DitV produced inconsistent situations regularly I'd be bothered with that too. I like the games. Am I another Sim-Guy or is consistency common across all your modes? (trick question: I am a Sim-Guy* and consistency is valued across all modes).<br/><br/>Here's my advice:<br/>1. IMO, casting things in GNS terms is going to screw it up for you if you want "fun Sim." I don't think it's geared that way. It can, you know, work for "people who like that sort of thing"--but that sort of thing is never anything good (like "I'm going to Sim being an elf ... so I sat around all day imagining I was, like, an elf--wasn't fun--I must not be Sim"). I'd do my best to drop that mode of thinking about the game and the system (and, hey, you can feel good--Hero has never been <i>classified</i>--it could still be kinda Nar!)<br/><br/>2. The term Plot is toxic. Either get rid of it in your thinking or "take it back" from the GNS-analysis that has likened it to railroading (of some degree). The essay linked to talks about Situation (and I, personally, use the word Plot and Situation interchangeably as in "Here's the plot for my kicker"). Get rid of it. If you are working on a Hero game, come up with 'Situation.'<br/><br/>Don't believe either, for a minute, that players are not empowered by the system to create situation themselves. That's what the essay is about. The players can suggest the situation-foundation in Hero, JAGS, or GURPS. That's immediate creation of situation right there. They define adversaries (enemies) and focuses of conflict (DNPCs). They don't have the power to define large-scale situational elements during play (i.e. determine "who dunnit") but they don't in DitV either. I think that's a red herring.<br/><br/>3. I suspect that anyone who is "stymied" by a "bang" has some problems going on. Maybe they don't have a real good grasp on the language you're playing in (presumably English)--or only do things when they think GM (or alpha-participant) wants them too--something <i>severe</i> like that.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I've been stymied by situational changes that seemed random or uninteresting or hard to get a handle on for some reason. I've seen stuff happen in the game that looked like the GM wasn't on top of their game and was floundering. I've had trouble figuring out how to *help* in situations like that.<br/><br/>See, when you make players 'those guys' (who are, you know, Sim-players) and game events 'bangs' (which, in your mind, are Narrativist) you put things into a GNS box that's, IMO, more or less <i>supposed</i> to result in failure. And amazingly, you get it. I doubt the players are stupified by the idea of "an in-game choice with no preordained outcome." I suspect they were frustrated by *something* else that was going on and not the pure "bang-ish" nature of the event. After all, how could they be: absent railroading, most any roleplaying game will be composed of these (the theme-focus is a possible point of interest here--but, again, if you just made a theme up without an relevance to an ongoing situation that's not necessarily functional narrativism either).<br/><br/>Basically I would suggest the following things:<br/>1. work your preferences into the pre-game zone. Talk about them before play starts. If you have stuff you want to introduce, do it with disads and <i>tell the GM</i> how you want it introduced ("Here is my DNPC--she is my partner and she's been captured by the Triad's Kung Fu master who wants to marry her. Worse, she's kinda attracted to him--but he has this bad idea that if he defeats <i>me</i>, he'll win her heart--").<br/><br/>2. Stop thinking of people as Sim-Guy (unless it is how you think of yourself). Don't think in terms of Plot (unless you can use it to mean situation--in which case Sorcerer Kickers have a plot--and I think they do. So do DitV towns.).<br/><br/>3. Break your play down into basic techniques: As the GM, how will you provide adversity? How will you maintain consistency? Is the action congruent with what you think the Players want? Is it congruent with the characters? Are the characters "fit" for whatever action you have decided on. Are the characters provided with real and important choices? Do the players care?<br/><br/>These are all techniques that can apply to ANY GNS mode--so get rid of modal thinking. <br/><br/>These are all techniques that are supported <i>beautifully</i> by traditional play--so get rid of "revolutionary vs. traditional" thinking.<br/><br/>Basically: think outside the (three) boxes.<br/><br/>-Marco<br/>* I'm willing to be a Sim-Guy. Someone has to be. I think the methodology is extremely clunky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66829/#Comment_66829" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T16:52:15+00:00" title="May  3, 2007  4:52PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite>2.

He missed the first session, so I had to figure out a way to get him into the mix for the second. I offered him the chance to tell me how his PC would appear, to which he responded, "You tell me. Whatever you want."<br/><br/>That's what I find weird. These players will happily go off on tangents during the game, but seem to be dumbfounded when I actively offer them a chance to take control.

Getting everyone on the same page can be a chore but it's my experience that you can sort of ease into it.
