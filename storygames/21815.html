To me, the algorithm manages to exacerbate noise even when a community doesn\u2019t have a massive amount of users. Since active topics don\u2019t bubble up to the top, they quickly sink under all kinds of stuff unless they have large amount of likes/+1\u2019s. You\u2019d think that the popularity algorithm would help the cream bubble up to the top, but my experience is that far too many content-less posts are extremely popular (like the equivalents of food porn or cat posts). That discourages continued attention and focus on an actual discussion topic. <br/><br/>Categories should help in theory, but I\u2019m not sure how many users bothered to check various categories. It would have helped if I could set some categories like off-topic to not show on the main stream of the community. <br/><br/>I\u2019m not really that sad to see it go, except for the fact that a lot of content will be lost. And towards the tail end, some designers that I respect had actually joined, even if they weren't posting, so at least solo rp was in their radar in some shape, so that's a loss (but maybe it already served its purpose in getting them to check things out). <br/><br/>As an aside, I\u2019m seeing people flock to MeWe, and that is unfortunate imo. As far as I can tell, the community tools are even more useless. I\u2019m encouraged, however, that a lot of people from the old solo community have decided to join either <a href="https://goo.gl/rbcS2L" rel="nofollow">Reddit </a>or <a href="https://goo.gl/4BS6Y6" rel="nofollow">Google Groups</a>. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476924/#Comment_476924" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-10T18:47:30+00:00" title="October 10, 2018  6:47PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            G+ groups were superhelpful to me -- but I'm talking about very narrowly focused groups, such as the Dracula Dossier group and the Eternal Lies group.<br/><br/>Groups for Monsterhearts or Urban Shadows were also useful.

After mostly lurking to see what you (Matthijs) were posting during your FB timeouts 2011-2013, my activity and # of contacts exploded 2014-2017. Epidiah\u2019s \u201cget to know each other" posts were central to that.<br/><br/>I gained a handful of what I would call real friends, or at least internet pals I was on very good terms with. Somewhere around 2015-16, I really felt like part of an online community (yes, I read Corley\u2019s post <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ) <br/><br/>I was interviewed, I interviewed others, I exchanged ideas, wrote more blog posts and short games, was inspired. I made Old Friends with Jason M, and the Itras By: The Menagerie anthology with a crew I met on G+ for a large part.<br/><br/>I don\u2019t think any of that would have happened if it wasn\u2019t for this scene/community/medium/loose network. <br/>I think I got better at Englishing, too.<br/><br/>Negatively, I felt I constantly had to tip-toe around other people\u2019s conflicts, politics and cultural/language rules that seemed to change on a weekly basis. <br/><br/>My general social media fatigue after moderating the (by Norwegian standards) large Rollespill.info forum spilled over to G+ and the interactions with more and (far) less prickly strangers.<br/><br/>It also consumed a lot of time I could have spent on other stuff.<br/><br/>The previous three paragraphs are the reasons I quit last year(?).

Also, I got introduced to The Clay That Woke by someone posting on Google+, and for that I will be eternally grateful. Mostly I used it for Fate and for keeping up with a few gaming buddies I see maybe once a year at a local con.<br/><br/>I'm not a big social media user. It's hard for me to learn how to use new systems; I just don't get them. Perhaps I am getting old. This means there's a big hurdle for me to find a new community.<br/><br/>I might be talking and thinking about games a little less now, unless I can find a similar community. The people I talk to on Google+ seem to be fragmenting into two camps: "I'm going to MeWe" and "I won't go to MeWe because it's a haven for the alt-right so I'm going to one of a dozen other platforms."                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477115/#Comment_477115" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-18T06:11:13+00:00" title="October 18, 2018  6:11AM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's funny.

I participated for a while, but then just finding the types of discussions I was looking for took effort - sorting through lots of chaff. I was active for a couple years and then stopped being, and then stopped really knowing or caring what was going on in rpg design.<br/><br/>G+ was very exciting for a minute, but I quickly grew to dislike it and stopped using it. I'm glad people are here again. I don't think social media is a good platform for discussion. Forums have their own problems, but they might be the best platform we have for actually being humans together on the internet and jointly having conversations that matter to us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
