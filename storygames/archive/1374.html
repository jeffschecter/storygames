                    Based on several recent threads, I have this image in my head for a mechanic that I can't quite bring to life.<br/><br/>The basic principle is this - the whole mechanic is based on a deck of cards.  Or rather all the mechanics - char gen, resolution, possibly even plotting.  All based on the same set of cards and the same continuous process. The idea would be that a group could sit down and with some brief conversation set-up a game and start playing without needing to spend time in char gen or reference book reading.  I suppose optimally, the core rules would fit on a card the same size as the cards used in play.<br/><br/>I imagine players starting out with a general agreement of setting - 1920's pulp adventure or deep space star opera, something - and some very iconic description of thier character - geeky college kid, scrappy journalist, two-fisted statistician, or whatever.  (The setting might be keyed to the game/deck, though at the moment I really want to stay way from the idea of a different deck per setting or adventure or such.)<br/><br/>Everyone is then dealt some number of cards from the custom deck of cards.  Play then proceeds more or less like a standard card game - draw one, play one - that sort of thing.  By playing a card you: (1) set or advance the scene, (2) solidify some aspect of your character, or (3) initiate or respond to some sort of conflict.  At the end of each hand, the scene closes, the conflict resolves, you make a record of the new permanent aspect(s) of your character.  Wash-rinse-repeat.<br/><br/>I pulled out my Marvel SAGA cards last night thinking they might fill the bill, but the largely help with (1) and (3) to some extent, but other than personality traits don't really address (2). <br/><br/>It strikes me that the cards may need to be pretty information dense to do everything I've described.  <br/><br/>That's really as far as I've gotten. Which is why I'm putting this in Little Ideas. Does this stir up any ideas in others?  Am I recreating a wheel here?  Any thoughts on how to proceed?                </div>

                            Definitely a similar mental space.  One of the key differences I see is that I don't want to separate the char gen phase from the play phase.  <br/><br/>But the idea of "I remember when...." to add a 'trait' (for lack of a better term at the moment) to a character fit well within my mental framework.                        </div>

                            Yes, in my case the separation is important, because in the chargen phase the character is primarily defined by the other players; once the situation-based play begins, the character can move to being defined by the player.<br/><br/>It's a metaphor for growing up; for going from being defined by parents, school, job, spouse, children -- to being self-made.                        </div>

                            I'm kind of working on an idea along the same lines.<br/><br/>I don't know how to work everything out yet, but this is what I've brain stormed so far (it's pretty obvious which threads I've been reading lately).  This isn't well organized yet in my head.<br/><br/>My goals are to have a game with a small social footprint, can be played in an evening, and can be played with the number of players available (so no GM if the GM doesn't show up).<br/><br/>1) Character creation<br/>Each character has a one sentence character concept type thing on the top of an index card.  Then you take a deck of cards and deal them out face down to each player.<br/><br/>2) Development<br/>Each player takes turns creating a sub-goal for that character (and writing it down underneath the goal like key chains).  They then declare a sub personality train or part of his profession used in this scene to achieve this sub-goal.  Then the other players (or just the player across from him?) creates and narrates opposition to this sub-goal.  The first play decides on a number of cards (must be less than or equal to five) and flips them over one at a time.  Red cards mean that things go well for the character, black cards mean that they go poorly.  Players narrate after each card.  The number of cards used is written next to the sub-trait used.  The last card flipped is the outcome of the sub goal and who has final narration.<br/><br/>Play proceeds to the player with the largest number of cards.  After the first round you must always play enough cards so you aren't the player with the most cards.<br/><br/>Players can decide that their character is in opposition this scene and then the players bid cards.  The one with the most cards gets to choose the sub-trait.  The other player must then write either the same or an opposite sub-trait down (but only discards the number of cards bid).<br/><br/>3) Climax<br/>After all of the cards have been played, then the cards are reshuffled and the climax happens.  Using the story so far, the other players decide on the final opposition for the character's goal.  Where in the development stage players were rewarded for creating traits, this stage they are rewarded for integrating traits used in the above story.  Still working out the exact system for this stage, but like a movie, all climatic action will happen at once.<br/><br/>4) Denouement<br/>Each player gets to look at the character concept and make any changes needed at this time to the character and then describe a short scene describing the changed character.  Can be skipped if nothing really changes.<br/><br/>5) Re-play<br/>Characters can be saved to be played again at another date.  Sub traits can be re-introduced in future stories, but are only worth how much the player pays for them.<br/><br/>Like I said, <b>very</b> rough draft.                        </div>
