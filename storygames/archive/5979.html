Say characters are made with points instead of level - stats and talents both give points.  So the GM might be up against four 20-point heroes.  So there's 80 points arrayed against the GM.<br/><br/>By default, the GM puts up 80 points of opposition in his scenario, which he can spend on monsters, mooks, enemy NPCs, and dangers.  At the end, only opposition that actually came into a scene (even if it was avoided) counts.<br/><br/>Anything less than 40 points is too easy to deal with, so when the PCs defeat all opposition... they get 40 points to spend on rewards.<br/><br/>I want the players to be able to say "hey, I want X points of opposition" and up it from 40 to X.  Bigger threat, bigger reward.  <br/><br/>So imagine I can figure out how to price opposition properly (some points for monster abilities, extra points if they have a good chance to surprise the party, etc.)<br/><br/>The problem for me is figuring out how to price rewards.  I don't want each reward to be a trinket for better adventuring - I want some of the rewards to be other things the PCs want.  But there's this seems really weird to me.  Why does taking apart the 100-point dungeon give you more ability to ensure that Mr. Gabban who put the party up for a night doesn't lose the family farm, compared to the 50 point dungeon?  Are you just dropping treasure on everything?  Is that what gets the princess to marry you too? <br/><br/>Am I trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133601/#Comment_133601" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T14:16:41+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  2:16PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't quite figure out the question...if the player is already saying 'I want to risk more', aren't they already balancing the rewards they can expect against that?<br/><br/>Maybe there's an order-of-action thing I'm missing here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133627/#Comment_133627" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T18:43:21+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  6:43PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But there's this seems really weird to me.

Whatever it is, let the other one suffer (eg, if you decide its about whether they would risk their lives, then that means letting plausbile causality suffer).<br/><br/>If your trying to get both perfect - well, you might love having both in a game, but hell, your not actually writing any game while your trying to get both. Let go of perfection and just go for one thing - you can always try for perfection after your first games written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133630/#Comment_133630" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T19:04:45+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  7:04PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan - Good point.

Mostly I say that because I don't think a "rate of exchange" between the two that applies consistently across players is feasible.<br/><br/>They cross over if the saved farm translates into a reduction in living expenses due to free bread and cheese or a +2 bonus on information gathering from friendly NPC's etc.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133676/#Comment_133676" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T06:58:58+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  6:58AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2008 7:01AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's simple (and Rob is hinting at it). Whatever level of difficulty the players take on, they save the farm. The question of reward is not whether or not they save the farm, or how big the farm is, or whatever, but how thankful farmer Gabban is when you win. You get a relationship with Gabban, which you might leverage to marry his daughter, perhaps. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing you're missing is the value of relationships. Also personality traits. Perhaps somebody is fighting to face his fears. If he wins his new bravery trait will be based on how big a challenge he faced. <br/>\n<br/>\nRelationships and personality traits. Make them mechanical, and the math all works out.

I think it's quite possible to, and even preferable to, have a system that outputs both -- however, outputting them interchangeably (stick or distillery?) leads to problems.  You're essentially making players choose between a cool story and a cool character, and choosing either sucks if it means not choosing the other -- especially when it's pretty easy to rig the system to make both happen every time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
