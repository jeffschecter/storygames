It's a combination of Jason Morningstar's "Dungeon Squad" with Clinton Nixon's "Donjon", and a few other elements stolen from various places. It's great for creating pulp fantasy short stories, in the vein of Howard, Leiber, and especially Moorcock.  You can play a full session, including character creation, and with no prep, inside two hours.<br/><br/>Since I published the game, I've had heaps of great feedback on it. Which parts work, which parts don't, what's easy to understand and what isn't. I've compiled all that playtest feedback into a new "1.2" edition of the game. The system is largely unchanged, but I've clarified a lot of rules, refined the expression of some others, and added more advice on how to make the game fun in play.<br/><br/>You can download a pdf of the game <a href="http://simoncarryer.googlepages.com/OnMightyThews.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>, or view it online <a href="http://simoncarryer.googlepages.com/home" rel="nofollow">here.</a>  As always, the game is completely free!<br/><br/>One thing I've discovered since writing the game is that it's far better suited for Moorcockian weird fantasy than Howardesque sword-and-sorcerey.  It does Howard well, and that's what I played with it for the first six months after I wrote it, but recent play has taken a far more Moorcockian bent, and the game has really come into its own.  The player narration rights lend themselves to weirdness and the bizzarre, but grounded enough that the game doesn't spiral off into gonzo-land.  The character trait mechanics also really encourage brooding antiheroes and mysterious adventurers.<br/><br/>Hopefull this will distract a few of you away from Danger Patrol mania.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218308/#Comment_218308" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T13:41:23+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  1:41PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've saved off the PDF and will read it when I have time.

Plus you're limited to describing the results of the conflicts - any new facts you include need to be a natural consequence of the conflict - things your character could discover, cause, or encounter as a result of the conflict.  That naturally limits the scope of how weird things can get.<br/><br/>Also, the traits, being reasonably specific, tend to encourage people to create conflicts in the realm of adventuring (running, jumping, climbing, and also dealing with exotic cultures), Fighting, or Sorcery (which if you're not a sorcerer, is mostly book learning, and if you are a Sorcerer, is very specificly defined).  That keeps things grounded in the genre fairly well.<br/><br/>That said, as with any game, the greatest arbiter of tone is the group's preference.  In On Mighty Thews, the GM has a good deal of scope to limit the stakes of a conflict to things that feel genre-appropriate.  As with most player-empowered games, the game you get is going to be a product of a combination of everyone's desires.  The game can't stop you from going gonzo if that's where some players want to take it, but I've tried to avoid the positive feedback loop of escalating action and weirdness that I've experienced in some games.<br/><br/>Of course, it still might not be what you're after, but cheers for giving it a read anyhow.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Simon                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227259/#Comment_227259" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T13:07:30+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  1:07PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/><br/>Hey, I gave this a read, and it's pretty cool! I'd like to play it sometime, at least once in a silly mode and at least once in a serious mode.<br/><br/>I do have some criticism. But it's because I like it!<br/><br/>1. You suggest that the game be used for sword &amp; sorcery and weird fantasy, but several of your examples that pertain to <i>dungeoncrawl</i> fantasy. You talk about doors &amp; corridors, and getting treasure before someone else, a few times. I understand that your mechanics are drawn from dungeony games, and I know that these things can be <i>present</i> in S&amp;S and WF, but I think you'd do well for the examples to center more on what the nature of the conflicts of such fiction tend to be like. I suggest grabbing some Howard and/or Leiber stories, picking neat scenes from 'em, and drawing your examples directly from those scenes, with the serial numbers filed off. For instance, tell us how, using this game, we'd handle the scene with Conan and the vampire chick in Cush from <i>Hour of the Dragon</i>. From there, we'd be able to extrapolate things about doors and treasure just fine.<br/><br/>2. Go into some more detail regarding how to make a map and use it at the start of play. The biggest problem I've observed in roleplaying is that groups tend to gloss over Situation, or even that they don't <i>understand</i> how to create a grabby, relevant Situation. For a lot of us indie folk, after exposure to things like Town Creation in DitV and Kickers &amp; Relationship Maps in <i>Sorcerer</i>, this stuff is second nature, but not so for a lot of people. And <i>we</i> even screw it up sometimes! 90% of failed Dogs or Sorcerer games is because people didn't pay enough attention to the Situation mechanics.<br/><br/>The obvious trick in OMT is take whatever's going on at the cool place we point to on the map, and index that with the PCs' D20 traits. That's obvious <i>to me</i>, and I'm willing to bet that it's obvious to you. But it ain't so obvious to some other people.<br/><br/><br/>On a more gushy note: the "enough money for..." rule is fantastic. Truly awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227305/#Comment_227305" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T14:14:24+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  2:14PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Simon, I copied the game from your website and pasted it into a super-simple layout for screen reading and printing as a booklet, which you can find <a href="http://kallistipress.com/downloads/On%20Mighty%20Thews.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

I tend to use "dungeony" examples because they're familiar, and to my mind they're easy to understand.  But you're right, in this context they're probably misleading.<br/><br/>The map thing is a relatively recent addition to the game, so I'm still figuring out exactly how it works.  Feedback from players has been good though.  Referencing d20 traits in creating your situation is probably a very good idea.  Sometimes the d20 traits won't work for that super well, but sometimes they will.  It's sword and sorcery, so it's not really about the protagonists confronting their issues and changing, so much as the protagonists' traits being a catalyst for change and action.  <br/><br/>Josh,<br/><br/>That document looks awesome!

On the other hand, because it's free I can constantly improve it without pissing off people who bought the 1.2 edition just before 1.5 came out.  <br/><br/>I'm pretty confident that the way the mechanics work right now makes the protagonists' traits central to the game, and makes them agents for change.
