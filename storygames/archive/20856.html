I don't really want to sell them being that I don't think I could recoup enough to make it worth it. I'm interested in giving the games away to a girl or boy who wants to get into the hobby; a girl would be really cool! Ideally, this would be someone who wouldn't have the means to purchase the RPG books that I would gift them. I would like to do this without being intrusive in any way; basically, just giving the game to their parents or mailing it to them. Has anyone done this and how did they go about it? Is their a way to know the right person is getting it and someone isn't just taking advantage of the situation?

Put the parcel on a side table, and point it out to your co-gamers as they come in, in case they know of a good destination. It is likely that some of them have appropriate young relatives who would enjoy the books. Give the parcel to whoever indicates such, and let them take the books the rest of the way. If you have lots of books, just bring them out in several parcels over time, no need to burden a single recipient with a massive pile.<br/><br/>(I personally wouldn't worry about somebody taking advantage of you in this scenario: presumably the people you game with aren't scummy enough to lie to your face about what they intend to do with your books. I could see that scenario in an open online call for recipients, but not in this sort of face-to-face situation.)<br/><br/>A lateral idea that might work for your purposes: gift the books to a library. That way many children get to use them, and arguably they will be better utilized, as it is likelier that somebody who really appreciates the given game will find it. Obviously you'll want to make sure that the library has space for the books on their shelves so they don't end up in storage. (Also, I hear that some American libraries maybe don't stock rpgs because they originate in Satan worship or something, but I'm sure you'd know about that better than me. Finnish libraries love to have rpgs, historically they've collectively been my biggest customer.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457861/#Comment_457861" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-05T13:08:26+00:00" title="November  5, 2016  1:08PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With American libraries, you really need to talk to people in person.
