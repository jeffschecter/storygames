It was notable for two things (1) the way that a detailed vision presented both problems and strengths, and (2) the fact that someone actually Ascended, which is the first time a character has ascended during a con game so far.<br/><br/>If you want to read an actual game summary there <a href="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/cms.pope" rel="nofollow">is one on my website</a>.<br/><br/>So for point one. One of the characters (Rachael) had a very detailed Vision, more detailed than I usually recommend (it certainly didn't fit in the box on the character sheet). That Vision detailed Rachael's desire to be a Jerry Cornelius style robot assassin locked in battle with the Solar-Powered Pope, who ruled the world from his flying Cathedral, and wore whole worlds (and/or galaxies) as rings on his fingers. (There was more ... I'm paraphrasing). What I found interesting was that this wasn't *really* her Vision, it was an example of a valid Vision. What she really wanted was to be a pulp/SF/cthulhu-punk heroine fighting evil. The detailed Vision was one possible realization of that idea, but not the only one. Nevertheless we went with it.<br/><br/>So during play that Vision was very interesting. It was a good source of thematic elements for the story. It was rich with details that could be stolen and used, and lots of them came up in the game. At the same time I felt it was limiting the player (hopefully he might stop by and say whether he felt that too) by overly-restricting his engagement with the story as it was happening. All his interactions with the story seemed to concern elements directly from the vision, almost by name. Did that reduce his fun? I'm not so sure about that.<br/><br/>Point two ... someone Ascended! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> This is the first time this has happened in a Con game. Usually people take the idea that their characters are trying hard *not* to Ascend seriously and hold back, but not this time. It's possible that I should have worked in a Limitation scene or two for him (though time was very short), so that he would have a chance to raise some Limitations and, more importantly, be reminded of what he was staying in this world for, but it was great fun to see the character seize his destiny and vanish into his perfect world.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193886/#Comment_193886" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-24T09:21:47+00:00" title="February 24, 2009  9:21AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds cool.
