It could be a really interesting thread except that I've never heard of a lot of these games. I <em>want</em> to find out about a lot of these games, and there's a good chance I want to <em>purchase</em> a lot of these games. But that is made hard because there are like two links in the list of dozens of games.</p>\n<p><strong>IF YOU DON'T LINK TO GAMES THEN PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.</strong></p>\n<p>Just dropping the names of games and walking away is unhelpful to you, the thread, and the creators of the games.</p>\n<p>The "creators" bit is important. Independent game creators rely on word-of-mouth enthusiasm to get people to get the goods. If you don't link to the game's page, that last part of the transaction doesn't happen, which means that game you like doesn't get sold to other people you might want to play with, which also means the creator doesn't get to move forward whatever their publishing objectives are and that endangers the future of the game.</p>\n<p>This is the thing about community. You're not just a customer. We don't advertise for the most part because we rely on earnest people-to-people linking. In the recent past, the indie community was small enough that everyone knew that and were basically linking to their friends' games. It's what made this whole thing fly. But now there are so many players who <em>don't</em> know the creators, they have some idea that the games are made by abstract people who are far away and inaccessible, and with whom their entire interaction is twenty bucks and a perfect bound book.</p>\n<p>That's not the whole interaction. The creator wants to help you have a great game. There might be non-obvious implications of the rules you discover and want to discuss with the creator. <em>You can</em>. Email the creator. They might have a forum. They might be here. Whatever. But the other part of that interaction is that <em>you</em> are supporting <em>them</em>. If you don't care about the game, then it doesn't matter. But if you want it to gain popularity so the creator will make another one you like, if you want to get more players for game night, if you think your friends would benefit by knowing about it, link whenever you discuss a game. Everyone will benefit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198243/#Comment_198243" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-22T11:27:05+00:00" title="March 22, 2009 11:27AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know, severly emphasizing the benefits of the community, in order to beg people to link games seems to undermine the whole point of <b>Earnest Word of Mouth </b> Advertising.

It's how Wikipedia works, after all. And I'm not suggesting proscribing anyone's actions. What am I, vengeful Santa? I'm suggesting that, if you want people to know about this thing you think is cool, you link to the thing.</p>\n<p>People link when they're enthusiastic because they want to give credit for something they think is cool and tell other people about it. Posting in that thread back there is basically burying the names of games so no one will be able to learn more. Combined with the near total lack of description, that thread is almost totally devoid of information. We don't even know which ones the players think are worthy of note, just which ones might, irrespective of the degree of introspection of the poster, fit the criterion of the OP.</p>\n<p>Wolfe,</p>\n<p>How can I know if I might be interested? A link gives me something to think about. A name does not. I'm not going to google 50 games in case one of them might be interesting.</p>\n<p>Here's the deal: if you want to say, "This is an obscure thing that I think is cool," I want to see evidence of that because I love cool things. Evidence is likely in the description of the thing by the creator and in examples of play.</p>\n<p>I generally operate on the assumption that, if someone links to a game, and in particular AP, it's because they think it's worth linking to and that is interesting to me. If they don't, well, the Internet is full of things to look at. If they write something themselves that appeals to my tastes, even better: that gives me even more context.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The answer to that question will differ based on the purposes of the thread, so it's hard to give it to you. I'll give 'er a shot, though. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, the thread starts out with a generalized survey. "What games do this?" Many of the answers will be games that people are generally familiar with. Links and details aren't always needed. Just naming the game may be enough for the purposes of the thread, as the author goes "Oh yeah, that game does do that" or "It does? Now that I think about it, I guess I can see that." Other times, more information will be needed, and that's when the asking comes in. Sometimes it's a general request ("hey guys, can you tell me why/how you think this game is applicable to this question?") or more specific ("I've never heard of that game. Tell me more.")<br/>\n<br/>\nGiving context isn't rude, no. I never suggested it was, though. Making a blatant and obvious attempt to sell a game is a different beast though. Dropping a mention of a game in every thread that you can squeeze it into, along with a link and a gushing endorsement is what I'm talking about. There's a continuum between that and simply giving context. Most people, I think, tend to err on the side of caution. They'll give context as a rule (unless the thread sounds like a survey) but they may not link. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my observation. If it turns out that no one thinks dropping a link with every mention of a game is pushing the envelope of overt selling, then maybe I'll start doing that. I can't speak for anyone else, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think Jason is specifically addressing the title of this thread, rather than the content. In that context, it's pretty funny. If I *was* the sole avenue of promotion, that'd be pretty sad. No one likes me enough to take my recommendations seriously, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198318/#Comment_198318" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T04:46:05+00:00" title="March 23, 2009  4:46AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>If it turns out that no one thinks dropping a link with every mention of a game is pushing the envelope of overt selling, then maybe I'll start doing that.</blockquote>\nDepends. Are you linking to <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/home.php" rel="nofollow">IPR</a>, <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/" rel="nofollow">RPGNow</a>, or somesuch?

Unless the target page is ad-driven, I'm just as likely to link to a resource for a product I dislike as I am for one I like. It's less about supporting the game or the author and more about being inclusive in your writing.<br/><br/>Joshua seems to be talking about more than that, though. He's specifically mentioning a perceived decline in community-driven support around indie games, presumably both from authors towards their audience as well as the audience making assumptions about the accessibility of the authors.

I never considered these two phenomena connected in any way. My own opinion is that the rampant consumerism and brand-loyalty many gamers exhibit is damaging to the hobby and needs to be stomped out with extreme prejudice. The only way I know how to do that, in gaming or otherwise, is to support independent "artists" of merit - artists who are more concerned with producing good games and helping people play them than build brand loyalty or appeal to consumer impulses and lifestyles.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>I think that if no new RPGs were produced for a hundred years then this would in no way affect my gaming in the least.</blockquote>\nI'd hazard to say that if this were true, it would only be because you are completely uninterested in the progression of RPGs, likely due to being fully satisfied with the games already on your shelf. If that is the case, I'd suggest that you are not the target audience for this thread, as you would be unlikely to purchase any new RPG products regardless of the degree of linkage to them. Not saying that to shut you down or insult you - I'm happy you have managed to find gaming bliss - just to mention that if you don't care about future RPG developments, the whole notion of supporting artists so they can produce will be lost on you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198324/#Comment_198324" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T07:15:33+00:00" title="March 23, 2009  7:15AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm happy to support games.  If a game is the kind of thing you like then buy it by all means.  If an author or a game then brings out stuff you don't like then don't support them in that decision by buying it.  I can see how encouragement would work in those conditions.  You're voting with your wallet.  <br/><br/>By contrast, buying everything someone puts out regardless of whether you like what they do or not is a completely inefficient way of sending consumer feedback.  Giving someone money on the off-chance that they might then produce something brilliant in the future is irrational.  It's like prayer.  Hell, if you believe in that I'll give you my paypal address and you can keep sending me money.  I haven't ever written a game and have no real interest in doing so but the chances that I will a) start producing games and b) produce the greatest game ever would be massively increased if people started just giving me money.<br/><br/>Support individual products.  Not people.<br/><br/><br/>As for the second part, it;s not true that I have no interest in the development of game design.  It's just that my interests and preferences are so out of synch with the gaming community as a whole that on a game by game basis, it's mostly the case that RPG publishing has nothing to offer me.  There are the odd exceptions, I picked up Hot War for example, but there's no guarantee that any new games would be better than what I currently have access to.  I think that this is the same position everyone finds themselves in.  Game design is not heading towards some kind of omega point of awesomeness.  The difference between me and most people is that I have realised that my gaming most likely isn't going to be massively improved by a new game.  Most gamers still have faith in this possibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198331/#Comment_198331" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T08:23:26+00:00" title="March 23, 2009  8:23AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm more likely to click on a link out of curiosity than to google a game and then wade through the masses of free mmos with the same name.

I'm not a salesman.  I don't care if anyone, anywhere, ever buys anything.  I'm not under any kind of obligation to the writer, to the publisher, or even to the retailer to try and promote a game.

Supporting the author can give the author the means and incentive to continue producing his or her products, which benefits the community as a whole.<br/><br/>Now, granted, you may have no more room on your RPG shelf, and feel that you have no need for new games.  And perhaps it's impossible to appeal to the altruistic side of your nature, asking that you promote games for the sake of the players who are still interested in the production of new games.  Yet even the egoistic and insular gamer (and here I am invoking an exemplary extremity, not leveling a judgmental accusation) can appreciate that maybe there is a game that has yet to be published that actually would be a worthy addition to the collection and change something his or her gaming.  If the designer of your favorite game had jammed his hands in his pockets and slouched off into the gathering dusk, scowling and kicking an empty soup can, seeking fortune elsewhere <i>before</i> penning that magnum opus you play every Saturday afternoon, you'd really be missing out.  So linking can be a tiny investment in the grand possibilities of the future!<br/>Because, hey, you never know.  So the minuscule effort of supporting designers, even just by linking to their games, seems worth the great dividends it <i>could</i> provide.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198362/#Comment_198362" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T11:22:46+00:00" title="March 23, 2009 11:22AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Eison</cite>I think the indie gaming consumer should be motivated not by a sense of duty, but by a desire to make the creation of games a more fulfilling (and profitable) venture for the designers.

Finding the means and incentive to continue producing products is a problem and a responsibility for the author, I think, not for the consumers.  The consumer's only required role here is to buy the things he or she likes; the consumer should not be expected to be an advocate on the creator's behalf, nor to be an evangelist for "the community," nor even to be an informational resource for other consumers curious about the product.<br/><br/>If you <i>want</i> to do any of those things, that's fine.  Follow your bliss, as my hippie ex-roommate liked to say.  You can absolutely choose to be an advocate, an evangelist, a resource, a forward-thinking idealist investing in a designer who might write the best game ever ten years from now, and any other little thing your heart desires...but that is an entirely separate deal from being a consumer, and thinking otherwise can lead to heartbreak for creators, consumers, and fans alike.  In other words, choosing to provide that kind of support is a gift, not an obligation.<br/><br/>And don't get me wrong, it's a lovely gift.  I get warm fuzzies seeing people do stuff like that even in situations where I have absolutely no stake in the matter as either a consumer or a creator.  It's usually very cool to see people who genuinely love a product expressing that love and encouraging others to share in it.  I just don't believe that anyone who buys a product should be expected to give that gift.  Nobody's owed anything, so tactics like "don't you want to support the gaming community?" and "don't you realize that the author needs your help to market his product?" seem really out of place in this instance.<br/><br/><br/>Besides, I've always found that the few times I wanted a link to a product being discussed here, I could just post "hey, do you have a link for that?" and quickly receive one with no fuss.

I'm disagreeing with you but you dont know the motivations and I certainly don't need more pop psycology telling me that i'm a lazy worthless sack of shit for not agreeing with you. <br/><br/>So let me refute a few other points that amuse me. <br/><br/><b>1) It's frakkin' easy! </b>- Its easier not to, invalid point<br/><b>2) People will like you</b> - I have already said that I don't suscribe to your political view and these posts make it pretty clear that im not interested in signing up to your political view, becoming popular or singing koombiyah with the indie darling community. <br/><b>3) More people will own/play the game you like to play</b> - Will they? There has been precious little evidence that links actual translate into sales, and even if they did. Chances are they won't be by anyone I know, because I don't know anyone on the internet (for varifaction purposes I know someone when i can walk uninvited into their houses, and they just say "hey logos, wazzup" as apposed to the myriad of other responces I would expect form total strangers like you all ). Furthermore if we want some more anecdotyle evidence, I found sea dracula with only a name and no link. I found Kills Puppies for Satan with little, (I beleieve I had the phrase, Lumpley Games" . People are quite able to find things on their own, because otherwise, we all wouldn't have made it here to this point were everyone should advertise for everyone else in order to be a good indie game citizen. <br/><b>1) You can't be bothered to link</b> <i>(but you have the time to write 100 indignant words about why you aren't linking</i>) Yeah because I think its important to talk about different views on things. I don't think its important to follow 'good faith' rules on when and how to post links to original material, thus the talking i have been doing. Thanks for the snideness as well. I appreciate it, If I don't get my daily dose of snide I damn well break out. <br/><br/>For those of you silently screaming about how this is not poltical , or making snide little jokes, defacto dismissing complaints of proscription, all the while telling me how to talk about indie games for the love of god consider this quotey thing. <br/><i><br/>My own opinion is that the rampant consumerism and brand-loyalty many gamers exhibit is damaging to the hobby and needs to be stomped out with extreme prejudice. The only way I know how to do that, in gaming or otherwise, is to support independent "artists" of merit - artists who are more concerned with producing good games and helping people play them than build brand loyalty or appeal to consumer</i><br/><br/>I don't think that I took that too out of context, quite frankly. People are brands. Lumpley Games is a brand, Your telling me that I should buy stuff, because the artist has made other good stuff, and its important for artists to be supported by virtue of their status as independent or artist or meritful, rather than the virtue of the things they are trying to sell. Your promoting brand loyalty, while calling it 'damaging to the hobby'  Its based on the assumptions that the actual hobby, you know that one dominated by wotc, whitewolf and stuff, are somehow badwrongfun and the efforts they go to to spread the hobby (advertising) are 'damaging to the hobby'. Who knows maybe you are right, but it doesn't change the fact that this old song and dance is about as a protectionist, as a labour union singing the national anthem while protecting their jobs. Sorry for not signing up to the union. <br/><i><br/>I see it as fighting against internet empathy writ large. It's why blogs have links. It's why podcasts have show notes. It's why feeds exist.</i><br/><br/>Yes, because goddamnit, those internet people are doing it wrong, those poor apathetic internet users. <br/><b><br/>I think the indie gaming consumer should be motivated not by a sense of duty, but by a desire to make the creation of games a more fulfilling (and profitable) venture for the designers. Supporting the author can give the author the means and incentive to continue producing his or her products, which benefits the community as a whole.<br/></b><br/>Ah, so it doesn't benefit me to have an author continue making books, (which may or maynot be trash) rather it benefits the community, because having another successful author (who may or may not be rubbish) is more important than the books succeeding or failing based on their merits (which include their advertising). Quite Frankly, that seems to benefit the community of authors more than anything. Your making this a greater good argument when it is really an author good argument. <br/><br/><b>I'm more likely to click on a link out of curiosity than to google a game and then wade through the masses of free mmos with the same name. I'd appreciate links when possible. <br/></b><br/>Great, I think we all do, What I really appreciate as Honest and Earnest links, which are not what happens when you have a bunch of yahoos dropping links becuase 'thems there the manners of a indie darling' rather than linking to things they actually like. <br/><br/>Hey Andy , Can we get the name changed from Story Games: Tabletop Roleplaying to Story Games: Support us because otherwise there will be no story games?

I just figure it's a starting point for anyone with a certain level of interest between "I'll google that" and "I'll click that".  I don't have the URL memorized or anything, but knowing the company name allows me to google "blackgreengames" and get to the game's page in two clicks.  Copy URL.  Paste into post.
