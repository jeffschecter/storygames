                            I have a background in theater and took a graduate class devoted to storytelling that included a lot of theory, but also made us go to elementary schools and <em>tell stories</em>.  So a couple of initial thoughts..<br/><br/>We're <em>born</em> to tell and hear stories - in the mythopoetic sense.  I think it gets beaten out of us a little but never entirely.  It's amazing to watch kids just snap into the zone and eat up what you're saying like they are hungry for stories.<br/><br/>Telling a story to an audience is very physical and includes the stuff you'd expect, like posture and gesture but also intonation and how you take control of the space.  In my experience it is a little exhausting.                        </div>

<p>Storytelling is by no means a dead art; it is used to create a basis of belief and understanding - and instinctive awareness of a code of beliefs, in hundreds of thousands of rooms worldwide, every week.  Some of the storytellers are terrible, others are great; many use visual aids, others are highly expressive.  I'm not actually talking about gamers, here, though.  I'm talking about <em>Sunday School Teachers</em>.</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm going to think over this one step at a time.  I've never actually tried to teach anyone what I know and have done with this stuff, so this may be really, really muddled.</p>
<p>To begin, you must gain the attention of your audience.  You must hook them.  When you start to tell a story, you must first <em>sell</em> your audience.  They have to hear it in your tone, in your posture, in everything about you - what you are about to tell them is <em>fascinating</em>.  And the opening line contributes; the audience should, upon hearing that line, want to know what happens next.</p>

<p>Now, before I go anywhere, I'm going to connect that to gaming - it's not what you asked for, I know, but I can't resist using this example.</p>
<p>The players sit down to play Dogs; they're on their way to a town, and I open up with a conflict, straight out - they're fighting through a storm.  Stakes are, I tell them, if they win, they make it to town before the lynching.  They fail, they don't.</p>
<p>Lynching?  What lynching?  They are <em>in</em>.</p>
<p>EDIT: Okay, I'll stop there for now.  Is this of any use to you?</p>

<blockquote>Teach me how to tell a story</blockquote>
Um... how's this?<br/><br/>First you can think about it as a chain of stuff that happens. I was in the store, then I bought some tortillas, and then I went home.<br/><br/>But nobody wants to hear that kind of story. They want a story with conflict in it. So really why you'd be telling that story is more like, "Dude, I was gonna make tacos, but holy crap, I discovered I was out of tortillas."<br/><br/>Cool. So now you're all, "dude, so did you end up getting tortillas? What happened?"<br/><br/>So any story worth a tortilla gots to have a conflict. People with any sense about them already know this. They just might not know what to call it.<br/><br/>Even better stories have a series of things that happen that keep the conflict from easily resolving. "The nearest store was closing in 15 minutes, and I was also supposed to walk the dog." And you're all, well, crap, so did you get your wife to walk the dog so you could go to the store? And then there's probably red lights and stuff to keep the suspense building, and maybe some old dude in the parking lot who won't get out of the way to let you park.<br/><br/>And of course it all builds up to an exciting end, where I'm all, "dude, they were saying store closing in like two minutes, and there I am trying to find the goddamn aisle with the mexican food, and then I remembered that the tortillas are actually back by the cheese, refrigerated, and I'm almost knocking people over, and..."<br/><br/>Everybody knows how to tell a story like that, I think, except the one guy at the party you end up stuck in the kitchen with, who proceeds to describe the stain on his new pair of pants.                        </div>

                            The best stories (IMO) are a result of the protagonists following their ruling passions. That's because I enjoy stories where the protagonists are active instead of reactive. So it's not, "This happens to the protag from the outside, then this happens to her, then this," even when there's conflict involved. Instead, it's "She sets out to do x (driven by her ruling passion), and gets in a conflict over it; in the resulting new situation, she is driven to do y, which escalates the situation into a more conflictual one and raises the stakes; until finally, she does z, which resolves the overall issue and proves that her passion leads to that outcome (in this case).<br/>
<br/>
Say,  Veronica wants to find out what really happened to her murdered mother; that's her ruling passion, the force that drives her. So she tries to interrogate person A and has a conflict over getting the information. With the newfound info, she goes and breaks into her mother's huge corporate employer's record center, where a conflict will be whether she will be discovered after finding evidence against her mother's boss. Finally, she sets out to bait the boss by setting up a trap, and the conflict becomes about what it'll cost her to bring him down and how far she's willing to go.<br/>
<br/>
Compare this to Veronica whose mom was murdered. Her ruling passion is still to find the killer. But things are brought to her: a man comes to her and shares evidence. She waits around, and someone stalks her and she escapes. Then someone else approaches her and shares evidence. Then the killer thinks she has it figured out (maybe she has, but she's not acting on it) and tries to get her, too.<br/>
<br/>
There were conflicts in that second example, but I'm not going to root much for the protagonist. She's passive, reactive, not purposefully addressing the situation.<br/>
<br/>
That's my $.02.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, that's part of why many old-school games suck at creating good stories. They will tell you to present a plot to the players, to throw them into situations, to guide them from one clue to the other. They're reacting, not acting. (Not always, of course, but the basic GM advice is usually to simply "hook" the characters in some semi-logical way to give them an excuse to participate in the conflicts, instead of making them actively follow their own passions.)                        </div>

                            Damn. I wrote a follow-up post, and then my browser ate it. So here's a short version.<br/>
<br/>
As for techniques: see Kickers, R-Maps, Bangs. <br/>
<br/>
A Kicker gives an inciting incident, but then keeps on asking: What do you do now? Note that you don't keep writing new Kickers; that would lead you into passive territory in which the character simply always reacts. One Kicker, then the player needs to push it forward.<br/>
<br/>
The R-Map gives you the environment in which you always have choices to answer that question of what to do next. There are NPCs involved in the situation, they are interconnected, and if you want to get to one of them, you can do it directly or indirectly.<br/>
<br/>
Bangs are attempts to open up a venue of action for the character. Sometimes the player likes that venue and drives down it; other times they drive right by.<br/>
<br/>
That's how I understand it all, anyway.                        </div>

<ul>
<li>Care about what you are telling. Be interested in it, and communicate your interest strongly.</li>

<p>I can think of two things missed so far.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make the audience care about the characters in whatever way suits.  If the villian is evil, work to make the audience hate them.  If it's a comedy of errors, then everyone should be sympathetic.  And so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Pattern.  Most audiences wants there to be a cadence to the story as a whole.  The first son, the second son, the son-as-protagonist from folklore.  The story that frames a story that frames a story, as in the Arabian nights.  The actual form of pattern varies wildly, but an audience should be able to pick up on it without you showing it to them - if they can see the structure, and think ahead, predicting bits here and there, this can carry them through any required dry stuff; because they have a sense of the structure and where they're going with you...  ...and because they know where they're going with you, they <em>are</em> with you.</p></li>

The elements you include in your definition of story are, peculiarly enough, more akin to drama.  Of course, drama is a type of story, but if you want something more encompassing, a broader set of characteristics may be necessary.<br/>
<br/>
That's not to say I don't like drama or don't see its value.  It is, in fact, my chosen medium.  However, basing your understanding of story solely upon drama is like basing a definition of color only upon red.                        </div>

                            One of the first primary rules of storytelling: Know your audience. Period. If you don't know to whom your speaking a story will fall flat. Knowing your audience may mean knowing their culture (by being from it.) it may mean knowing their job (by being of the same profession.) and so on and so forth. But you know enough to tell the story to them, and asjust those basic, subtle elements that come from knowing who you are speaking too.                        </div>

<p>Back when I was a young boy, my father used to tell stories when we were on vacation, sitting by the campfire. He usually waited for us to be in the right mood, kind of relaxed, but not too tired to follow someone else speaking for a longer time.</p>
<p>His stories were often ones we already knew, like the classical greek sagas. We would look up into the sky, and he'd show us a constellation, tell how to find it, and then tell what the greeks thought how that particular constellation came to be in the sky, like Orion for example. The technique I would derive from this is to have something in the real world, find a pattern in it and then think of a story which explains why the pattern found has a place where it is found. It helps in telling the story because everybody involved knows <em>why</em> the story is told.</p>

OK.  That was a bit snippy, but I was trying to introduce the idea that oral storytelling is not always dramatic storytelling.  If you want to study varoius techniques of such, try going to other media that utilize oral storytelling.  Consider stand-up comedy (especially the older guys like Bill Cosby, Red Fox, and RIchard Pryor).  Consider the casual conversations between family and friends that recount particular experiences.  Consider folktales, especially those rooted in African and Native American tradition.  Although drama is one of the tools they use, it is not the only one available.  If you want a diverse set of tools at your disposal, I would suggest going to these kinds of sources and seeing what you find.  I'm sorry if this is not academic enough for you, but it's what I have.                        </div>

<p>How do you tell a story?  Well, I know of one way to answer that question...</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>One of the first primary rules of storytelling: Know your audience. <br/>
  Period. If you don't know to whom your[sic] speaking a story will fall flat.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This is one of the key elements of what the National Park Service (where I am a volunteer) calls <em>Interpretation</em>.  The formal study of this stuff is fairly recent, and largely comes after nearly a century of scratching heads about how certain Rangers did better than others.  One thing they realized quickly was that they didn't want either accomplished entertainers or lecturers.</p>
<p>So NPS Interpretation usually involves a park or other natural/historic resource, and an attempt to get the visitor to really <em>connect</em> with it.  So as I describe this, think of what it is that you want your audience or participants to connect to.  Is it the kingdom you created on the map laid over the table?  Is it the characters you had the players craft?  Is it the legendary artifact that your story focuses on?  Is it an NPC or Villain?</p>
<p>So here's my rundown of the "Interpretive Process Model" that the NPS hammers to death:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a tangible place, object, person, or event that you want the audience to care about.  You may have many, but should pick one to be iconic for your story.</li>
<li>Make a list or tree or other collection of intangible implications this resource has.  </li>
<li>Find Universal concepts in this set of intangibles.  Concepts such as death, freedom, god, safety, family, anger, and so forth all exist in some form in all cultures and across age groups.  These are your <em>guaranteed</em> hooks into any audience.</li>
<li>Identify your audience.  Often this advice is merely a bromide, and is easier said than done.  Largely this is all about using audience reactions to determine what story they <em>heard</em>, so that you can cater to them further.  </li>
<li>Write a single sentence of your story's theme, and this must include one Universal idea in its statement.  </li>
<li>From this, lay out the lay of the tale in your head.  As anchors, think of the associated emotional and intellectual connections you want your audience to make with the tangible object you chose in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>...and then step 7 is usually a stodgy way of saying "put it all together and just finish it."</p>
<p>If this all sounds painfully bureaucratic to begin with... Hell, it's the US federal government we're talking about here.  You'd be amazed at how many buzzwords I've sanded the edges off of.</p>
<p>There are of course other associated techniques that go into this model thingummy.  You have to balance the emotional connections and the intellectual connections: on Alcatraz we try not to get too technical about cell door mechanisms without also detailing how the prisoners felt when the doors slammed shut.  You also have to decide what your objectives for the tale are, although that's usually more for the lecture-ish side of things.</p>
<p>This sort of process is good for coming up with a 15-minute talk that keeps a crowd of all ages and varying English skills participating to the end.  If you know how to use those simple universal concepts as hooks, you can keep just about anyone from losing the plot.  The techniques also help compensate for varying levels of charisma or  oratorical linguistic skill in the speaker.</p>
<p>What you'll notice <em>isn't</em> in there is anything about dramatic structure, buildup, climax or denouement.  Part of this is because the park service does naturalist interpretations as well as historical, so the system was made general enough to cover both.  Part of it is just because that isn't the sort of thing that's worth formalizing to the point of forcing everyone to standardize.</p>
<p>But the rest, in my opinion, is all delivery and characterization and linguistic skill.  It's all embouchure and sense of pitch and tone and rhythm.  I don't know that you can really teach that stuff, although it can be learned.</p>

I can only point to sources I found particularly interesting and relevant to my experience.  I cannot do all the legwork, do a thorough analysis of my sources, then present my findings in a concise, coherent manner.  I am not inclined to give vague answers to questions about technique.  Nor am I inclined to present my subjective experiences as an objective model.<br/>
<br/>
What I had attempted to communicate, perhaps clumsily, is that oral storytelling is a fluid artform.  Trying to nail down "The Essence of the Art of Oral Storytelling" to a few bulleted keypoints seems awkward to me because I don't know the subject well enough to feel comfortable doing that.  I can, however, point to examples of oral storytelling I've come across in my own life that can prove illustrative or instructive for you. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's my background.  Oral storytelling is second nature in my family.   While other families would put on a video or show a lot of photographs, in my family we just tell the story.  It has nothing with being able to afford or operate the gadgets.  There is no formality about it at all, no "Now we will tell the story of . . . " moments.  It's simply what we do.  There's no passing the conch, no classes we took, none of that.  It's just the way we share our memories and bond with each other.  I can't explain it in a way that does justice to the experience.<br/>
<br/>
Quite bluntly, it's not something you can get competent with by sitting on theory.  I'm not saying theory is useless, but like gardening, at some point you need to get your hands dirty to see what it all means.                        </div>

                            There are two or three really good ways to learn oral storytelling, in my opinion.<br/><br/>1) Listen to other people tell stories, especially if they are good storytellers and you really enjoy listening to them.<br/><br/>2) Try to be like them.  Maybe re-tell the same stories, doing exactly what they did, but also telling some things a bit differently, trying to put your own spin on things.  This is, traditionally, how people learned to tell stories.<br/><br/>3) Practice reading stories aloud. Pick ones that you love with all your heart.  My favorites to read aloud are Salman Rushdie's <i>Haroun and the Sea of Stories</i> and Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i>.  Find yours.  Develop a good speaking voice, learn to SLOW THE FUCK DOWN and pause at the right places, learn to have nice innotation, and a variety of character voices.  These don't have to be goofy stereotypes, but can be subtle things you do to indicate differences of personality and tone.<br/><br/>Finally...<br/><br/>4) PAY ATTENTION TO THE WAY OTHER PEOPLE REACT WHEN YOU TELL STORIES.  Watch where you lose their attention.  Watch when you hook them good.  Watch when they laugh or grin or frown or gasp.  Figure out how to work with your audience so that they can anticipate where you're going and follow you there.  [This applies to roleplaying too.]<br/><br/>Personally, I've been really wanting to start a Story Time group in the Raleigh area where adults read stories aloud to each other.  I'll have to work on that.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, when I was in college I was the head of the Storytellers Guild for a while. Our weekly meeting was 'Milk &amp; Cookies Hour' where we'd get together in the Great Hall and read children's stories to each other in that lovely, booming room.<br/>
<br/>
I'd be hella up for doing that again. I'll bring my Fools of Chelm stories.                        </div>

                            I teach public speaking, and so I watch people tell stories all the time, usually in the service of making a larger point.  Here's what I tell my students:<br/>
<br/>
"Stories are the currency of human experience.  We all tell stories all the time, and we listen to the stories that other people tell us.  But we wrap them up in the back and forth of everyday conversation, so the stories we tell every day aren't as sharp as they need to be when we're in front of an audience.<br/>
<br/>
"Ultimately, every story boils down to this:  an Introduction, where you bring in the central characters and their situation; Complications, where you give the characters a problem that they have to deal with; and a Resolution, where we see how the characters deal with the problem.<br/>
<br/>
"So this is a story: 'I was standing around one day, when this guy comes up and starts giving me a hard time.  So I clocked him in the face.'<br/>
<br/>
"So is this:  'I was standing around one day, when this guy comes up and starts giving me a hard time.  So I just walked away.'<br/>
<br/>
"Notice," I tell my students, "how you know something about the character of the person who'd tell the first story, and about the person who'd tell the second story.  You know something about those guys!"  Because I want students to recognize how stories are connected to character, in the sense of persona.<br/>
<br/>
So, my answer to Shreyas is "Introduce a character, give that character something to react to, and tell how the character reacted."<br/>
<br/>
I realize that this doesn't get at specifics of technique or context; I was very interested in Spad's description of NPS interpretation, which seems to me like a very fruitful brainstorming tool.  And both Jonathan and Spads suggest paying attention to language, to how others use words and delivery to create a specific effect.  I want to think more about that, too.                        </div>
