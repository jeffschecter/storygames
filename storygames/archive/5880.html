Monsters have hit points equal to their dice pool, and get defeated when they have taken damage equal to that number. All well and good so far<br/><br/>What's bothering me is how to handle groups of monsters. The obvious answer is that each monster has it''s own pool, and players can fight them one on one, do damage, defeat them, and the like. It's simple, and I'm sure that will work fine most of the time, but it seems less elegant than I'd like. <br/><br/>The other option is to just treat a group of monsters as one monster with more dice, which is nice an elegant, but has flaws too. I'm looking for advice in which to choose, and I'll outline the pros and cons here.<br/><br/><b>Each monster has it's own pool</b><br/><br/>This is simple and obvious. It has the advantage that players can gang up on single monsters or face off against single opponents as they like. Also  it allows a reinforcement mechanic I have (converting GM successes into more monsters) to work smoothly. On the other hand it makes encounters somewhat harder to set up, because I just give the GM a dice budget for each encounter, and splitting it only allows so many members of a horde. Of course the GM can have a small bunch of monsters to start with and hope to roll reinforcements, but in fact a single monster with lots of dice is more likely to get reinforcements than a bunch of small ones.<br/><br/><b>All the monsters are one pool</b><br/><br/>This seems more elegant, the threat is just one dice pool, and as you do damage it just loses members, and it avoids all the problems with initiative, pairing combatants and the like. On the other hand it just turns reinforcement into healing, which is a lot less cool, and doesn't allow players (or monsters) to divide and conquer in the same way. It makes the encounter setup a lot easier though <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In writing this steam of consciousness I am leaning strongly towards the former ... but maybe someone has some cool suggestions for the encounter setup?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131647/#Comment_131647" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T10:54:20+00:00" title="February 29, 2008 10:54AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about like having 1 monster that was mooks.

So a 2 dice monster has 3 dice in chapter 1 and 5 in chapter 3. This means that a 4 dice encounter with one monster rolls chapter + 4 dice, while splitting it into 2 monsters with 2 dice gives you (chapter * 2) + 4 dice, which is more.<br/><br/>I'm beginning to think this might be fine, though, since two monsters with (say), 5 dice each have more hits than one with 7 dice, but less chance to win rolls, which balances out the advantage.<br/><br/>What I want to avoid is making an impossible encounter by just having too many little monsters. My idea was that if you want a horde then you just have a few monsters to start with and bring in reinforcements as needed, the only problem is that, since excess successes are converted into new monsters, a bigger dice pool gets more reinforcements, so even if you want a horde of monsters you are still better of starting with one 4 dice monster than a number of smaller ones.<br/><br/>I realise I could fix this with some sort of split pool, but the mechanics of what you do with successes are neat and work well right now, and I want to avoid a list of monster powers a la RBH                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131666/#Comment_131666" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T11:34:50+00:00" title="February 29, 2008 11:34AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite><acronym title="Spirit of the Century">SOTC</acronym>handles this pretty well with Minions, where each individual has one to three Stress points, but they can group up, effectively working as a single opponent with more "hit points".

I mean, since the HP and the characters' pools are the same thing, your system seems pretty much set up to do this already.  I'm assuming here that "pools" also represent the effectiveness of these monsters as well, which would decrease as, say, a gang of little ones loses members.  <br/><br/>I don't think that grouping the dice will reduce reinforcement to healing the way you see it.  In particular, if you treat each die as one member, it's really easy to say how many members are remaining.  It's even quick to do some simple division, if each member is represented by a small number, say 2 to 5 dice.  And hey, if a creature has 13 dice you're probably not grouping it anyhow.  <br/><br/>Having a physical representation of the number of individuals left in the group (even if a little division is potentially involved), as well as an easy method of mapping group effectiveness to numbers gives you a one up on any traditional systems I know that try grouping. ^^<br/><br/>-JT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131674/#Comment_131674" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T11:53:14+00:00" title="February 29, 2008 11:53AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jason, nice ideas there<br/><br/>The problem there, though, is that if I am rolling 5 dice and you are rolling 20 (for 5 creatures with 4 dice each) then I will be smushed ...

Perhaps I misunderstood your original mechanic, but I thought things would work just the way you said in your original post.  I didn't mean that the pools ever had to jump, just that for narration purposes you could just look at the pool and guess how many members were left based on how many Dice (=HP) were left.  You would in all cases dealing with mechanics just treat the group as a single entity.<br/><br/>Besides, if one person is trying to overcome a group of smaller monsters, there's nothing saying that each die can't represent 2 or 3 monsters.  If you're still worried about monster dice pools getting too big, you could just simulate "surrounding limits" by limiting the dice pool of any individual attack.<br/><br/>-JT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131741/#Comment_131741" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T13:54:33+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  1:54PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've often, in many games, made up a new, powerful monster and called it "a bunch of monsters".<br/><br/>Just like making up a new, powerful gun and calling it "two guns".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131751/#Comment_131751" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T15:03:08+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  3:03PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, I get where you are coming from about the dice pool = horde of monsters thing, and then have everyone deal with it as one<br/><br/>I think I might say that the GM can do it either way.
