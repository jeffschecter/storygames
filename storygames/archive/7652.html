I thought when the right cards were played, the fanmail pile increased, rather than it only becomes available when you play the right cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's an example:<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's say the producer has a budget that grants, uh... 8 pieces of fanmail.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it would look something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nEXAMPLE ONE:<br/>\n(crude model of the table)<br/>\n<br/>\n        Players<br/>\n<br/>\n       xxxxx<br/>\n        xxxx<br/>\n<br/>\n      Producer<br/>\n<br/>\nThe x's represent the fanmail to be freely shared by the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, on the other hand, is the example I keep running into:<br/>\nEXAMPLE 2:<br/>\n<br/>\n(crude model of table)<br/>\n<br/>\n         Players<br/>\n<br/>\n          x<br/>\n<br/>\n      Producer<br/>\n(behind blockade)<br/>\n       xxxxx<br/>\n        xxxx<br/>\n<br/>\nThe x's once again represent fanmail. The ones behind the producer will not be available to the players until someone plays the right cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I think this discourages players from awarding and spending fanmail. So I hope it's a misinterpretation of the rules.<br/>\nI've run a few games with the big pile in the center and they seem more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem, of course, is that I've misinterpreted a lot of the rules for Prime Time Adventures and I suspect the game I thought I was playing isn't the one I actually bought.

The Episode starts with the producer counting out the points which becomes his Budget which sits in front of him.  The middle of the table is empty.<br/><br/>When a Conflict happens, The Producer gets 1 card by default but has to spend Budget to get more cards.  As he spends Budget the points/tokens move from in front of him to the middle of the table.  This pool in the middle of the table is called The Audience Pool.<br/><br/>From the Audience Pool players award Fan Mail to each other.<br/><br/>So, yes, if you don't get in to Conflicts that The Producer is willing to spend Budget on, no Fan Mail is available to anyone.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169988/#Comment_169988" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T20:42:59+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  8:42PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really?

If one person is the most popular person in the group who everyone like the contribution of, they will get a ton of fan mail and others lesser on the social food chain will get less.  If you're doing something you love and everyone else despises, you will get less fan mail or you will stop doing what you love. It's not a perfect mechanic. (Nothing is!) What I try to do as Producer is pick up on characters we haven't seen in a while or aspects to a character that people responded to when pitching them and say "well, we haven't seen this yet, let's do something with that, what do you think?" and getting buy-in from other players for the "unpopular" person's contributions that way - but in the end even that is artificial. It works sometimes, other times not so much.<br/><br/>The great thing and the scary thing about collaboration is that people's tastes differ and what 4 people at the table love, 1 may find dull, and vice versa.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170007/#Comment_170007" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T23:32:15+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 11:32PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, not disagreeing with you, but from the example it sounds like the unhealthy social dynamic was present independent of fanmail.

It gives the incentive to come up with something new and better. It's also good to think of fanmail as a method to make shy/less creative players to become more open and willing to contribute to the game. I.e. giving fanmail to them for their attempts and stating what was fun rather than shunning them for things you didn't like. Negative approach is death spiral to the game - makes players go competitive and/or makes them play in their own bubbles and not interacting with each other .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170031/#Comment_170031" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T05:56:40+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  5:56AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2008 10:56AM by Matt Wilson.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to mention that I have a hard time imagining that the producer's going to spend 1 point of budget on a conflict <i>(edit: at the beginning of an episode)</i>, so it's not like the available pool is going to look like:<br/><br/>x<br/><br/>at any given point. <br/><br/>Other people who play, let me know if you've seen otherwise.

Which kinda skews things towards people who can think quickly on their feet, but also provides a better/level playing field for differing tastes in the direction of the action. This is why I've found PTA games where one of the players is the antagonist work really well (again, in games I've played in and all): They still get rewarded, perhaps even more so, when they come up with cool lines. And some folks are really good at playing TV villains.<br/><br/>I've seen it happen to the point where an antagonist (or someone working against the grain of the others) will drop a cool line or action: Everyone knows that person deserves the fanmail. So another player closes his eyes like he's squinting, and slowly draws out a chit from the pile and hands it to the guy; almost as if he's handing a bullet to his executioner. :-)<br/><br/>Again, the skew I've seen in our games often goes less towards popular/unpopular choices (though I don't deny that I've absolutely seen that as well!), and more towards folks who can come up with good lines on the fly.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170074/#Comment_170074" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T08:10:23+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  8:10AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite>Other people who play, let me know if you've seen otherwise.

Forever.  It's kind of like reverse hit points. It all gets lost if it's not turned into Fan Mail, which on the other hand is permanent.  If they feel like hoarding, they should be giving it out as quickly as possible and hoard the resulting Fan Mail points. And if they don't see the value in spending those points (or having them) start spending a bigger budget on conflicts that they really, really do not want to lose.<br/><br/>As producter, I compliment them, the actors and writers, on not getting big egos about their work as I scoop up the remaining Audience Pool and boast about how this will help pay for the new yacht.*<br/><br/>*I just realized the beautiful symmetry about the token economy.  Money (Budget) is spent to present the show to the audience (Audience Pool) which then become fans (Fan Mail) of events and actors which gives the actors and writes more clout in the production of future episodes (spending Fan Mail) the success of which can result in the studio putting more money into production (some Fan Mail returning to the budget).  Up until this point, I chalked it up to just being a really cool game mechanic, not an actual representation of entertainment production and feedback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377097/#Comment_377097" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T02:55:35+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  2:55AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2012 2:57AM by Arpie.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.
