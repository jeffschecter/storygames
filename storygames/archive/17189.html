It went pretty well, but not as fantastically well as I'd hoped. The game is intended to be a worked example of a great adventuring situation, with characters who have reasons for working both together and in opposition. The mechanics also encourage characterisation, with Key-like Arcs generating both XP and Nifty Points.<br/><br/>The setup is great: the nomadic Pashuans want their fertile valley back after the agricultural Kotalians invaded it a couple of generations ago. The Pashuans are hoping to use the wild spirit creature, the Broodmother, that lives in the valley to attack the Kotalians while the Pashuans invade and recapture it. The Kotalians are pretty much unaware that the attack is coming.<br/><br/>The situation is exploited well in the game, with divisions within the Kotalian military, both professional and personal, a Kotalian trader being coerced into setting up supply caches throughout the valley for the Pashuans, disaffected Kotalians worshipping the Broodmother for their own ends, and a bunch of bandits out to make a quick buck.<br/><br/>When I ran it, I started with the suggested opening scenes. A Kotalian trooper and the half-Kotalian, half-Pashuan guide were rushing back to the fort with news of the Pashuan invasion when they were attacked by the Broodmother's young. Meanwhile, the Kotalian trader was ambushed by the bandits disguised as Pashuans (though I dropped the ball on that one, forgetting that the "Pashuans" mentioned in the scene framing were actually the disguised bandits). When everyone eventually got back to the fort, the commander ordered all the troopers to the ambush site, where they discovered the bandit's hideout and the contents of several of the hidden caches. There was some to-ing and fro-ing with the bandits, resulting in the death of Trooper Redshirt and the disgraced trooper PC releasing his captured bandit leader in return for her telling him who was planting the caches. <br/><br/>The PCs then tried to track the impetuous and hopeless son of the fort commander who had decided that the path to glory lay in single-handedly killing the Broodmother. They stumbled across a group of Kotalian civilians (and a Pashuan shaman) attempting to summon the Broodmother, so that she could kill the (PC) adulterous husband of the coven leader. The PCs halted the ritual and the shaman made a deal to sabotage the Pashuan invasion in return for her support to make the shaman the Pashuan's leader. They sacrificed the wife to summon the Broodmother properly, only for the hopeless gloryhog to (inteptly) attack. <br/><br/>That was the end of the slot, so we called it a day, with the outcome of the Pashuan invasion being left to the next exciting episode. <br/><br/><br/>The game seemed to go fairly well, with all the players enjoying the session. As I said, it didn't quite go as well as I'd hoped.<br/><br/>One problem that wasn't the fault of the writeup was that I found some of the scene-setting hard work. That was mostly due to my lack of preparation and not reading the situation through thoroughly enough. But it was partly due to the situation setup not quite working. The suggested opening scene for the game has the Pashuans invading <i>right now</i>, which means that there's not much room for the characters to pursue their own selfish interests: dealing with the Pashuan invasion overrides most of their personal agendas. It also meant that the game played through quite quickly, so I'm not sure how easily I could have extended the game into the suggested two or three sessions. <br/><br/>There are, I think, a couple of ways to fix it. One is to move the time frame of the game earlier, to when the Pashuans are setting up the invasion. That gives more scope for the inter-PC rivalries to come out, as there isn't the pressure of the invasion to clamp down on the divisions in the Kotalian camp. It also opens up scope for intrigue. Someone's setting up the caches in the valley, someone's (perhaps) stealing from the fort for stuff to put in them, and someone's stealing the contents of the caches once they're set up. There's also a love triangle, and status games within the military chain of command. <br/><br/>The other fix is to play it more as a war story, with the issues of command, responsibility, and cowardice being played out, as you see in various war films. While that would work, it would need more detail about the invading Pashuan forces, the Kotalian defenders, and the civilians caught in the crossfire.<br/><br/>There was also a problem with the suggested PCs. one of them is the Pashuan war-leader, concerned with keeping his warband under control. All the other PCs are involved with each other in and around the Kotalian fort. That means that the Pashuan war-leader would spend most of his time on his own, with virtually no interaction with the other PCs. I'd just drop him as a PC, as I can't see how to integrate him with the rest of the game. <br/><br/>The final issue was with the mechanics. I really like what they're trying to achieve, but they don't seem to quite have the polish needed to deliver a really tight economy. The idea is that you generate Heat tokens by either playing to your Arc (i.e. Key) or using some of your abilities at a disadvantage. You spend Heat when you trigger the special  (Sparks) of your abilities, which are generally "reroll a die" or "shift a point from one die to another". We found in play that people generated a lot of Heat but spent very little. Quite often, there was little point using the Sparks as their use wasn't going to make a difference to the outcome. We also weren't clear whether you could activate the Spark same more than once in a roll.<br/><br/>(The extended, detailed combat system was good, but not wonderfully explained. I'd liked to have seen a worked example of a combat round in the rules, to more clearly show how it works.)<br/><br/>In conclusion, a good fun little scenario. Give it a try, but expect to have to give it a little work to make it truly sing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
