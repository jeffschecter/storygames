You're going to need 3 sessions at least to dig into the meat of a Transmission. If you've played Apocalypse World, you'll know what I'm talking about when I say that your first session of Technoir will basically be an "AW First Session" - free play, with the GM mostly in reactive mode, riffing off players' contributions to create story artifacts for reincorporation later, and the players' actions creating linkages between all those plot elements in that oh-so-awesome way Technoir does it.<br/><br/>To speed things up for convention play, I pre-generated characters with all but one Connection (and let them pick the last), let them buy some additional equipment, and took one of their Push dice from them before play began to be able to deal out some hurt early in the game and show off the dice mechanic. Even so, in a 4-5 hour game, we basically tend to get to the point where everyone is together and has some ideas of what to do next, and then time's up. That sucks for convention play, but would be a great first stopping point for a 3-4 session long game.<br/><br/>Enjoy!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358074/#Comment_358074" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T14:07:15+00:00" title="February  6, 2012  2:07PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>I've run 3 individual sessions of it now, all at conventions.<br/><br/>At least for your first time, do NOT plan it as a one-shot.

I've played Technoir 2-3 times now and never gotten past the first session (not the game's fault there). Each time we did character creation and dived into play and had a nice meaty cyberpunk conspiracy ready from the start. The only problem with playing as a one-shot (IME) is that it tends to cliffhanger endings that will leave you wanting another game (that you never manage to schedule . . .).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358159/#Comment_358159" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-07T06:54:38+00:00" title="February  7, 2012  6:54AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see an AP of that, Dylan. I don't think you're making it up, but I have a hard time seeing how to get the dice flow going and get a substantial number of elements introduced that rapidly, especially while people are still getting their feet wet, trying on their characters, etc. Could be a playstyle difference, or maybe there's something you're doing right that I'm not.<br/><br/>Or maybe it's the number of players? I've played with 6 once and 5 twice (excluding GM), and that's probably too many as the number of Transmission elements increases linearly with the number of players and linkages between elements potentially more than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358416/#Comment_358416" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-08T22:51:56+00:00" title="February  8, 2012 10:51PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run <i>Technoir</i> twice (both with Hong Kong transmission) with 3-4 players comfortably in 4 hours, with chargen, rules teaching, shopping (sigh), and plot developed in play. It could have used another hour for more plot, but as a way to demo to players how the system works, it worked well. I'd never try running it for 5 or 6, but then it's a rare game I'd run these days for 6 (Mountain Witch, Best Friends... I think that's all).<br/><br/>I've thought about pregen, especially to cut down on shopping, but player buyin to their characters is vital, so I find it worth the time.<br/><br/>Ryan Macklin has an excellent hack of Technoir to do the movie <i>Push</i>.
