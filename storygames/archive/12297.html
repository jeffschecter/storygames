And focused, intense one- or three-session games. But I like short, no-setup minigames too. They're ideal for less invested/formal gaming - sort of like playing a quick card game instead of a full night of Advanced Civilization.<br/><br/>Yesterday I was hanging out with Monica, and we tried out a new game I wrote (<a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/recursive-tales-of-the-infinite-multiverse" rel="nofollow">it's here</a>). I hadn't tried it yet, and had no idea how it would work out; we ended up having a lot of fun (my kids asked me this morning why we were laughing so much last night, which is probably one of the best questions kids can ask their parents).<br/><br/><b>So here's how it played out.</b><br/><br/>I started as Explorer, and decided this would be about a French Expressionist painter named Dupr\xe9. He was in his tiny attic, attacking a canvas with a razorblade and crimson paint. There was a knock on the door. Monica split the scene there - his friend Michel could come in, or his enemy Vladimir.<br/><br/>Next, Monica was the explorer. She went for Vladimir, and described his old, worn clothes - and then I split the scene; either he was a former rich man fallen on hard times, or he was in disguise! <br/><br/>We went on exploring threads for a while. In some threads, Dupr\xe9 died; killed by the werewolf Vladimir, who painted the canvas with Dupr\xe9's innards, or by human Vladimir who came up the stairs with a broken bottle. There were threads where Vladimir was a masked vigilante. In others, Dupr\xe9 went with his friend Michel to Opiumstrasse to sell the painting - to the shady art dealer Karamasov, who was a male Russian spy, or to the friendly and honest art dealer Karamasov, who was a woman with a supernatural light in her eyes.<br/><br/>After about an hour, we took a break - and didn't come back to the game; there was more to explore, but we had other things to do and talk about, so we ended it there. It was a good session.<br/><br/><b>Some thoughts on the game</b><br/><br/>- For us, it turned out to suit an over-the-top silly and dramatic style. NPCs were extreme caricatures, and people fought and died and threw bricks through windows and were revealed to be spies or vigilantes or werewolves.<br/>- Early on, I intentionally cut a scene short to see how that would work. It's possible to do - but later we found out there was much more satisfaction in letting a scene go on for a few minutes, to get some weight to the story thread before splitting it.<br/>- Towards the end (after 10-12 turns, I think) we found that some unexplored nodes were pretty similar - some threads seemed to converge. Perhaps there should be a pruning stage at some point (or points) where players can remove redundant nodes?<br/>- It was lots of fun seeing how the same character turned out very differently in different threads. <br/>- Being the explorer gives you a lot of power for that turn - you choose whether to explore the scary or funny threads, what story line <i>you</i> want to follow further.<br/>- I'll definitely play it again, because it has some ideas I'd like to explore.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275673/#Comment_275673" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T23:29:27+00:00" title="June 11, 2010 11:29PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2010 11:31PM by Matthijs.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and I took a picture of our story graph.

Still, those characters got a lot done in that time, phew.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.n4f.no/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=1370&amp;d=1276324263"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275707/#Comment_275707" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-12T08:56:24+00:00" title="June 12, 2010  8:56AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yet another nifty game Matthjis!<br/><br/>I'll see if I can drum up someone to play this with, but a couple quick thoughts just from looking it over aong with your AP above:<br/><br/><b>"- For us, it turned out to suit an over-the-top silly and dramatic style. NPCs were extreme caricatures, and people fought and died and threw bricks through windows and were revealed to be spies or vigilantes or werewolves."</b><br/><br/>It strikes me that this sort of oer-the-top play is very common for the first session or two in games where players have an almost unlimited control over new content, I recall Ralph Mazza watching similar kinds of over-the-top play occur when introducing people to Universalis. How many games of <i>Recursive </i>have you played? How many has Monica played?<br/><br/><b>- Towards the end (after 10-12 turns, I think) we found that some unexplored nodes were pretty similar - some threads seemed to converge. Perhaps there should be a pruning stage at some point (or points) where players can remove redundant nodes?</b><br/><br/>Or maybe not. Two thoughts on this. In one case, perhaps the players are recognizing a sort of  underlying pattern or weight of events running through the thing, even when other paths are taken. This is pretty common in alt.history SF and the old American "What If??" comics from Marvel. The other thought is that perhaps these things are acting as some sort of unconscious "flags"- a bit like Destiny Points in Archipelago, but created during play rather than as a preliminary to play                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275798/#Comment_275798" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-13T06:32:13+00:00" title="June 13, 2010  6:32AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2010 6:32AM by DanielSolis.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the trend towards gonzo play was described most succinctly in this analysis of <a href="http://samizdat.cc/cyoa/" rel="nofollow">Choose Your Own Adventure</a> books. The writer notices that the later cyoa books have far fewer branching paths than the earlier books. She wonders if this was simply market forces urging more linearity or something else... (Emphasis mine.)\n<blockquote>In another way, this trend mirrors the adoption of more recent new media. In the early days of the web, people flocked to what was unique to HTML, namely links, animated gifs, and the blink tag. A similar cautionless exuberance  marked the appearance of affordable typesetting systems  \u2013 the first time people without phototypositors  had access to typefaces beyond a choice of monospaced typewriter fonts.<br/><br/><b>When a world of new possibilities has just opened, it\u2019s hard to find the will for restraint. But, in time, people scale back the more gratuitous uses of this sort of glitz, moving from what\u2019s possible to what best suits the material.</b><br/><br/>It could be that the glut of choices in the early books reflected more a rush toward the new than a well-considered balancing of storytelling and reader-directedness. As the genre developed, the choice-based structure ceased being so novel that it was an experiential end in itself. Perhaps only then could it recede into its proper role as a gameplay mechanic \u2013 all the more potent when used judiciously.</blockquote>\nLike Robert, I'm curious how the game settles down after several sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275800/#Comment_275800" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-13T07:20:56+00:00" title="June 13, 2010  7:20AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was the World Premiere of the game, basically - first time I played it, first time she played it.

However, even though it was over the top, I didn't feel like it went completely gonzo; some scenes were pretty down-to-earth, and we didn't (for instance) bring in UFOs, The Hulk or other mood-breaking "funny" elements.
