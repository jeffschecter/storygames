Now it's even become common to openly criticize SG for not being interesting enough or for having discussions that are hopelessly muddled.  And, looking back, while some of those discussions brought up good points that were worth discussing, mostly they just alienated a lot of people and distracted from the more positive work of playing and making games.  So, in a word: I worry that talking about resentment is just going to create more resentment.  That seems pretty likely.<br/><br/>In general, I think if you talk to the folks who've actually been involved in indie games for a while, nobody thinks indie games are inherantly better -- as games -- than games published in some other fashion.  How could you think that? It's illogical and stupid.  Some games are better, sure.  But there's nothing about self-publishing that makes you a better game designer or writer.  Actually, it often makes games a lot harder to finish, since you have to do everything yourself.  Now, there are some folks who think -- for some very good reasons -- that the traditional model of game publication and distribution is messed up or even, in some cases, actually immoral in the way that it values the IP and labor of creators.  That really depends on how you view things, but it's a perspective that's easy to understand even if you don't agree with it.  But that's not talking about games or styles of play, it's talking about publishing models.<br/><br/>So, can't we just agree that the "resentment machine" or whatever is bullshit and try our best to focus on positive things like games we like?  I guess I'm not sure what we can really accomplish by having a discussion about how much we suck.  Because inevitably, when people talk about how much "we" suck, they're not including themselves, so it's just more resentment, really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347963/#Comment_347963" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T11:39:23+00:00" title="November  5, 2011 11:39AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2011 4:56AM by Todd_L.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>so it's just more resentment, really.</blockquote>\nDamn good point!

There's no reason you have to trash things you don't like in order to promote things you do.<br/><br/>Critical analysis of all sorts of games and play -- including games and playstyles we really like and those we may not like as much -- is a HUGE part of getting better at both playing and creating games.  That involves picking games and moments of play apart and talking about what worked and what didn't work.  That doesn't mean you pass judgment on the games or the people involved; you just proved that both have value because they taught you something about games, even it was through providing an experience that didn't click with you.  Critical discussion of a game is a way of valuing it and learning from how it goes about attempting to do something. Even the infamous inclusion of underwater combat rules in the <i>Kevin &amp; Kell RPG</i> now stands as a lesson other people can learn from.<br/><br/>There's nothing about aesthetics or commerce that means you have to heavy-handedly trash other ways of doing things when you promote a creative work.  You can just say: "Hey, look at this!  I think this is pretty interesting!  Maybe you'll like it too!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347998/#Comment_347998" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T15:07:24+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  3:07PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2011 3:07PM by Todd_L.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnathan--   I'm a bigger fan of the essay than of my own words about it, in this thread.<br/><br/><br/>How much do you agree or disagree with the essay's premise?

That doesn't seem like big news, but it's definitely a thing.  And I agree that the internet is often used as a tool to announce those identities, bond together with similarly-identified people, and talk mostly to each other.  I agree that it sometimes gets reduced to criticizing people who consume other kinds of things.  So, yeah, all that.<br/><br/>But while sometimes the indie games community gets caught up in that, I feel like -- at its best, and even in its default modes -- it's not like that, especially when people get together in meatspace at a convention or meetup.  Really, the internet version of the indie games community is a poor and temporary replacement that allows us to stay in contact when we can't all be together, playing games and having great conversations.  That wasn't clear to me until I started going to conventions and meetups, when I assumed that most things of importance happened online, at the Forge.  But it's critical to remember that places like SG (or any website) aren't representative of what it means to be a consumer/producer of indie games.  Something like Go Play NW is a much better example.<br/><br/>And what you see there doesn't look anything like the L'Hote article you linked: it's almost an explicit rejection of that.  Which is why I feel like talking about applying this kind of thinking to the way the indie community sometimes behaves on the internet -- when that isn't really what it's about, at all -- is perhaps not the most productive thing.  Because, when you look at us in the flesh, when we're being community to each other, it's not like that at all.

Mostly because it reminds me of William Gibson, and his ideas about brands, identity, art and consumerism. Neat topics of discussion, and I like how you're tying it in to ideas we as a community hold to be Truth. In general. Generally speaking. <br/><br/>My response became really wordy. Fair warning.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of these types of articles recently on the interwebs. There was one I read last week about how "our generation" has been screwed by the economy and our parents. (ah, <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/my-generation-2011-10/" rel="nofollow">here it is</a>) How we're self-abosorbed idealists who were told we could do anything we wanted, only to enter the real world and find that to be horribly untrue. I'm fairly sure every generation goes through this stage of absurd self-reflection. We have all these problems, but we're actually ok. I'm finding these articles, while entertaining, to be kind of trite! It's a conceited type of self-reflection because it seems so ridiculously generic. To me, the article you're citing does a similar thing, only involving art and technology. "Websites are clearly a tool of critics who don't actually know anything about art and just want to sell things to you." Yikes.<br/><br/>What struck me most in the article was this paragraph:<br/><br/><i>It is no surprise that the urge to rear winners trumps the urge to raise artists. But the nagging drive to preach the value of culture does not go unnoticed. The urge to create, and to live with an aesthetic sense, is admirable, and if inculcated genuinely-- which is to say, in defiant opposition to the competitive urge, rather than as an uneasy partner to it-- this romantic artistic vision of life remains the best hope for humanity against the deadening drift of late capitalism. In the context in which this cheery and false vision of the artistic life is actually experienced, self-conscious creativity becomes sublimated into the competitive project and becomes twisted. Those raised with such contradictory impulses are left unable to contemplate the stocks and suspenders lifestyle that is the purest manifestation of the competitive instinct, but they are equally unable to cast off the social climbing aspirations that this lifestyle represents. They are trapped between their rejection of the means and an unchosen but deep hunger for the ends.</i><br/><br/>This speaks so much to me about the state of our aesthetic culture, still stuck in the post-romantic idea of the artist. In the art world I see it shifting, artists returning to a more technical and scientific bent than ever before, despite the heavy influence of post-modern conceptualism and break down of "what is art". But this isn't just an art world thing, it's a social thing too. We still very much see things in "the Romantic ideal of how they should be" and "the awful reality of what they are". I think this is the biggest problem with what the article is saying. That polarization doesn't really speak of the Truth of creating art. It just talks about this funny idea we have about it. And the idea that all art could only be created for consumption or the pure sake of beauty is ridiculous. Art has always been sold, used as propaganda, in ritual, for drinking wine out of... art has a purpose and it's not just the act of creating it. And artists (and game designers) are making things they care about, and making a living doing that. It's hard work!<br/><br/>The reason I get on my art soapbox is this: <b>how can art and design (the creation of something, games, say) be only for the sake of consumption? And how can we not enter a discourse about the meaning of the things we make?</b><br/><br/>I think the article is a valid critique of <i>some</i> mindless media on the web. But I don't think that's what the internet culture does, as a whole. Nor what the "indie" culture in gaming does either. <b>I think that the cool thing about these two cultures that ties them together is the freedom to be able to create what you want and share it with the world in a way that has been previously inaccessible due to limited technology. Both the internet and independent publishing have opened doors for artists and creators to break into territories previously uncharted. How fucking cool is that.</b> To quote William Gibson on the awesomeness of the internet: "It will bring about the extinction of the nation-state as we know it... I think it will be as big a deal as the creation of cities." Our communities, the fact that we can even have them in this manner, are incredible to me. To be able to create these meta-cultures online, and at conventions, and on blogs that can reach audiences and include discussions with people from all kinds of cultures and places around the world about the same things we're passionate about.<br/><br/>It's so funny to me that people often want to demonize technology in this manner. I'm constantly excited about the possibilities available to me. While I think it's always good to be aware of what you're doing, this self-deprecating approach seems counter-productive. I, personally, don't take sides. I don't feel the need to be hip by indentifying with underground art or the latest indie shit you've probably never heard of. I appreciate good design wherever I see it. You say that the "indie design community" is leading gaming in aesthetics? I'm not sure that's true. The fact that we like to talk about design so much is pretty awesome. <b>Really, I think that might be all that makes us distinct: our desire to enter into endless discussions about design and what it means in relation to our creations.</b> Maybe?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348037/#Comment_348037" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T19:41:58+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  7:41PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2011 7:42PM by Todd_L.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>This speaks so much to me about the state of our aesthetic culture, still stuck in the post-romantic idea of the artist....We still very much see things in "the Romantic ideal of how they should be" and "the awful reality of what they are"....this funny idea we have...</blockquote>\nYes!

Artists can't sell out unless they adopt the pure vs. consumption model. If you reject that as nonsense, regardless of how underground and supposedly obsolete and unprofitable (WHAT YOU TAKE THAT BACK MY GAMES ARE NOT OBSOLETE) what you make is always important and people will always want to give you money for it. Not because you need some ego boost to ensure what you're making matters. Because it actually does.

Rejecting the "Pure vs Consumable" model does not mean the art I make is necessarily important or that people will want to give me money for it.  I get inspired to make some pretty fringe-ass art.

I'm still fighting for consumer brain-space, and I have to <i>earn</i> it, and my ideas and products may or may not be winners.  I don't really see any alternative to this kind of "need to win" (just to refer back to the article)... and, looking at it from the consumer's point of view, I don't think I'd <i>want</i> there to be an alternative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348137/#Comment_348137" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-06T16:59:52+00:00" title="November  6, 2011  4:59PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2011 5:08PM by Todd_L.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>a <i>sincere</i> expectation like that strikes me as a little insane.</blockquote>\nInsane, but understandable.
