YOU ARE DEPRESSED AND NEED A REMINDER ABOUT HOW THERE ARE GREAT PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT YOU.<br/>2. YOU HAVE LEGALLY CHANGED YOUR NAME TO ANY OF THE UNCLAIMED KEY FIGURES IN THE SEA DRACULA RPG,<br/>WHICH IS TO SAY THAT BOTH "JASON MORNINGSTAR" AND "SEA DRACULA" ARE OFF-LIMITS, BECAUSE OTHER FOLKS HAVE<br/>CHANGED THEIR NAMES TO THOSE FUNNY MONIKERS. <br/><br/>helpers / creators:<br/>you must assure that all the stuff you put in this thread can jump into the present for tony completely free of copyright <br/>which would stop it from being sold or whatever.<br/><br/>we'll make a thing which will either be given away or sold for a small fee, proceeds going to GPNW.<br/>guesses that pdf will be free, print will have a profit margin for GPNW.<br/>or whatever. depending on what it turns into.<br/><br/>the gift will be presented to tony at GPNW. if any of you punks tells him any details before-hand,<br/>then you'll be labeled "doesn't play well with others", which is about the lowest of the low for our types.<br/><br/>i like my idea, i think tony will like it too... help me make it awesome.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>(space for tony not to see what's up if he opens the thread)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>ok.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>here we go:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b><span style="color: #66CC66;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dowler's Delvers</span></span></b><br/><br/>a game for one player.<br/>it will be a timed game, with the player attempting to beat the clock.<br/><br/>the player will control a group of delvers, going through tunnels, getting treasure, killing monsters,<br/>you know, the usual. <br/>the mapping techniques will make judicious use of tony's brilliant hand-as-measuring-tool idea<br/>(which i believe he stole from the romans); that corridors will be a finger-width or a thumb-width,<br/>maybe a hand-width.<br/><br/>i was thinking that the game would be playable on a commute by bus,<br/>meaning that more than one or two dice would be crazy, and we couldn't use tony's roll-the-die-and-see-where-it-lands-on-the-page<br/>thing, which he <i>also</i> got from the romans; but i am totally willing to toss that bus-friendliness out.<br/><br/>the timer comes in with the length of the delve. every member of the party eats one food-unit every X minutes,<br/>where at level one X=like 15, and that goes down two minutes a level, or maybe just X=10 minutes at level 2<br/>and 5 minutes at level three.<br/><br/>hmm. i just had some idea about drawing the walls in one color, and just drawing a line wherever the party goes,<br/>so it's a matter of physically drawing it... in another color.   hmm..<br/><br/>&amp;, like, how about monster generation? how do we do that? how do we make treasures?<br/><br/>&amp; for clarity's sake, i imagined this using a lot of paper, like going off the bottom of one sheet and<br/>continuing on the top of another.<br/>in its own way, this creates confusion about getting lost in the tunnels, and takes time figuring out<br/>"where you are" as you flip to the right page.<br/><br/>&amp; what about fighting? how does that work, how is that fun?<br/><br/>&amp; how do you generate a party?<br/>is the "main character" differently powered than the rest of the party?<br/>is there a "main", or do you just load up on people when you go back to town,<br/>regardless as to who died?<br/><br/>&amp; how do you get food, and how much food and treasure can the party carry?<br/><br/>so far we might need:<br/>an assload of paper<br/>colored pencils<br/>a digital timer, ideally one which will give like one beep every time fifteen minutes (or whatever) passes.<br/>an eraser<br/>probably some dice, because as i once read in a review of the dragonlance 5th age rpg,<br/>"leaving my dicebag at home makes me want to stay home with it".<br/><br/>and that is not the image we are trying to achieve.<br/><br/><br/>there we have it!<br/>you all are dears and lovely creative devils, <br/>so get your brains in gear and let's churn this out.<br/><br/>also, any aesthetically correct artwork would be lovely. i'm picturing black hand-drawn lines, with minimal shading, <br/>and weirdo creatures and vaguely wimpy and mediocrely-armored heroes.<br/><br/>&amp; this could wind up as a two-sheet or a little booklet, or whatev'.<br/><br/><br/><br/>get goin'.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204836/#Comment_204836" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T18:27:09+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  6:27PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt; the game would be playable on a commute by bus<br/><br/>The other people on the bus should be the inputs to determine party composition, NPCs, and monsters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204838/#Comment_204838" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T18:43:13+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  6:43PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm commuting over the Bay via bus to SF on Monday.

Bah, dice!  Dice are easy to lose on a bus and require a solid surface.  What about a deck of cards?  That way you could also assign cards to your fellow busgoers ("that guy is clearly a Jack of Hearts, whereas she's probably a Four of Clubs...") and pull them in as substitutes when you weren't drawing the cards you wanted.<br/><br/>Red cards are new monsters.  Black cards are reserve delvers.  You use the number to determine which direction the tunnel goes (and whether it splits) and an evens/odds system to determine who takes a loss in a fight.  If you use up your regular deck, you reshuffle your discard pile, BUT food is consumed by pulling cards out of the bottom of the discards and putting them back in the box.  When you run out of cards the game is over.<br/><br/>I like Jason's idea too!<br/><br/>Also, I demand that we run a game of this at GPNW as a LARP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204920/#Comment_204920" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T13:10:25+00:00" title="May  2, 2009  1:10PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2009 1:56AM by Paul_Riddle.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A spin on Brendan's concept; if you use playing cards as the primary system mechanic, then combat could be resolved like a game of War. (Ace = 14, King = 13, Queen = 12, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nStart by drawing two "Delver" cards at random as well as one treasure card.<br/>\n<br/>\nUse Brendan's concept for generating the dungeon and determining when an encounter occurs. I also like concept of removing cards from the deck for food. Maybe pull X cards from the deck every Y minutes and/or pull Z cards per N delvers from the deck every encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen an encounter occurs, draw a number of monster cards equal to twice the current level of the dungeon (Level 1 being the easiest, each time you go one level further down into the bowels of the dungeon, draw two more cards for the monsters)<br/>\n<br/>\nSum the cards on each side. The side with the lowest total loses one card at random -- NPC/Monster dies. If the delvers beat the monster, the card becomes the treasure and it has value proportional to the number on the card. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter each round, the players and monsters can choose to continue the fight or run away. If the monsters run away, the PC's get one of the monster cards at random as dropped loot. If the PC's run away, discard one of their collected treasure cards at random. If the PC's have no treasure, then nothing is lost -- don't need to add injury to insult ;). If the fight continues, repeat the process until combat is resolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the party returns to "town," the player can discard treasure cards whose total is greater than or equal to the sum of the values of the delver cards to hire an additional delver. The player can also discard a treasure card to buy "food," thus replenishing the deck by a number of cards equal to the value of the treasure card discarded.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the party enters the dungeon with more delvers than two times the current dungeon level, they encounter the "boss." Draw a number of cards for the monsters equal to twice the current dungeon level + 1 or # of delvers - 1, which ever is greater. Combat mechanics are the same as above. If the PC's win, they proceed to the next dungeon level and the stakes go up.<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\nOK, that was a lot of stream of conscious brainstorming... do with that as you will. I'll add that I think this concept is really cool and it would be a fun gift. I'll look forward to playing it at GPNW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205183/#Comment_205183" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T11:08:16+00:00" title="May  4, 2009 11:08AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, taking this in a bit of a different direction, what about each combat having 'slots' that you assign your randomized whatever (dice rolls, cards, whateva) to. So maybe:<br/><br/>Orc Slavers!<br/>Victory: (1-2 = Lose this dice, 3-8 = Win, 9-0=Route)<br/>Loot: (1-2 = Nothing: lose this dice, 3-8 = One extra dice, 9-0 = Two extra dice)<br/>Surprise: ...<br/>Freed Slaves:<br/><br/><br/>That'd probably lend itself to a bigger book, since you need to determine what those slots mean and either provide a way to make more or provide a lot. It's kind of similar to Storming the Wizard's Tower, I think, based on Vincent's blog post about it. I like the 'encounter' feel of it. Kind of Like 4E, without actually playing out the encounter.<br/><br/>The room could have some influence on the rolls, or something like that. Amount of manuvering room, number of entrances/exits, random featuers could all effect how you assign dice. "This room is huge, so I can assign the same dice to two slots." I also like the entropy idea. I'd love if that meant increased randomness the further in you got until it all kind of melts down. I guess that'd be possible by starting with only, say, half a deck, and each room adds more cards until you have no idea what your next card will be. I'm having a tough time conceptualizing how to make the rules reflect the chaos behind you.<br/><br/> Maybe each dice is a delver? Leveling up = bigger dice. <br/><br/>What if the slots were physical locations in the room? So you put the dice somewhere, it gives you some bonus but maybe puts that dice in more danger. Some kind of algorithm for generating rooms, deciding where enemy 'slots' are and where you can 'slot' in your delvers...<br/><br/>Okay, I may just be on an entirely different page, but this whole thing got me thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205196/#Comment_205196" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T11:51:45+00:00" title="May  4, 2009 11:51AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, between this and [a certain product that will be released at GPNW] there sure is a lot of fanboyism/friendship going on on the west coast this year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205199/#Comment_205199" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T11:56:42+00:00" title="May  4, 2009 11:56AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, it's all just elitist "cool kids" obsessed with the New Hotness!

If the fight continues, repeat the process until combat is resolved.<br/></blockquote>\nPaul, I think you've got some great mechanics developing here.  I want to just kind of explore them a little more:<br/><br/>So say we get a delvers-monster encounter on level 2, with four delvers:  Jack/11, 8, 5, 4.  We draw four monster cards:  Queen/12, 9, 6, 2.<br/><br/>Sums:  delvers 28, monsters 29.  Delvers lose a random card...  and that's pretty much it, isn't it?  Is there any point to continuing to do sums?  The monsters' total is going to be greater every time, until the delvers run away or all die.<br/><br/>So let's grab the "War" idea, flip over both packs and shuffle, then draw one random card from each side.  In this case I drew a 5 from the delvers and a 2 from the monsters.  Monsters lose that card?  Or maybe a different random card from the undrawn-yet ones?  I think the second option would make combat more interesting and random, so I'll do that.<br/><br/>They lost their 8.  Flip two more cards...  Monsters Q, delvers 4.  Delvers lose another card--their Jack.  ouch.<br/><br/>Final two cards:  delvers 9, monsters 6.  Since the delvers win the last draw, they win the combat, and get a random monster card (the 8) as treasure.  If they'd tied, we could have reshuffled the remaining cards for each side and gone through again.  If one side had lost so many cards that they COULDN'T draw a card when the time came, they would automatically lose.<br/><br/>Of course, either side could have chosen to run away at any time.  (Did you have a mechanism in mind for choosing when the monsters would flee, Paul?  I'm still sort of thinking of this from a "player wants delvers to win" perspective.<br/><br/>This seems like a fun minigame!  Jackson, is this anything like what you had in mind, or are we wildly diverging?  Sage, I think your idea sounds really intriguing--I totally want to see it more developed as a solo game, although I'm not sure it fits the "play on the bus" light-handling aesthetic that we seem to be working with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205248/#Comment_205248" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T13:39:24+00:00" title="May  4, 2009  1:39PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there a bus that drives around downtown Seattle?<br/><br/>Just sayin...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205250/#Comment_205250" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T13:43:09+00:00" title="May  4, 2009  1:43PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2009 1:47PM by sage.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brendan, you're right that I'm probably missing the bus part, but I have a hard time imagining any of these working on a bus, to be honest. Seems like the smallest amount of stuff we've talked about is one sheet of paper at a time (with moving between pieces), a pencil, and cards split up into 2-3 piles (deck, monsters, delvers?). I'm not sure I could manage it on a bus.<br/><br/>I was trying to think of a one-player game, presumably with some type of 'winning,' that could be played with just the pencil and paper. Seems like it always ends up a bit more puzzle-ish, which doesn't work to well since there would have to be a list of puzzles or something, and I don't think it would add much to the fiction (thin as it may be).<br/><br/>I'm thinking my dice/slots idea might work because you'd end up with a room (by some algorithm/process/creativity) complete with monsters, then roll your (single) dice a few times to generate the numbers for your party, then slot them into the room as best you can. At worst I think you might end up with one dice of each size.<br/><br/>But hey, I like the card idea to. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As far as taking these ideas further: as John and Paul already know, I have WAY too many half-written things being playtested right now, but if this thread doesn't grow it some more I'll think about it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205479/#Comment_205479" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T16:35:01+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  4:35PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            sage, let me see if i got this right:<br/>a "slot" is an option in the room, to be used with... kind of like those beloved Otherkind dice in Ghost/Echo;<br/>that there would be results the room would ask for, and you'd roll dice and pick from the die results for each "slot" in the room?<br/>is that right?<br/><br/>for the record, i'm also thinking of this from a "players want delvers to win" perspective.<br/><br/>&amp; i think, you know, we got really awesome stuff beginning, so there's no reason to hold onto the Bus Paradigm. <br/>like, my other play-it-on-a-bus game* also grew out of that stage, this was kind of a revival of that idea- but, i mean, <br/>busses are weird and don't give a lot of space to the potential gamer.<br/><br/>a riff on the WAR idea: instead of two decks, what if there was a slightly larger piece of cardstock which was a game-aid,<br/>that you had in the middle of a single deck? you'd shuffle the deck, count down 26 cards and stick the aid in, <br/>and then deal off the top for delvers and off the bottom for monsters. The aid would help you insert cards back into the middle <br/>of the deck, above the aid for the delvers and below it for the monsters.<br/><br/>now, the downside of this is that it would seriously detract from the deck's simultaneously being used to generate random dungeon stuff,<br/>like rooms and traps and treasure. or competing groups of delvers.<br/><br/>or i was also thinking about christian's new (?? i mean, if it's not new then why bother, so let's assume it's new) rules for, um, other goals<br/>besides defeating the enemy in combat... this is still riffing off of sage's idea of "slots", i realize.<br/><br/>anyway, there's a bunch of stuff you have to do simultaniously, like kill monsters and rescue people and stop the statue mechanism from smashing<br/>the carafe of Mixture above the exit back, and your delvers all give you either set numbers to which you can add your cards (unrevealed drawn cards)<br/>or some dice or something which represent tools or general life or something... no, totally cards and dice.<br/>the cards are what can be lost. the dice can die, too (pfff) maybe they can move the length of your finger or something?<br/><br/>oh yeah, and how do we generate rooms and monsters and traps and treasure, and how do we know if the trapped elven princess speaks common, let alone can tell us the back way into the black dragon's layer and how to find the secret amulent to destroy it?<br/>like, does she trust us? can we convince her, or does she even know?<br/><br/>minimum of tables.<br/><br/>compute.<br/><br/><br/>(*sigh, it's true)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205481/#Comment_205481" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T16:37:10+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  4:37PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oop, and i gotta say, i am totally stoked to play Twelve Dollars Or A Punch In The Face, because with all this giftyness,<br/>i bet i'd even come out in the black.

So the encounter says you need to allocate one dice to victory, two dice to injuries, 1 dice to treasure, whatever. The total of the dice tells you what you get out of that category, either on a per encounter basis or based on some general rules.<br/><br/>So a possible encounter:<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Echoing Hall full of Orcs</b></span><br/><i>Victory</i>: 1 dice <br/><i>Injuries</i>: 2 dice<br/><i>Noise (Special)</i>: 1 dice<br/>A high roll in this slot means you manage to keep your skirmish quiet, even in the huge echoing cave around you. A low roll means everyone within the dungeon hears you.<br/>1-2: Like a bull bowling in a library. You're so loud, the monsters in the next room are able to bring the pain. As soon as this encounter is resolved, create another encounter. You don't roll again for this encounter, instead subtract one from each dice (minimum 1) and reuse them.<br/>3-4: What a ruckus. Everyone know's you're coming, subtract one from each dice you roll in the next encounter (minimum one).<br/>5-6: Quiet... for a battle. No effect<br/>7-8: Sneaky. You take your enemies by surprise, reroll any once dice in your next encounter.<br/>9-10: Very Sneaky. Reroll as many dice as you want in your next encounter.<br/>11-12: Like ninjas in a padded room. After rolling dice for your next encounter, you may create a new encounter to replace it AND reroll as many dice as you want when recreating.<br/><br/>The effects of Victory would be defined in some general area (since all/most encounters have a Victory slot):<br/><b>Victory:</b><br/>The roll in this slot indicates the general outcome of the battle, including who wins. <br/>1-2: Delvers Routed - Your enemies overwhelm you, driving you back. Go back to the room you entered from and create a new encounter there.<br/>3-4: Escape - When things stop going your way you manage to cut your losses. Exit to any room adjacent to this one.<br/>5-6: Deadlock - You're too evenly matched, no one wins. Roll against this same encounter again, but you may keep any one roll you currently have.<br/>7-8: Victory - You win! You can leave the room on your own terms<br/>9-10: Decisive Victory - Ain't nothing that can stand up to your massive magical prowess/muscles/skills. You can leave the room on your own terms and add one to your total in any other slot.<br/>11-12: Massacre - What enemies? You mean that bloody pile on the floor? You can leave the room on your own terms and you can keep any single dice roll from this encounter and reuse it in the next as your momentum carries you forward.<br/><br/>Likewise, Injury would be a common one defined in some other section:<br/><b>Injury:</b><br/>Any delver dice assigned to Injury and injured.<br/>d4: Adds a -1 penalty to the dice until the dice is used in a Rest slot.<br/>d6: Becomes a d4<br/>d8: Becomes a d6<br/>d10: Becomes a d8<br/>d12: Becomes a d10<br/><br/>I'm imagining starting out with a party of mostly d4s and d6s. 'Low level' encounters would let you double up dice on victory and have few if any slots for bad stuff. I think Death might be a slot that removes the dice permanently, which might be a good thing for a Injured d4. Levelling would probably be increased dice size, but I'm not sure when it would happen (maybe you get 'improvement points' per encounter? Or it's a slot?). I could also see 'special abilities' like this:<br/><br/><b>Lesser Mirror Image</b><br/>When you use this ability, you can use the dice it's associated with in two slots in the next encounter but the dice is Inured afterwards.<br/><br/><b>Mirror Image</b><br/>When you use this ability, you can use the dice it's associated with in two slots in the next encounter but the dice is given a -1 afterwards (unless it's a d4, sometimes you're just so weak it doesn't matter).<br/><br/><b>Mirror Image</b><br/>When you use this ability, you can use the dice it's associated with in two slots in the next encounter (and nothing bad comes of it).<br/><br/><br/><br/>An added layer to this could be that the slots are in some way determined by the room. So, maybe you draw some shape, then based on the level of encounter you get certain obstacles to place in the room, and their placement affects the placement of others? In this case, the 'slots' could literally be where that character is fighting/casting/skilling/dying.<br/><br/>I'd like to bring more roleplaying into it, but I'm not really sure how. Also notably absent is the cool entropy aspect that I'm all for. There's some bits I like to this, but it also feels more boardgame-y than RPG-ish. Granted, I'm not sure how much of an RPG it can be for one player? (I'm sure someone smarter than I can solve that problem.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205757/#Comment_205757" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T15:04:13+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  3:04PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A random idea for a semi-random randomizer:  hundredths of a second readout on a digital watch with a stopwatch function.

Hell, you could assign delver types to sets of numbers and of letters, and the first plate that you see is your "party.":\n<table cellpadding="4"><tr><td>1-3</td><td>A-H</td><td>Fighter - Master of the beat-down<br/></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>I-K</td><td>Cleric - Master of the prop-up<br/></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>L-N</td><td>Mage - Master of AoE at range<br/></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>O-Q</td><td>Monk - Master of AoE in melee<br/></td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>R-V</td><td>Thief - Master of subterranean challenges<br/></td></tr><tr><td>9-0</td><td>W-Z</td><td>Ranger - Master of surface-world challenges</td></tr></table>\n(I am groping for a small number of classes with high niche protection; Ranger would mean it's not all dungeon delving, maybe you have to get "there and back again," too?)<br/><br/>Just a thought, riffing on the whole "play in a vehicle" angle and with y'all apparently wanting a randomness rather than resource game.
