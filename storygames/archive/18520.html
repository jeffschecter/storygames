Having recently come in out of the cold from only playing traditional games, I'm trying to get my head around the other ways in which you can play. (To that end I am going to be <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18505/division-of-roles-in-lady-blackbird" rel="nofollow">running Lady Blackbird</a> soon). Particularly, I'd like to learn more about the different extent to which games can be pre-planned vs improvised, and how you blend the two kinds of content.<br/><br/>As always, if this has been asked before, point me there instead, apologies, etc..<br/><br/>The problem is, as many have noted before, that a lot of games have very little in the text about how they should actually be run. What I would like to put together in this thread is a rough overview of the different points on the spectrum that people play with, with example games that really encourage this mode of play.<br/><br/>At one extreme we have a game where there is initially no setting (not even implied), no prep, no characters, and everything is discovered through play. At the other, I guess, would be a completely railroaded game, perhaps with a dose of illusionism to make it easier to swallow.<br/><br/>What I'd like is for people to describe points on this spectrum, with an example of a game that not just supports that mode of play but actually specifically encourages (or insists) on it in the rules. e.g. Apocalypse World clearly insists on one kind of play: "Prep circumstances, pressures, developing NPC actions, not (and again, I\u2019m not fucking around here) NOT future scenes you intend to lead the PCs to." <br/><br/>(It would also be great (although less important) to have a quick comment along the lines of whether this play mode supports narrativistic/simulationist/gamist play well or not - I ask this question not knowing whether the answer might be "all of them for all them" or something very restrictive.)<br/><br/>A quick note: I know SG discourages abstract theoretical conversations. But the point of this thread is anything but: As a roleplayer without contact to a RP community outside of the internet, I'm the one who introduces new ideas to my group. The purpose of this thread for me is so that I can have my horizons expanded to different kinds of play - <em>and then play them</em>. So this is very practical, really.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416765/#Comment_416765" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-21T05:10:24+00:00" title="June 21, 2013  5:10AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, the game that everyone raved about for it's world creation on the fly is Dogs in the Vinyard. The town creation system uses relationship maps and the conflict system is one where failure is as useful as success in outcome. Dungeon World is a good example of the "World" games that is close enough to traditional D+D that you can see how a narrative style of play (that is found in many story games) works. <br/><br/>The theory part that is worth thinking about is about play styles. When we play a game where the pain and destruction of our own character is a normal part of the game you've got to like doing that. If this doesn't appeal, many story games don't have a lot to offer (at least in terms of fun). Lady Blackbird is a good place to start to try out the field.

I've read the AW rules. As far as I understand, in AW the MC has some fairly clearly mapped out threats which consists of NPCs, environments and so on, and some tools for reminding themself how they will progress (the countdown clocks) and then the events are improvised from these "forces" in response to the players' choices.<br/><br/>Do most story games operate on a similar system? Or are most more improvised? Or less? I'm trying to get pegs in the ground to understand the options.<br/><br/>This is my mental model so far, from most improv to least:\n<ol>\n<li>Lady Blackbird: Initial characters, setting, and questions (bangs), everything improvised from there</li>\n<li>Apocalypse World: Initial characters, setting, fronts (threats). Improvised from there, but with GM updating fronts and planning more and between sessions</li>\n<li>D&amp;D (assuming you used a pre-written module): Many details of locations with specific challenges prepared. Much of setting preplanned by GM. Some details/colour improvised.</li>\n<li>World of Darkness: Almost a prewritten story with particular scenes and story arcs planned out</li>\n</ol>\nBut this is rather shakey - The WoD knowledge is all picked up from people's comments on forums, I think LB is probably not the canonical example of that style of play (but maybe it is?), and D&amp;D can be played in so many different ways I really don't want to use it as an example (a lot of my D&amp;D games have been fairly heavy on improv).<br/><br/>So please correct problems with my existing model, and add in more points to it, if any exist!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416768/#Comment_416768" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-21T05:34:54+00:00" title="June 21, 2013  5:34AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The theory part that is worth thinking about is about play styles.

The beauty (and curse) of story games is that designers have total freedom to make new rules up. There are many. Dogs and AW are Vincent Baker's approach. It is a widely like approach so I mention it as a place to start. <br/><br/>My experience with World games is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQeJ_6yq_wM" rel="nofollow">Dungeon World</a> and in that the GM can improvise wildly as the game is played. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18511/dungeon-world-at-origins#Item_3" rel="nofollow">At Origins last week </a> I ran three sessions and while I had a loose outline of what was in the dungeon I did not have set fronts. My understanding is that these emerge from play. I know some did in my sessions. Part of the improvisation in the game is that the GM asks players what they see/hear/find and uses that as truth - modifying the new monster to fit that truth. So both players and GM are improv-ing.<br/><br/>I've not played Dogs but it is an earlier game so it can give you another take on the ideas. <br/><br/>As to other ways of doing improv games - Fiasco is the next most widely talked about game. You literally make up the scenario in the set up and then improv the scenes. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXJxQ0NbFtk" rel="nofollow">Will Wheaton's Table Top episode</a> to see how it is run.<br/><br/>My games do it in a totally different way from either of these two games. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJAur3pz1s" rel="nofollow">Fairy Tale Assassin League</a> (my new game out this Summer) I use action and scene cards to guide the players though a crazy modern fairy tale blood bath. Each approach is valid and all work. <br/><br/>You can see how they are all different. DW is very much like a traditional RPG in feel (just with rules that don't interrupt the flow of narration). Fiasco is very improv - it helps to be an actor. And Assassin League is fast playing card game (sessions run about an hour) with lots of story telling aids in the form of cards. <br/><br/>I said that this wide openness is a curse. You are now likely not knowing which way to turn first. There are TOO MANY CHOICES. Arrrrg! Brain explodes. I recommend you narrow down on one game at a time, Lady Black Bird for now, and get comfortable playing it. Just know that there is more out there waiting when you are ready.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416779/#Comment_416779" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-21T08:24:11+00:00" title="June 21, 2013  8:24AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>The theory part that is worth thinking about is about play styles.

I've used the exact same "spectrum" metaphor myself (like, as recently as this morning, in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/416656#Comment_416656" rel="nofollow">another thread</a> about hacking Apocalypse World to run Mass Effect). But now that I look at your first and second points, I realize how tricky this is going to get. <br/><br/>Like, Lady Blackbird is very improvisational because all you get is a set of starting characters, a setting, and a general goal (escape! and maybe find this guy!). Apocalypse World, meanwhile, may seem less improvisational in the long run because you've got these countdown clocks ticking away, giving a hint of what's to come \u2013\xa0but the beginning of the first session is about as improvisational as it gets. Until the players show up, you don't know who the characters will be, what their goals or histories are, or even what kind of world they live in. You could show up thinking "Mad Max" and gradually find yourself getting excited to play "Waterworld" (or whatever). You don't even develop fronts until after your first session.<br/><br/>Then you might look at story games that aren't necessarily even roleplaying games, and I'm not even sure where you'd fit them on the spectrum. The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen is basically cooperative (or arguably even competitive) storytelling, where you get to prep not a damn thing for your own story \u2013\xa0the person next to you gives you a prompt (e.g., "Tell us, Baron, about the time you arranged for an ape to be educated at Oxford") \u2013\xa0and any other player can jump in with suggestions and "corrections." I think most people do play it as super improvised, though I've known of people brainstorming the most outlandish story prompts they could think of before even starting play.<br/><br/>Sorry to go all "this question is so BIG!", but I hope it helps more than it hurts!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bobo%20the%20Carpenter" title="Bobo the Carpenter"><img alt="Bobo the Carpenter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bobo%20the%20Carpenter">Bobo the Carpenter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416800/#Comment_416800" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-21T16:10:23+00:00" title="June 21, 2013  4:10PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2013 4:12PM by Bobo the Carpenter.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want a game with very explicit, detailed procedures, in clear words, take a look at Mouse Guard. It is somewhere in the same area as Apocalypse World in many regards (and totally different in many others). Similar, because it tells you exactly how to run this game, and run it well. The book spells out really everything. It requires (and enforces) a very specific style of play. <br/><br/>Where does it fit on your spectrum? Mouse Guard combines prepped GM input and a pre-existing background with the player's input. It's certainly not all improvised, but you cannot railroad it, pre-script it, or even foresee where a session is going to end up. The GM has firm control over the beginning of each session. He gets the ball rolling, and then the players take over and do their thing. Next session, the GM preps a new mission based on the players' interests and their characters' actions, gets the ball rolling, and so on. Thus, restriction and structure in the system lead to, and support, freedom and improvisation in play.<br/><br/>The book is a very good manual teaching you how to be a great Mouse Guard GM and make full use of the full game. And the game is really good, too. I find it a fascinating game; it taught me a lot about roleplaying games. A <i>lot</i>.<br/><br/>One thing that is not so good about Mouse Guard: it's currently out of print and only availabe as a pdf. There is supposed to be a reprint some time before the end of the year, or so the publisher keeps promising. Borrow a physical copy from someone, if you can; the book is beautifully made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416804/#Comment_416804" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-21T19:23:23+00:00" title="June 21, 2013  7:23PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that "improv vs. structured" is definitely more a matter of "how do you run a particular game?"<br/><br/>I will say that the more specific games get, the more closely to one of these types they adhere. The more generic, though, the more you can run it either way. I have absolutely run <i>World of Darkness</i> on the fly; it's actually pretty easy to do. You just have to realize that the game mostly consists of pitting them against opposition that'll tax their Willpower. Then, you learn how to eyeball dice pools correctly (aka 7 dice in a pool represents different power than 3 dice in a pool) and be ready to reference some powers if need be. That's because WoD is the best generic system I've seen, when it comes to running a story.<br/><br/>Something like <i>Burning Empires</i> or <i>Misspent Youth</i> is a much, much more specific game, and it's designed to have a particular framework. You have to set up the opposition to the players in all its glory. Something like <i>Fiasco</i> defies prep work and requires improvisation. That's because it's a very fine-tuned game.<br/><br/>The big, big point that's getting hit here is more important, I think: there's a lot more axes to consider, if you're going to approach storygaming systematically. Personally, I'd just find one with a premise that seems interesting, and jump on in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416810/#Comment_416810" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-22T00:35:21+00:00" title="June 22, 2013 12:35AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you familiar with Montsegur 1244 (or it's more cheerful cousin The Daughters of Verona)?<br/><br/>The game is set up with a pre generated set of characters, and a sequence of fixed acts/segments of the story.  It always starts with a specific scene and it always ends with a specific scene.  And the players play through the game aware of that coming end scene.<br/><br/>For replay value there are more characters than players, and the players can choose to explore the story from other perspectives in subsequent playthroughs.

I have played that game maybe ten times now, and I would be up for playing it again if given the chance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416811/#Comment_416811" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-22T00:56:52+00:00" title="June 22, 2013 12:56AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you all for your comments so far!

The preparation works as a support.<br/><br/>Games that have no pre-planning usually talks about how to play the game (structures of play), while games with pre-planning talks about how to create adventures. Mouse Guard is an exception to this rule ... or is it?<br/><br/>You always need, no matter if it's pre-planned or not, characters with a goal. For GM-less games, all you need to create is the people that the participants play. For GM-controlled games, the opposition can have certain goals. The goal could be a shared one (slay the dragon or find the ruin) or as many goals as characters. If the former, what you need are obstacles to stand in the way to the shared goal. If the latter, the others' goals will collide with each other and create conflicts.<br/><br/>The paragraph above implies that you also need characters. Microscope and A Thousand Years Under the Sun are exceptions to this ... or is it?<br/><br/>Every scene needs an intention. This is something that normally is handled automatically in GM-controlled pre-planned games where the characters have a goal (WoD). The players wants something and the GM frames a scene. What is typical for each scene is that it contains either a decision, an escalation or a revelation.<br/><br/>So what you need to play an improvised game is a structure that makes the participants create characters and goals and each scene should have a clear intention.\n<h3>Some examples</h3>\n<b>InSpectres</b>. You got character generation (workers in an InSpectres firm) and the game generates a common goal (the mission). The structure of play then declares four types of intentions (getting the mission, investigate the abomination, gearing up, field work) that must be followed in the listed order.<br/><br/><b>Kagematsu.</b> The GM creates a ronin and everybody else creates village women - each woman have two things that can bring flavour to the scene framing. All women wants to make the ronin Kagematsu save the village. Each scene, except the ones in the last act, is a different kind of seduction attempt, based on a couple of pre-written intentions that the game gives. The scenes in the last act are instead about if the village is saved or not. The outcome of this depends mostly on the seduction scenes.<br/><br/><b>This Is Pulp</b>. The participant, including the GM, draws and describes two tropes each (persons, events, places) on a map. The players (not the GM) then draws some pre-made characters and talks about how they know each other and, based on the drawn tropes, what their common goal is. Each scene is then created with the intention to overcome a danger, by letting the GM involve the tropes on the map.<br/><br/><b>Archipelago</b>. You all create a world together by drawing things on a map. You then create characters, present them and each participant should then write one goal each other character. The players then choose one goal for their own character that have been written by the others. The participants then takes turns narrating a scene with their own character. I would say that the game doesn't give any intentions for creating scenes, so this is something the group needs to figure out by their own.<br/><br/><b>Zombie Cinema</b>. You all create characters in a world where an outbreak is going to erupt. The game doesn't give any incitements to create goals or give any intentions for scene creation. This is left for the participants to figure out by their own. The game works best, in my experience, if you create character goals that collide and create each scene to either establish information or create a conflict between two characters.<br/><br/><b>Psychodrame</b>. You all choose one situation that happened to a solid group, usually members in a family. During character creation, you intertwine your character with two other characters by choosing aspects that are the opposite of theirs. If one is a criminal then you're a cop, as an example. This creates tension in the group during play, when the characters are trying to protect their aspects (goal). The intention in each scene is either to play out an inner conflict in the character's head, or create or build up to a conflict with another character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416884/#Comment_416884" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T10:13:25+00:00" title="June 23, 2013 10:13AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm kinda surprised to hear that Dogs on the Vineyard is considered improvised.

A Dogs town is significantly less structured.<br/><br/>Here's why: in a dungeon, you typically have paths which include obstacles and enemies that must be overcome. The opposition that the party faces is defined. In a Dogs town, you have a problem that has to be solved (i.e., a tangled mess), but there is no cut-and-dry "this is how you solve it", and it's not clearly defined how they approach the problem. A Dogs town is more of a web than paths; things are related to other things, and the situation changes accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416903/#Comment_416903" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T12:52:55+00:00" title="June 23, 2013 12:52PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So a really interrelated dungeon (say, one that's shaped like a literal web), is improvised, but others are pre-prepared?<br/><br/>I can't think of any dungeon module that I know of that include enemies that <i>must</i> be overcome.

You also need uncertainty to keep up the interest. I've been talking <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17953/curiosity-thrilled-the-cat/p1" rel="nofollow">about this before</a> (read especially about kish\u014dtenketsu), and the constantly reoccurring uncertainty in roleplaying games is sadly the overused die roll.<br/><br/>When reading Keith Johnstone, he brought up that you also need to reconnect to previous things in the story. Don't just stack one thing after another. Make things reappear again, like meeting a known face or suffer a consequence from an earlier action. Kish\u014dtenketsu solves this in another way, where two different things are introduced and then a third thing connects those two earlier ones.\n<blockquote>What I'd like is for people to describe points on this spectrum, with an example of a game that not just supports that mode of play but actually specifically encourages (or insists) on it in the rules.</blockquote>\nSo why have I written all this crap, especially since I'm suffering from a two day hangover? Because I think categorising games in a spectrum of no prep to full prep doesn't give anything. Like I said: you have to do some kind preparation, no matter how you play the game. I would say that the only thing that differs is that if it's only the GM that have to do any preparation, then that person can do that alone before the session.<br/><br/> What's interesting is instead how the prep/setup is made and what kind of game experience that creates, don't you think?<br/>\xd7 How are the players' goal created?<br/>\xd7 How does the goals affect the session?<br/>\xd7 How are intentions for the scenes declared (even if they are implicit)?<br/>\xd7 What kind of uncertainties does the game use?<br/>\xd7 Does the game have anything that make you reconnect to previous happenings?<br/>\xd7 How does the (lack of) prep affect these things?<br/><br/>The last question kind of ties everything together. There are a two more things that are important to make a session successful, but almost no roleplaying games handles that so I wont even mention it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416968/#Comment_416968" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T08:27:06+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  8:27AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>What I'd like is for people to describe points on this spectrum, with an example of a game that not just supports that mode of play but actually specifically encourages (or insists) on it in the rules.</blockquote>\nSo why have I written all this crap, especially since I'm suffering from a two day hangover?

It's not really possible (or useful) to answer "where do things lie on this spectrum of preparation?" It might be more useful to discuss instead "what different kinds of preparation do story games ask of us, and who's expected to do it?" <br/><br/>As I think the discussion above is making clear, there's more than one way to prep even a single game. If you're going to use maps and pre-planned leveled monsters with D&amp;D, it requires a lot of prep by the DM before every session, and only occasional prep by players between sessions (in the form of choosing new spells/feats/etc. when leveling up). That's a different kind of preparation from a D&amp;D game that doesn't use maps or pre-planned encounters, or that uses pre-generated characters with leveling options already selected, or that just follows a written adventure module. They don't fit on a spectrum defined by a single "preparation" variable. <br/><br/>I need to take a closer look at a stack of games to jog my memory for a range of different kinds of prep in story games, but Rickard's varied examples above are a good start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
