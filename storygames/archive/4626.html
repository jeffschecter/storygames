It was meant for characters level 15 and up.<br/><br/>Runes are gathered over time, you use three in a triangle to create your own spells (body/path/effect, figure out the details with the GM). Characters gain XP in a pretty standard way and level up with the standard HP/attack/defense/skill benefits. The combat system is based on dueling, with attack series and turnovers, and a fitting setting where dueling (and fighting big scary things one at a time) is the norm.<br/><br/>So I'm not sure how you could use all this, unless you find an English translation on the net somewhere. I know there are still fans of this discontinued line who publish stuff for it online.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104579/#Comment_104579" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T08:46:58+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  8:46AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since Christian didn't toot his own horn, I will. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> They're more abilities than spells, and Tattoos more than Runes, but this is not too far removed from Beast Hunters.

There are definitely some ideas worth mining there and I may do so, I just want to make certain I've done due diligence before kitbashing a new game.  (I have a very specific audience for this concept.)<br/><br/>Thanks for the suggestions so far.
