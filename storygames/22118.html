<p>So a “no myth” game was originally defined as a game where the game state wasn’t fixed until it entered the shared imagined space.</p><p>That means that “no myth” is a property of the ontology of the game. Something exists if it’s put into play and doesn’t exist if it hasn’t. (“Put into play” can also include things like “OK, before we start, I want to say that this game is about Darth Vader in a shopping mall speaking french so those three things definitely exist”.)</p><p>The GM in a no-myth game can think “I really want to put this blue chair into play, I’m gonna do it to the first normally furnished room the players enter, I feel such a strong attachment to this particular quantum blue chair. It’s gonna get in for sure. Oh blue chair my favorite” The fact that the GM is really into this blue chair does not make the blue chair half myth or the ontological state of the game “half myth”.</p><p>This means, logically, that the phrase “half myth” can’t meaningfully be defined as “some specific offscreen entities are canon, some are not”. <strong>Because that’s already what “no myth” means.</strong></p><p>Instead, for a meaningful definition of “half myth”, how about: “some <em>categories</em> of offscreen entities are canon, some are not.”</p><p>“Hi guys, I’ll run everything in Duckburg fully prepped, but things over in Gooseburg is more ‘no myth’.”</p><p>“Hi guys, everything related to combat is improvised and ran ‘no myth’, I’ll just throw orcs atcha according to my own whim, but I have prepped all the entities and rules regarding the big fashion show in Veluna because I know that that’s the aspect of play that we’re the most invested in. Clothes, designers, audience reactions—all accounted for &amp; implemented. Only with a steady whimsical stream of orc with murderous intent.”</p><p>What does this mean for Burning Wheel? It’s more of a no-myth game innit? There is no category of entities in the game that can be consistently expected to be solid.</p> </div>

                            What about "which myth" then ? as in "this game is fashion-solid with some free-orcs." Or "The game tonight is a solid mystery *I shouldn't even be telling you this* but the carousing is free." "this game has a solid dungeon but the free drama is stronger anyway." That would be more informative, pragmatic. Heck, I would enter a Lacuna game eyes closed with a warning of this kind.  Else, what do you need a word like "no-myth" for ?<br/> </div>

                            In the Forge thread, the idea that there could be a solid off-screen game, state, that very concept was just a "myth" since "everyone knows" that "every bit of gaming is just make-believe". That was the myth he wanted to dispell. Just like how flat-earthers want to dispell the "myth" that the Earth is round.

                            Interestingly in Burning Wheel the players can mechanically probe to find out which things are myth and no-myth... -wise rolls work differently if the GM has hidden information prepped versus doesn't yet know. In the first case they can roll to find stuff out, in the second they can roll to establish stuff.<br/><br/>In all systems players have a way to find out, of course, by watching the GM's face carefully as they ask questions. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>

I was using it as an <b>analogy</b> for explaining why the original no-myth definition as posed by le Joueur already included everything from 1% non-blorb to 99% non-blorb. What he called a "myth" was the very notion that there could be an offscreen gamestate, that there could be a blorb.<br/><br/>I introduced the concept of "full myth" four years ago here on this board as a negation of that concept. The idea of "half-myth" is just confusing!

There's a bigger difference between a game with 0% fudging vs 1% fudging,<br/><br/>than there is between a game with 1% fudging and 99% fudging.<br/>In terms of tension, edge, uncertainty etc.<br/><br/>That's also an analogy I don't want to get into the whole fudging debate.<br/><br/>But there <b>is</b> a difference between a game having an off-screen game-state that's canon, vs a game that does not have that.                        </div>

                            I think this is a major point of misunderstanding here: you seem to equate "non-blorb" with "fudging".<br/><br/>That's often been the case historically, sure, but there is no fundamental reason to equate the two.<br/><br/>I could be entirely anti-blorb *and* entirely anti-fudging.<br/><br/>I can understand taking a "anti-fudging" stance, even categorically. (I do so myself, fairly strictly, for instance.)<br/><br/>I cannot understand or condone a categorical "anti-No Myth" stance (or whatever the opposite of "blorb" might be!). There are games where No Myth might be a bad idea, sure, but there is no reason to take a universal stand again "No Myth", the way a vegetarian takes a stance against eating meat.<br/><br/>(This is in response to your answer to Deliverator, which I feel is more likely to run us off the tracks of this discussion than to add to it. Like, yeah, to a vegetarian, adding a bit of meat to a meal makes it "non-vegetarian", by definition, but this is a part of the analogy which I think isn't helpful in the context of a gaming discussion. So I was trying to point out the flaw in the analogy and get back to talking about games, which I still we can do here. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )                        </div>

I don't think "half-myth" is a very meaningful term, or that it can be defined. I think it was Deliverator's off-hand label for a way to play which can be really fun. (You can tell me if I misread you, Deliverator!)<br/><br/>If I were to talk about roleplaying in this fashion, I would have to only label games as "No Myth" or "Half-Myth", because the hypothetical Full Myth game does not exist (unless we limit our Exploration and the available choices for the players far more than in most RPGs - "Choose Your Own Adventure" books are arguably Full Myth, for example).<br/><br/>In other words, in every game where there is ANY "offscreen content", it is "Half-Myth".<br/><br/>However, what Deliverator was talking about, I think, is a certain type of roleplaying game which has lots of "gaps" in its prep but still retains solid prep <i>for the issues that are pertinent to play</i> (relevant to our creative goals, what we're playing to find out).<br/><br/>I like Sandra's image of "bones of steel in a cloud" for this - it's a great metaphor.<br/><br/>I think that in every game, we achieve success be figuring out <i>what is salient</i>, and then developing some means to lock that in, to make player decisions meaningful. "Locking it in" could mean prior prep, principled improvisation, assigning authorship rights, or reliable procedures (like D&amp;D's random encounters and BW's Circles tests).<br/><br/>I have barely played BW, so I can't speak to that game in particular, but it seems to have the same basic set of tools as other "character-driven games with a traditional GM/player split", so I can't imagine it would be too different from, say, a lot of PbtA games or <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>.<br/><br/>Those feel entirely different in play from "No Myth" play, because there are "bones" in the "cloud" to bounce off.<br/><br/>I think you (Sandra) are confused by this idea because what is <i>salient</i> in these games is different from what is salient in your D&amp;D game. You see a failure to do blorb properly, whereas what is actually happening is people doing exactly the right prep for their desired creative goals.                        </div>

This is my view as well. Sure, you might get the occasional person who refuses to recalibrate their expectations and ends up not enjoying the game, but that can happen with <i>any</i> set of techniques.<br/><br/>I don't particularly care about the terminology, but I do think it's important to distinguish something like BW from, say, PrimeTime Adventures in terms of how prep works. PTA tends to be played in true "story game" fashion, albeit with a GM.                        </div>

Hi <a href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">@yukamichi</a> ♥<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485116/#Comment_485116" rel="nofollow">Please read this li'l story</a>.<br/><br/>In that analogy, the no-myth claim is like saying "since you <i>could</i> just rattle off a random letter and number without connecting it to a board, then there musn't be a board in the first place".

The "no myth" claim is, even the blorbiest of blorby games, when there eventually is a prep lacuna, which according to no-myth philosophy there always will be, will be played no myth or will be evidence that there is no myth.<br/><br/><a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=6275.msg64705#msg64705" rel="nofollow">Here:</a>

Ok! This is great. I think it gets to the bottom of the issue.<br/><br/>You are saying: "look how much better play is when you have rules and metarules for how to introduce elements! Here are my rules and metarules and they are so great!"<br/><br/>And we are all, like, "Hell yeah! Those are awesome!" [And, of course, you're presenting them in a different - and, I would argue, better - way, but they're rules and metarules that lots of people and play traditions have used before. But I'll just call them "yours" as a shorthand for now.]<br/><br/>But then you seem to go from there all the way to, "If you're doing something similar but different, you need to reconsider, or you'll have no fun at all, like I did for a long time! It was awful, I tell ya. Because operating without those rules and metarules makes the game lose all sense of tangibility and it doesn't seem 'solid' anymore."<br/><br/>And we respond, "Yes, that feeling of solidity is pretty cool. Some games accept that nothing feels solid and that's ok, as you say - hippie games - and others have those rules you mention. But those aren't the only options. There's a <i>whole other</i> category, too, of games that operate on <i>similar but different rules and metarules</i>. And, because there <i>are</i> rules and metarules in operation, just like in the style you're describing, the games do feel tangible and 'solid' and are fun in a similar way."<br/><br/>But you are sticking to, "No! It's either my rules/metarules or <i>no rules at all</i>! Those are the only two options! A game which hybridizes in any way threatens me, because what if people get it wrong? Yuck."<br/><br/>And that's totally fine to state as a personal preference, but if you're going to make it into a statement of fact, you're going to annoy people, just like any other way of making something people are enjoying sound like a categorically bad thing.<br/><br/>Otherwise, you need to show fairly specifically how and why doing a hybrid is going to lead to <i>a specific and recognizable problem</i>. If you do that, then people playing that way (which is a lot of people just now!) can go play and then notice that same problem and understand what you were saying (and change how they play and potentially join your crusade <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ).                        </div>

<blockquote>Does BW in practice and at the table use [information separation, each player character is only being run by one player each, identifying stance and GM plays world] in a vanilla way? If not, it’s excluded from my requirement to be blorb and gets off the hook that way.</blockquote>
Mostly yes. Maybe some slight differences, like introducing facts via -wises or the presence of persons via Circles.
<blockquote>Is BW in practice and at the table unblorby, i.e. injects entities in a non-gloracular way? It can get off the hook if there’s no like “quantum bears” (i.e. if I am misreading Twilight in the Duchy Verdorben p 14) or whatever, if things are introduced just like in any OSR game, through the map key or encounter tables. Speaking specifically about the GM-introduced entities here.</blockquote>
Definitely unblorby. Very much so. Can be played blorby, e.g. Burning THAC0, but generally it's perfectly good practice for a GM to figure out a bunch of elements that can challenge player character beliefs and some will be blorb-like and some will be ready to introduce as a failure consequence whenever it makes sense.
<blockquote>Games that do use them should be blorby.</blockquote>
And the reason I think it works in BW is because the map includes belief-space. A player may in fact predictably <i>change</i> blorb-space in BW simply by writing a belief which is not challenged by what everyone knows is the status quo. That's part of BW physics. (they won't know <i>what</i> they're changing or how it will change, only <i>that</i> it will change).                        </div>

I have been writing about them for years. I haven't seen them anywhere else. The OSR blogs taught me map keys and random tables, but that's just one specific set of  "generative tools". Arranging the three kinds of truth sources (prepped facts, generative rules, lacuna safety net) as fallback tiers is my own invention, as is the zen-derived process of patching the hole, forgiving yourself, trying again. Anyone who wants to dispute this has the burden of proof on them. Dig up prior art or stfu.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> that sounds harsh but we are talking about the thing that I am proudest of in my entire life. And I've done a lot of weird shit; worked for the UN, wrote a novel, made friends with my game design idol, been in a rock band, gotten kissed at a museum, wrote sestinas, gone through therapy, led a meditation class, coped with disease… and then I look back at my life and I'm like "just wow those three tiers of truth that was pretty great!"                        </div>

Yeah, we're on the same page here. I think that if you mean "blorby" is a question of how solid and committed to prep things are, they are definitely less "blorby" than your games. (For example, you'd rarely use or need random tables in AW; they wouldn't make the game better except in rare cases where the MC doesn't have ANY good ideas and neither do the players.) However, if it's a question of following principles of saliency and making things up in a principled fashion, then it's a good match.

Yes! I love this. <br/><br/>I think that *exploring* how more or less "blorb" might change, improve, or weaken games in that "half-Myth" area is tremendously fruitful.<br/><br/>I'd love to see how you apply your tiers and pillars and techniques to this kind of analysis! That would be *super* interesting.                        </div>

Like, just imagine how much easier to understand, and clearer written, Burning Empires and Burning Wheel with the Adventure Burner could be if they had some awareness of this idea of being clear about what rules govern injection of entities into the SIS.

You're right—it's a codification of their unverbalized practice. That's good to remember. Even though I think codifying it was vital for me to grok it. OK maybe I should do some more weird shit in my life to be proud of. Time to make a new bucket list I guess!<br/><br/> </div>

Oh, jeez, and you know what... <i>not</i> knowing that is a good way to ruin the game. I had a friend who was like, "I like the Fight! mechanics. Our game should have more fights." And I replied, "Well, write more fighty Beliefs then." And she was like, "But that's not what my character would dooooooo..." <b>*maximum facepalm*</b><br/><br/>I think the GM and I could have done a better job, perhaps, of making it as explicit as the text does that Beliefs are about player priorities. But mostly I do lay this failure at the feet of the player, because she just wasn't able to listen to that at that time.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, in terms of the three tiers, here is how BW works:<br/><br/>1) Prepped stuff: prep things that are either directly related to challenging the PCs' Beliefs, or to the GM's Big Thing, but not much else. Drawing a reasonably-detailed map of an area the PCs are traveling through is fine. (I have done this and it was helpful.)<br/><br/>Anything you prep like that, you definitely need to stick to.<br/><br/>2) Gloracle: What Gloracle there is, is entirely player-facing, actually. Guy is a bit too dismissive, in my opinion, of just how hippy-<i>ish</i> (w/o being fully hippy, obviously) BW really is. (Not only is there entirely transparent, player-facing methods for authoring <i>some</i> setting facts, but you also have explicit GM-stakes setting, and even stakes negotiation in many cases. Stakes-setting is somewhat un-blorb, right?)<br/><br/>(You can also use system-neutral gloracle stuff like name lists for, you know, a random Dwarf the PCs meet. XGtE strikes again!)<br/><br/>3) Stuff the GM makes up on the spot using the principle of saliency: yes, there is a fair amount of this. But there are very solid meta-rules in play around how this aspect works:<br/><br/>-Don't introduce anything contradictory to what came before, in terms of facts<br/>-What you introduce should fit with the tone and genre boundaries established in Session Zero and up til now<br/>-As much as possible, what you introduce should pose awkward choices for one or more PCs and their Beliefs. I want to expound on this one, because it's not as hard as it sounds. What you're really doing is having the PCs already in the middle of doing something to pursue one of the Beliefs, and then they fail a roll or something. So usually it will be fairly obvious what would be a reasonable consequence that makes pursuing that Belief harder. And remember, if the GM can't think of any interesting consequences, then there <i>can't</i>, by the rules, be a roll.                        </div>

I like it.<br/><br/>I'm not so sure about explicit stake-setting. It's un-blorb in that it's not based on prep, but it's highly blorb in that it's an objective resolution technique that creates emergent narrative and can't be used to, say, hide railroading. I would consider it quite "gloracular", myself - and more "blorb" than not.<br/><br/>I think that such explicit resolution techniques are pretty close to the "blorby" end of the spectrum, even though they look quite different on the surface from traditional resolution mechanics (in that they differ from the in precisely the ways that make them good for emergent narrative/story/gameplay and lending validity to player decisions).                        </div>

                            I'm putting in a quote from the other thread in order to consolidate:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think <i>Burning Wheel</i> is far closer to a blorb game than a hippie game, by your criteria (and most people's). If you make it less "traditional", that will make it less appealing to a lot of the game's fans.</p></div></blockquote>
See, the first sentence here I think is nonsense, while the second sentence is pretty much spot on. <br/><br/>Let me unpack that: BW is <i>suuuuuuuuuper</i> hippified in many respects. Not all of them—it has pretty traditional-ish crunchy rules for simulating the medieval / fantasy world, casting spells, injuries, weapons, and so on. But it has some really huge—and ongoing—non-trad techniques at play as well. <br/><br/>Not only does it have Circles, Wises, and other knowledge skills. <br/><br/>Not only does it have the players constantly telling the GM how to prep by evolving their Beliefs.<br/><br/>It also <i>doesn't break</i> if you start, for example, breaking character monogamy. Sometimes you do, in fact, play someone else's relationship character if your character isn't around but you don't want to sit out. This isn't 100% supported by the rules-text, but it's not... like, a huge problem if you do this sometimes.<br/><br/>I'd also argue that it has <i>radical</i> transparency of method relative to most traditional games.<br/><br/>BUT! You're <i>right</i> that much of the appeal of BW is in those very hard-coded rules: the detailed tactical combat, the strategy of how character advancement works, and so on. OTOH, lighter games that use the BW engine do exist and are great.
<blockquote>You're right that it asks you to "switch stances" sometimes, in limited and circumscribed areas. So do PbtA games.<br/><br/>Some people are bothered by this. Some people aren't bothered by it at all - they love it! Still others are a bit bothered, but they accept it because they like the effects on play, and that's a worthwhile tradeoff for them.</blockquote>
Yeah, I think the "are you bothered by needing to change stance?" question may be at the root of a lot of the disagreements / misunderstandings in this thread. BW is probably not a good game to be a PC in if you can't comfortable switch stances! Note, though, that this is much more of a "veteran gamer" problem than a "new player" problem. I've had great success running BW for people who'd never roleplayed before. They had no expectations to disrupt, and we left out the detailed subsystems (something specifically recommended by the text), and it was fine.                        </div>

I have been trying to avoid using the word since it is (intentionally?) very unclear. <a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a> suggested 'Klockwerk' as an alternative, which I like.  Here's my sense of what we're talking about (which <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> is calling blorb):<br/>-Games where as much as possible (location details, adversity, stakes, etc) is prepped in detail ahead of time.<br/>-What can't be prepped (or wasn't) is decided by an totally transparent fortune system (random tables etc).<br/>-System that alter the game state dynamically (time, inventory, resources, hunger, etc) are tracked transparently and consistently.<br/>-Players have a single character, and their input into the game is limited to the plausible actions of that character, questions about the perceptions of that character, and manipulation of the games systems (buying/selling, following consistent combat resolution rules.<br/><br/>The above add up (to me) to a feeling like the game is running largely on its own logic, to which GM and player alike are bound.  That's why I like the term Klockwerk: this is a style where the cogs move on their own (as much as possible) and the players adapt.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Matt,<br/><br/>I can see the "BW is not very traditional!" angle. It's certainly got lots of interesting technology in it! And those bits and pieces have a major impact on gameplay.<br/><br/>However, I also think that it's closer to a traditional game than a "hippie game", because Sandra has been talking about "hippie games" as ones that don't have a GM or traditional resolution mechanics (e.g. Fiasco). BW seems more like something like Sorcerer or The Shadow of Yesterday to me, on the spectrum of traditional-hippie: it's got some stuff in it, yeah, but it's still fundamentally "you are the GM and I play my character who has stats and abilities and stuff, and we roll to see how well I do". <br/><br/>Your comments about character non-monogamy surprised me. Is there anything about BW that makes it more or less amenable to character non-monogamy than in other "GM + players" RPG? Nothing comes to mind for me, but I don't know all the ins and outs of the game all that well (especially compared to someone with in-depth knowledge, like yourself).                        </div>

                            BW is definitely a "relationship sandbox," at least normally. So sometimes it's helpful to have NPCs in the relationship-map personified, and sometimes more than one at a time in the same scene.<br/><br/>BW also has the benefit of it being very easy to determine NPCs' stats on the fly and in a world-consistent way. In some respects, this may be one of its blorbiest aspects. But it means that if you're playing a character who isn't your PC, and you need to make a roll, it's really easy to figure out the dice pool, generally speaking.<br/><br/>BTW, Luke might be horrified at me and my friends playing around with character non-monogamy like that! In Burning Empires you can definitely play your character's second-in-command in scenes, that's RAW; we're just taking that principle a little further.<br/><br/>As for the broader question of where BW falls on the spectrum of hippie ---- traditional, well, let me add this:<br/><br/>It is in fact possible to play BW without a GM. Jonathan White and I created a hack of it called Burning Kingdoms, layering the Burning Empires faction / disposition rules onto the usual fantasy BW. Each player controls an entire faction in the gameworld: a leader, their 2iC, military units, etc.<br/><br/>I've played in two almost-complete campaigns of it. One had four factions, the other had three. Both fell apart for (very different!) social reasons, but the gameplay was fabulous. Some of the most fun I've had roleplaying.                        </div>

<blockquote>Guy is a bit too dismissive, in my opinion, of just how hippy-ish (w/o being fully hippy, obviously) BW really is. (Not only is there entirely transparent, player-facing methods for authoring some setting facts, but you also have explicit GM-stakes setting, and even stakes negotiation in many cases. Stakes-setting is somewhat un-blorb, right?)</blockquote>
GM failure resolution can be fairly un-blorb, yeah. The way I do it is:<br/>* what are several reasonable (from in-world facts/physics) ways this situation could go wrong?<br/>* which of those challenges BITs?<br/>* pick one arbitrarily<br/>* or if none remain, make up something less reasonable<br/><br/>So mine is "try to generate blorby outcomes then constrain by BITs" but you could do "generate BITful outcomes then constrain by blorb" but I don't like the second approach.<br/><br/>In general a roll resolves a larger swathe of stuff-that's-actually-interesting than would be possible to be fully gloracular (blorby) for.                        </div>

                            Setting stakes is the same as the OSR process of rulings: Game master/referee, or sometimes a player, suggests possible outcomes and a way of selecting one of them by using the rules framework at hand.<br/><br/>You are trying to find a particular mushroom in the forest, because the hallucinogens are good for summoning fey. In Burning wheel, the game master assigns a skill and a difficulty for the roll and tells what happens on a failure. In OSR, the referee does the same decisions, might or might not announce what he has decided (there is table variation and this also depends on the circumstances - is a character's life on on balance, is there the possibility of finding wrong mushrooms, etc.).                        </div>

Oh totally, anything that allows or requires the GM to manipulate the situation toward their desired result is out-of-bounds.  That means no preplanned-events, railroading, nudging of players, fudging of random results, or hard-framing (skipping over potential decision points to reach a more dramatic moment).  If the GM can move the gears arbitrarily, it's not Klockwerk.                        </div>

Sandra, I’m trying to follow your train of thought here, to see if I can get to what is the essential issue for you. So by “blorb” you essentially mean: rules and prep which determine what happens in story in a way that is transparent and that are impartial and don’t lend themselves to being able to being changed upon the GMs whim. There are procedures, and there has been planning, so that things don’t just happen willy-nilly or by GM fiat, so they stay tangible, impartial, transparent, etc. <br/><br/>So does this basically come down to the relationship between the GM and the PCs and creating a solid space in which the fiction is based on impartial and non-subjective  systems. So that the player’s feel that their choices matter; that there is a there, there; and that they haven’t been treated unfairly or arbitrarily by the GM?<br/><br/> </div>

Ok, I think we should talk about the essence of your argument, because I think people are getting sidelined in semantics. So, I’m going to try to frame your argument, and the reason you feel the way you do. I would say your argument is something like the following:<br/><br/>Players who are playing to identify with their <br/>characters are treating the world their characters experience and are interacting with as solid and real and reliable; they want their character’s to interact with that world and that world to react in an impartial manner and not feel cheated by the GM or feel like their experience of its tangibly is illusionary. Players are identified with these characters in these types of games, that is why they play games which have these features, and if their interactions don’t feel solid, non-arbitrary, and fair it takes them out of that identity-stance and it becomes about whether or not the GM was fair or made the right choice. <br/> </div>

                            Right, and not to get into another semantics nitpick, but the "feel" part in the way you wrote it ("feel solid") can open players up to get illusionismed and that's not really what I want; trees need to fall down even if no-one is in the forest to hear it, is what I'm saying. ♥                        </div>

                            I think technically from a player perspective "feel solid" is exactly right, but practically if you target "feel" rather than trees actually falling down, a misstep ruins future trust and your "clever" targeting of "they just need to <i>feel</i> that way" will ruin your future "okay trees actually fall, <i>promise</i>".                        </div>

Ok! This is interesting.<br/><br/>Let’s dig a little deeper.<br/><br/>First, why would that be a big turnoff for you? I know you’re not against non-Klockwerk play in general, and you wouldn’t have the wrong expectations (because we’re having the conversation now), so what is the source of the turnoff?<br/><br/>Second, what about the game suggests the opposite to you?

I think the reason I've been successful at semi-prepped play is because people generally trust me on the fairness issue. Both in terms of rules application, and when it comes to making aesthetic judgments about what would be interesting to add to the already-prepped stuff.<br/><br/>Now, I'm trying to think about what it would be like to play in a game where there's solid blorby prep but the GM wasn't very fair. Y'know, I actually think about a month or two ago I had just such an experience.<br/><br/>There weren't really random encounters, but the GM clearly had a good sense of which monsters were where, and there was even some amount of reactivity to that setup. However, he didn't know the rules <i>at all</i> (this was nominally AD&amp;D1E, and the guy didn't even know how THAC0 worked), and thus was very inconsistent in adjudicating action resolution, making sure that character abilities worked consistently, and so on. In short, there was the spine of a good adventure there: it was pretty basic, but there was nothing wrong with his prep. But he had that "GM is god, rules don't matter" attitude, and thus the game sucked. I actually rage-quit after a particularly bad moment of non-transparency and arbitrariness in application of system. (I <i>should</i> have rage-quit at a much earlier moment, when he had us roll saving throws to not piss our pants, which was much more obviously humiliating and rage-quitting would have been more justified.)                        </div>

                            Ah, well, that's pretty simple, then. Games like AW are specifically for people who want to play out a story about sexy guys in jeans in the post apocalypse, while expressing themselves aesthetically, <i>and do it from a first-person character perspective</i>.<br/><br/>Consider, for instance, that as a Hardholder, you're going to be facing "hunger" (or whatever other problem) in your hardhold because the dice said so, on a regular basis. If you go and solve the problem that's causing the hunger, a new one will just pop up the next time you roll badly (but note that <i>you</i> are the one choosing "hunger" when that happens, unless it's a full miss).<br/><br/>There's no "blorb" there. Rather, the game says that, hey, this is the kind of problem that comes up regularly in your hardhold. And the player says, "Yeah, that's what I want to spend my time playing out!"<br/><br/>In other words, Vincent decided that the player's desire to "play a Hardholder dealing with hunger problems in her hardhold" is the thing we want, and we can get it far more easily this way than by going through all the hassle of thorough prep, gloracular outcomes, and so forth (and that could still fail to happen, even despite all that work). Instead, we have a game structure where you get your wish - of playing the hardholder dealing with hunger problems among her population - in an easier and more reliable way. <br/><br/>If you require your gaming to always have "full blorb", then you're definitionally excluding most of these games: most/all PbtA games, Burning Wheel, The Shadow of Yesterday, Sorcerer, My Life with Master, etc, etc, etc - basically anything that's not director stance story gaming or OSR-style "explore the dungeon" play. <br/><br/>I think the key is that people want to <i>participate</i> in a cool story, but their Technical Agenda is to do so purely through the lens of their character. (Kind of like how you want to win, yes, but you want to win <i>as [Character X],</i> with all that implies.)<br/><br/>Lots of tools in the game keep this from turning into that kind of "90s play" you're complaining about, starting with MC principles and agenda and so forth (they're explicit and overt, so players can and will and should call out an MC who doesn't follow them), to rules that create these dynamics (like the rule which tells you when the people are hungry, the instructions to make everything a threat, the rules for spending barter or going hungry yourself, and so on), to rules which create consistent and reliable resolutions when your character applies their pressure to these situations. All of that creates reliably emergent, unpredictable fiction which satisfies all of that criteria, at least when you play it right (I don't think AW is as bulletproof as some people think, but the play culture has really caught on and become a thing that works great for people).<br/><br/>In other words, in a 90s style game, you're at the mercy of the GM. In these games, your choices (of Beliefs, of playbooks, of moves, etc) "set the table" for the kinds of conflicts and situations you want to play out and be involved in, instead. The GM can't force them on you (not without breaking Principles, anyway). And then the way the Agenda, Principles, and moves work together gives us emergent, unpredictable outcomes which are exciting for everyone involved. If you want to go shoot some guy or sleep with some guy, the rules guarantee you the possibility of success, and the MC's prep sets interesting stakes for when you fail. It's not at all like klokwerk but it has its own gloracle-like process, which creates unexpected and new material at the same (or higher) level of unpredictability. We've all committed to these processes and following them faithfully, just like how the klokwerk GM and players commit to certain principles, and that's what makes the game great (and completely different from a 90s style game).<br/><br/>But the ability of all the participants to make decisions along the way is basically what makes it fun, artistically. You get to say, "I want to play a hardholder, and my holding has problems with raiders and a water shortage", because that excites you. You don't, instead, roll a bunch of random situations and see if you like them after the fact.<br/><br/>Does that get you any closer to understanding half-Myth play?                        </div>

                            I admit I prefer them with klokwerk. But light as a "no paper after seeing rock" rule. It's "fairness", as <a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">@Jeff_Slater</a> made me see. You don't need a map of all moral choices. A good compass and some landfeatures do well enough. <br/>From the other angle : so many things can go wrong before that (introducing diegetic elements).

Are we talking about the same game!??! It's not at all clear to the players to what extent the MC is following the principles and agenda.<br/><br/></div></blockquote>
To a large extent, I know what you mean. It’s very trad-adjacent. I’ve also played a game of AW that felt just like a trad game (and I didn’t like it).<br/><br/>But all the “machinery” is out in the open (except for fronts/threats, but I really don’t think they’re that central to the game), so when you get the proper culture of play, it starts to be very obvious when someone’s not doing the things they’re supposed to be doing. AW is not “robust” in this sense, but it can get there when the players are committed to following its principles (just like how a 2097e GM could totally fudge stuff and cheat, but what makes the game good is when she doesn’t).<br/><br/>If you consider how much playbook choices and move results screw with any kind of planned storyline, though, you’ll see that it’s a far cry from 90s play. The players just have so much agency of the shape the game takes, from the first session to long-term developments like deciding that you have followers and that you have psychic powers now and that NPC now has to do what you want and that one is dead and that one is an ally...<br/><br/>Try to run a typical “adventure module” with AW and you’ll find it basically impossible.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Like the moves are misdirected right? And you don't speak its name? There are plenty of design features in that are meant to make the moves, principle and agenda to disappear from the view of the player. And that in and of itself isn't a problem. I like that kind of design, lawsian&amp;finchian social interaction rules work on a similar principle                        </div>

                            Anyway, yes, AW and its relatives feel meaningful, or fail to, depending upon how much the GM adheres to the Agenda and Principles. This is 100% true. I'd say it's also true for BW, and most of the other things we're talking about in this thread.<br/><br/>When I first played AW in the summer of 2010, Bret Gillan (the Final Girl guy) was running it, but I bought the book and had read it. It was, in fact, really obvious that he grokked the principles and GM agenda. It felt pretty transparent to me, since I'd bothered to read the book.<br/><br/>Actually, I was just talking with <a href="/forums/profile/StoneTharp">@StoneTharp</a> about something in relation to this thread: how much does the traditional role of the GM as also being the one who teaches the rules factor into everything we're discussing? Personally, I think it's a huge factor. There are so many games that fall into either illusionism or participationism, even if the GM doesn't particularly want that, because the GM is the only one who knows the rules. There's no culture of the PCs pushing back on the GM creatively or mechanically.                        </div>

This is the moment where I look at the GM (or another player) and just decide they’re lame and bad. Nothing to do with the system, they just can’t produce good fiction.<br/><br/>Or more kindly, we talk it over and see whether they were happy and if they were, we might just like different stuff. <br/><br/>Or sometimes. Following the system doesn't get us fiction that we both find enjoyable.                        </div>

                            I'll get back to blorb in a moment. Just to fill out my view.<br/><br/>Someone can produce fiction I don’t like even if we’re all contributing whatever we want. This could be because…<br/><br/>We generally have aesthetic disagreement (whether in general or about this one specific thing)<br/><br/>They’re having a bad day (normally they’re good but today they were off)<br/><br/>They haven’t thought about what makes good fiction, so they end up producing fiction even they don’t like (I used to do this when writing before I read screenwriting books)<br/><br/>I think Apocalypse World and MonsterHearts (I have more experience with the latter) are fiction producing games. The GM and Players are asked to produce fiction and that necessitates an act of aesthetic judgement.                        </div>

                            I like that breakdown, Sandra. I agree with you completely!<br/><br/>It’s hard for me to imagine how AW would run for someone not familiar with the fiction-creating concepts of, say, Narrativist (Egrian) theory. When I play the game, I apply those ideas in practice, and we get great results. But I agree that AW’s principles and methods aren’t all the way there, not yet. (Dogs in the Vineyard seems much more consistent and clear in this regard to me.)<br/><br/>Then again, so many people are playing and having a great time. <br/><br/>We could definitely do better, but I don’t think anyone knows how to just yet. I look forward to seeing what comes next!                        </div>

I think this is very true.  It can be hard to make certain stakes meaningful in non-blorb play.  If you break your lantern in Dungeon World, does it matter?  It's on the GM to describe the tenuous situation it puts you in sufficiently for you to buy it.  Is there an NPC you care about that is afraid of the dark or a monster who can take advantage of this situation?  The problem itself doesn't matter much, so it needs to put pressure on character conflict or put something more tangible (like Hit Points) in peril.<br/><br/>In blorb play, the systems around time and light are tangible enough that you can have logistical stakes, in addition to lethal or character stakes.<br/> </div>

                            So our reg Tomb of A sesh was canceled today (b/c a pretty serious reason <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/>)<br/><br/>so we started a new campaign In Search of the Unknown (in our old Keep on the Borderland continuity; but also we ripped it from Mystara where we had been playing it back to Forgotten Realms because I just want it all to be on the same big world) and at the end when they were leaving their second expedition (they did two expeditions in the same sessions; they wanted to go back to the Keep to rest up. Btw Paul your hp spend system SO AWESOME. We're getting way better at it. It was even more fun with fewer people I think, and with monks! monks the best class! hadouken!!!).<br/><br/>Anyway I rolled up two random barbarian warriors and when they saw that one of the PCs had a pretty legendary shield [well we got a lot done ok? we played all day] from the warrior Rogahn, they started talking. I accidentally wallpaper-layered their entire backstory. It was awesome. I loved them, there was a guy (Harg) and a girl (Lo). The girl's husband was dead. The three of them were generals from the barbarian army; sole survivors. She was quiet but she occasionally spat in the snow [yes KotB in the wintertime!] as Harg tried to convince the PCs to help them kill everyone in the Keep.<br/><br/>SMH at my self and all my blorby dreams yet getting really into the extreme amount of wallpaper layer stuff needed to make these super old basic modules work. I mean, all stats &amp; stuff is solid af; the amount and stats of the barbarian was wholly gloracular, and so was the coins &amp; stuff the PCs had found earlier inside of the Quasqueton etc etc. All on the level but still… <br/><br/>It's weird, I felt <i>more</i> bad for a secret door that I had to improvise how it was disguised, I said that the wall was covered in tar (I figured they might scrape the tar off and find the door) but then the tar ended up becoming super salient and so I had accidentally injected an element into the diegesis. That started as wallpaper. But that's the procedure right now, it's just what it is, until our newly discovered design space comes up with a better procedure for moderating entity injections.<br/><br/>Whereas Harg and Lo I just fell in love with them♥                        </div>

                            OSR types talk about "player skill" a lot. I think a portion of that skill is often digging beyond the prep: keep gathering information about the environment until the GM is forced to start going off-book and making stuff up.<br/><br/>'Cause that's when the GM start adding details that they think are wallpaper at first (the tar, the Barbarians' backgrounds), but a clever player can turn useful and salient.<br/><br/>The more stuff you make the GM make up on the spot, the more chances to score some kinda leverage or advantage!                        </div>

                            Because the tar wasn't really "there". It's clever when you use a mirror or something that is really part of the game.

There’s a definitely a line in there somewhere that can be crossed, but for my tastes the tar is a gaming success, not a failure. I’m not sure there’s a functional way to play without that... not one that doesn’t turn an RPG into a board game, anyway.                         </div>

                            I’m saying (and I’m aware this is subjective/personal):<br/><br/>1. A game where you didn’t allow yourself to make up the tar thing would probably be LESS fun. Potentially significantly so.<br/><br/>2. I see nothing unhygienic about the tar (unlike the steam dragon). It enables creativity and cleverness and interesting decisions that, I feel, are entirely legitimate.<br/><br/>In other words, it’s not breaking the Paper before Rock principle and it’s adding a lot to gameplay. <br/><br/>3. I’d have to be convinced that it’s even possible to remove such improvisation from the game in the first place, without making it into a poor reflection of what the game could be.                        </div>

                            It's according to my stated principles (three tiers + wallpaper), so it's kosher. But. I'm not <i>happy</i> about it. It's not the most satisfying parts of the game, in fact, it's an <i>un</i>satisfying part of the game.                        </div>

                            I really really enjoyed all the wallpaper; there's a lot more wallpaper improvisation in this module than there is in the Tomb of A.<br/>I improvised many books and types of stone and all kinds of fun things.<br/><br/>I expected them to just scrape it off and find the door. Now they have tar and they might cook up a use for it. [They haven't even <i>done</i> that yet and I'm still worried <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/>] It's fine. This stuff happens. It's just not my favorite thing.                        </div>

                            It's super unwieldy but you could always have at least two options of wallpaper (think of two things it could be) and roll a dice to seen which one it is.<br/><br/>1-3=tar<br/>4-6=vines or something                        </div>

                            There are random motivation and mannerism generators on the internet. <br/>What does it mean to take a location from Mystara to Forgotten Realms ? Does it change the ecology of the place or does it just mean you paste a map bit on a bigger map ?<br/> </div>

The biggest thing is that the gods &amp; kings &amp; such are different. Which means I don't have to study a new setting book which to me is the boringest part of all RPG.                        </div>
