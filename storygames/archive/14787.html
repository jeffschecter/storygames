That more or less goes for online and face to face.<br/><br/>For online chat, I'm probably more likely to say "indie games" because in the internet it's generally a topical discussion and Indie-ness is sometimes relevant.<br/><br/>For in face to face chat, discussing games is usually more about, you know, playing games, possibly as an immediate course of action, as in "would you like to play a game with me tonight/this week/sometime soon?" So Indie-ness stays out of the conversation unless someone asks. Even if they ask "what kind of games?" I'll stick to  descriptors that are game-specific, like "a post-apocalyptic game that's about badass people having messy relationships, kind of like Firefly mixed with mad Max." Or "a three player game about a troubled adolescent making a faerie journey, where one player plays the heroine and the other two play the Light and Dark Faeries, and we see how everyone grows and changes by the end. It plays in a couple hours." I do talk about how games are distinct, and how they might be different from the way the hearer is used to, but I try to avoid  highlighting difference. Just describe each game on its own terms, and mention GMlessness, etc like it ain't no thing.<br/><br/>If we're talking about publishing, we'll get into Indie territory, but i'll usually say something like "I made my own game, and I print and sell the books myself." or "I've got a lot of friends in town who also publish their own roleplaying games, and we get together to talk about new ideas and play with each other."<br/><br/>In person, especially, I just lead with "hey let's play a game" and move on to "hey here's a game that I/my friend made" and an understanding of Indie-ness and the Indie scene just develops naturally.<br/><br/>EDIT: I talk to one of my brothers (and longtime gaming buddy) about Indie stuff; he's skeptical of a lot of design ideas but enjoys some of the actual games (Vincent baker games are generally solid with him). I tend to avoid topics of design that i know will be contentious. My other brother is even more argumentative then us so I haven't really talked about games froma design standpoint at all, devaulting back to "play games, then talk" methodology. I played Capes with him and he liked it. I talk with non-gamers pretty frequently about self-publishing, which is easy to do cuz it's no different than "I draw comics" or "I made a zine" or "my friends and I are in a band, we did a couple shows around town." Portland is a particularly friendly environment for DIY art. With gamer friends I lead in more gently, but I don't hide it either. In the end I've found that, contrary to some forum environments, my actual gaming friends don't draw hard lines between different types of games. Any given game is what it is, and they may like it or they may not.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336307/#Comment_336307" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-28T17:27:12+00:00" title="July 28, 2011  5:27PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Talk?

I talk to pretty much any and all of my role playing friends about them and occasionally get them to try those games out (though, granted, it's an uphill battle to get it done as the furthest I can usually push folks outside the D&amp;D &amp; World o' Darkness zones is to try Savage Worlds, and even that takes some doing).<br/><br/>Out of the many friends I have who game, only two of them ever bring up indie game titles in conversation of their own volition. With everyone else I usually have to initiate the conversation.<br/><br/>Online I talk about "indie" game titles with friends I've made through podcasting and forum-ing and that's usually a pretty even mix as far as contributions to the various conversations go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336335/#Comment_336335" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-28T23:54:22+00:00" title="July 28, 2011 11:54PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2011 11:58PM by Wilhelm.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I shout my opinions to the world at my blog, <a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/gaming-posts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wilper.wordpress.com/gaming-posts</a> .

However, everyone has niched into their own narrow fields of preference and the discussions are rarely fruitful.<br/><br/>Real discussion happens at cons (I haven't been in a regular group for a few years), after we have played a game we go back and discuss it.

I'm not sure what the split there is; I talk more to my friends, but there are more random internet yahoos specifically interested in talking about games, so maybe it works out to being about the same?  I do know that my conversations with friends are more focused, in the sense that we talk about <i>our game</i> (what we want to play next, how our current game is going, what we could try to do better, etc.), while internet discussion tends to be less so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336365/#Comment_336365" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-29T08:54:06+00:00" title="July 29, 2011  8:54AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I end up talking about indie games a lot, 'cause people will ask what i like to do, or just what i do, and games (playing, designing) comes up pretty quickly.<br/>And it's the kind of thing that i'll often get that verbal "click through the link" response, you know, not like "Oh, you like fishing, sweet.

The shops closest to me don't carry indie games. They don't sell as well as GW miniatures and collectible games (though the collectibles craze has waned, obviously) and the folks at the store don't have any particular interest in them. Their interest in semi-unusual stuff lies more in board and card games, so they cover those reasonably well.<br/><br/>In person, the closest I get to talking indie games the vast majority of the time is talking larp. I include in my definition of indie roleplaying all of the non-franchised larp systems or pay-published larp rulesets (so I exclude WoD, the 2 NEROs, IFGS, Cthulhu Live, and a couple others). I participate in a reasonably large community of such games, so there's a lot of in-person talking about them, though most of the conversations are very specific to the events at hand.<br/><br/>I'm running a tabletop game for some friends. We're using a mashup of rules from Smallville, Leverage, and Savage Worlds. The players who are used to tabletop RPGs only know D&amp;D and WoD, so this is a big stretch for them. And my 9 year old son is part of the group and he loves tactical combat stuff, so the possibilities for full on indie game play are a bit limited at this point. But as he grows, we'll keep evolving. And I'll keep evolving too. I have some chops to build as a GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336370/#Comment_336370" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-29T09:17:09+00:00" title="July 29, 2011  9:17AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2011 9:17AM by jackson_tegu.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To Scott: New thread!

I run them.<br/><br/>My introduction to all this was a brilliantly simple game that we learned as we played, with no pre-talk about any of the "game theory" or "social contract" or expectations.  We just played.  And it just worked.  So that's my strategy.<br/><br/>I say "Hey, do you want to come hang out tonight?  We'll probably play something."  This happens once or twice a week, lately.<br/><br/>Eventually, some people want to talk about the games, but not many of them.  A lot of people just play, and have a vague sense of like or dislike, but don't want to think about the why.<br/><br/>I come on here to listen to other people talk about them, which I enjoy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336424/#Comment_336424" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-29T16:55:17+00:00" title="July 29, 2011  4:55PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite>I hang here at SG, but the discussions became less interesting when the design threads were hid away in Praxis.

Some months it felt like there was a lot more of that than there was cross-pollination.  It could get pretty unfriendly at its worst, so on balance I think we gained more with the Praxis split than we lost.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
