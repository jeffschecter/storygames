Tough question.<br/><br/>On one hand, it's an interesting idea -- certainly inverts the whole, "make your character first and then we'll work outwards from there" framework; if I'm not mistaken, you're supposed to work on the basic setting issues, and juxtapose them with the classical "weird ideas" that you get from sf, and <em>only then</em> do you even think about your characters.<br/><br/>It looks like a cool idea, but I'm getting this feeling that it may be a hard sell to old school role-players, or people who aren't terribly familiar with either story-games or social sf ala Ursula Le Guin or Alfred Bester. Incidentally, both those names came up because I've seen copies of <cite>the Dispossessed</cite> and <cite>The Stars My Destination</cite> with cover designs so eerily similar to yours. It's tr\xe9s cool.<br/><br/>Except... some people seem to have problems with the clarity (or lack thereof) of the rule-set.

It's stuck vaguely as "story element" in my memory, but I wasn't sure what <em>kind</em> of story element. Alexander William's post actually clarified a lot of things, at any rate.<br/><br/>So... a Shock is in essence an element of the fictional setting, often a difference between the fictional setting and the real world (examples include tentacle monsters, cloning, superluminal space travel, the Force, god-like transcendent minds, dragons, jaunting, fantasy pseudo-feudalism, other dimensions, a hostile spirit world encroaching upon an oblivious humanity, extensive body modification, magic). <br/><br/>Another element in character creation is an Issue, which is an idea that the players and GM will want to explore (examples would include Libertarianism, Worker's Rights, Alcoholism, Drug Use, Abortions, The Post-Modern Condition, Personal Responsibility, The Cost of Celebrity, Civil Rights, Gay Rights, Sexuality, Individuality, Self Deception/Groupthink). <br/><br/>In the Shock: system, characters are formed in the junction area between Shock: and Issue, of which I'm not exactly sure how.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

In the above example, you might say, "OK, so the government wants every birth or abortion registered and I'm a pregnant 14 year old, which is illegal. My Antagonist is a Fertility Agent." Then the person to your left says, "OK, I'm a Fertility Agent, and the Agency hired me after I successfully hid my own pregnancy and childbearing. They were so impressed with my evasive talents, they hired me." Since you're both building these characters that are colliding together over this thing, "Teen Pregnancy" and "OOWG" are going to factor hugely.</p>\n<p>It's something that happens in play. It doesn't need a score or anything; it's because you <em>agree</em> to make a story about that. Along the way, people often incidentally address other issues, too, which is great. Sometimes the secondary issues wind up being more important to people. I don't care about that so long as they're making the SF they want. It's not like I'm going to scowl at people if the issues they wind up addressing aren't on the Grid.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80773/#Comment_80773" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T22:36:25+00:00" title="July 11, 2007 10:36PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.
