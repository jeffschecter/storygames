(This would depend on actual sizing of course).<br/>The cards, except the location, are kinda (I assume deliberately) repulsive. That doesn't make me want to play the game although I assume it would have the opposite effect on (edit: some) others.<br/>However these things are really hard to judge on a monitor vs hard copy since the garish colours will tone down a lot. (So many games these days seem to have components that look basically grey on black to me, I assume they looked great on a monitor).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405638/#Comment_405638" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-07T04:51:19+00:00" title="February  7, 2013  4:51AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your background colors are super saturated i.e. too much chroma (chroma is how bright a color is).  That yellow is especially garish.  Earth tones for backgrounds and cool colors will work better for you.  It seems the genre is some kinda mash up between fairy tales and mob politics.  These bright colors do NOT say fairy tale in any way, shape or form.  Nor do we get a pulp, noir feel for the mob vibe except "hole in the desert"..which has a cool vibe to it.  These bright colors say kid's game to me... or maybe even 50s/60s superheroes.  Especially that yellow which falls squarely into that ol' "Marvel Comics yellow".  <br/><br/>As for the drawings themselves, I'm kinda eh.  I'm not a fan of the modelled 3d treatment of the skin tones on Jack, Rumple and Cindy and yet their clothes are totally flat.  As iconography, here you are on much better ground.  I think "im going to kill you', "betray', 'capture' and 'bad luck' are very strong visually, telling the narrative in very simple, direct terms.<br/><br/>So from my POV, mixed bag.  <br/><br/>btw, I am a professional artist.  My website is www.StornArt.com.  Your project seems very cool and if I can help, let me know.

Silence is hard to interpret.<br/><br/>Robb - I've got a proof copy coming to me from the printer. They are printed on 2.5x3.5 inch cards. I expect the colors will tone down considerable but I won't know till I see one. <br/><br/>Bob - I'm not home printing these puppies. I'm done with that. At best I can make something that looks like it was made in a garage because they are. Card printing is now cheap enough that I can go to an outside printer for short runs - which is what I can sell. <br/><br/>I'm saddened that the reaction is meh. I like them - of course - since they express the style of art I like. <br/><br/>I'm heavily influenced by 1960's pop art - Andy Worhol, Peter Max, and the use of color in abstract art. I like bold loud direct messages that has clash and abstraction. Realism isn't a prime focus so when I do the skin tones I'm thinking as much about the abstractness of it as I am about creating depth. The game is set in a plastic Las Vegas like world where the contrasts of lights and colors are garish and people are flat. In those terms it looks like I've succeeded in communicating that - unfortunately it isn't appealing to anyone to get them to play the game. <br/><br/>I'll be taking the proof copy out to do more play tests - to see how the art works for people. It may be that I just am not going to be able to speak to this audience (if the silence means people are being polite and not saying what they don't like). Perhaps I should switch to kids games. This is as edgy as I get. <br/><br/>Please to others - I really do want your feedback.

As I imagine playing this game, I'd want that included in the story somehow.  The aesthetic would dispose me towards over-the-top action, larger-than-life and archetypal character portrayal, and random and dissonant twists of fate.  Maybe <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i> crossed with Tarantino kewlness and freakiness.  <br/><br/>This sounds fun to me, but I agree with Storn's criticism in that it's very different from what you pitched -- "Fairy tales + Sin City".  Everything that happens in Sin City pops out of some creepy shadow, and I associate fairy tales with natural beauty and subtle fantasy and deception.<br/><br/>That Rumpelstiltskin card doesn't make me want to use fay seduction or grit my teeth through a gunshot wound; it makes me want to spout some overlong pithy analogy before getting in my Ferrari to run over a ninja in a disco.<br/><br/>If you're cool with that, then I think the cards are going in the right direction.  I might change how you pitch it, though.<br/><br/>Hope this helps!<br/>-David<br/><br/>P.S. I have not seen "Once upon a time", so might be off-base with "fairy tale" thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405679/#Comment_405679" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-07T14:08:12+00:00" title="February  7, 2013  2:08PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the Betray image, I think you're succeeding with the style you're going for on that one. I sort of like the cover, but when I looked closer the geometry of the shoes stopped making sense to me. I had a really strong negative reaction to the "shading" or whatever it is on the character cards, the color transitions in the skin areas create harsh lines in places that my eye doesn't expect them so I kind of recoil from them. I might like Capture and Bad Luck images if the face details were blanked out, but as they are something's not working for me. The Highway card looks kind of nice but the color palette makes it seem like it doesn't fit with the rest of the art.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405715/#Comment_405715" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T04:18:45+00:00" title="February  8, 2013  4:18AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any reason Cinderella is dressed like a stripper?

I like over the top. It the type of place I can imagine going to after a long week of psychotherapy. Because I deal with pretty raw human emotion on a daily basis bringing that into the games I play isn't much of a premium. Kinda want unreality and color rather than dark and grim. I'm pretty sure that is the opposite direction of most people on story games.<br/><br/>I got the proof copy of the deck last night. The printing did mute down the colors and because of them being on 2.5x3.5 cards the eye blends the skin tones at an arms length view. The colors do make the cards stand out of the table so they don't disappear. I will try to get a picture of what the table set up looks like so you can see the end effect. <br/><br/>Please don't worry about giving me critical feedback. I want real opinions. I'm not seeking to convert anyone, I just want to refine my message.

The location cards a little closer together than I'd like but the desk is a little small. The five action cards are the bottom are spread out like a players hand. <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://hamsterpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo.jpg"/><br/><br/>The cards do stand out of the table and are distinctive which is useful in play. I think the style of art is consistent. They Keystone Cop is out of sync with the sexy vibe I'm trying to reach with the other characters but I couldn't resist. I have a dry sense of humor and that's a dig on the authorities. <br/><br/>So why a sexy Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, etc.? It flows from the title of the game Assassin League. These are not nice innocent fairy tale heroes. They live in fairy tale Las Vegas where dreams are built in a day a dashed to pieces in a minute. They are pretty but can kick the shit out of you if you cross them. Or maybe they are victims - too cute to live. Player characters can't die in this game until the last scene but NPCs can drop like flies. The contrast of blood and glitz are meant to be stark - like one of those Hammer horror films where they dropped dark shadows and replaced it with full color (I'm particularly thinking of Vincent Price's Dr Phibes movies). <br/><br/>How do you think the art works when it is all on the table? Any alterations of your opinions? does the total effect help or hurt?<br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405725/#Comment_405725" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T06:43:37+00:00" title="February  8, 2013  6:43AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I, too, really like the cover.  I think it succeeds whereas the cards don't quite...although I love Big Red Wolf's pose from the above photo.  <br/><br/>Now, Wharhol in my opinon, is really responding to Lichtenstien.  And Lichtenstien was using 50s and 60s comics to do his pop art thang.  But here is the rub on what Lichtenstien was doing, he was standing on the shoulders of some real craftsmen.  Here is what Lichtenstien and Warhol had going for them, their outlines?  There was real variation to them... a thick and thin in the same stroke.  Warhol "cheated", he was using photographs, which had pretty good contrast to them prior to slapping on the outrageous tones of color.  A solid foundation, in other words. \n<blockquote> like one of those Hammer horror films where they dropped dark shadows and replaced it with full color</blockquote>  But it doesn't matter what color the shadows are, if the value of the shadows and the placement of the shadows are right.  Which is precisely why Warhol's photos work and why maybe your cards are not quite working.  Your foundation isnot quite there.   <br/><br/>For example:   Your outlines are pretty uniformly 1 thickness.  Like on "I'm going to kill you"... the arm/hand pointing towards the viewer would benefit from having a thicker outline than the lines behind it.  The arm could use a thicker outline and the bottom of the form (where shadows are more likely to be) than the top part of the arm.  You can still retain the playful "simplicity" (not simple at all) of the art, but make them more alive by varying your line weight...and it will give you more structure and foundation to have the insane color schemes to hang on.  <br/><br/>Best book on inking I've come across is The Art of Comic Booking inking by Gary Martin (Dark horse)  (link here:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Comic-Book-Inking-2nd/dp/1593074050" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Art-Comic-Book-Inking-2nd/dp/1593074050</a>).  Even if you aren't trying to emulate comics... you are trying to create your forms with so few lines, every line really matters.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405731/#Comment_405731" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T08:10:05+00:00" title="February  8, 2013  8:10AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did all the pieces using Adobe Ideas on my ipad.
