They ran a seminar about their upcoming projects and needless to say, Doctor Who was talked about quite a bit.  I didn't make it to that seminar because I was working the Collective Endeavour booth, but from what I hear this sounds really, really positive.  Here are one guy's notes (pinched from his post of RPG.net)\n<blockquote><cite>Ahnirades</cite>I attended the Cubicle 7 seminar yesterday. The following was revealed:<br/><br/>* The game will be released as a boxed set, and will contain a Players Guide, a GM's Guide, an Adventures Book, a GM screen and some funky Who-themed dice. Everything will be full colour and glossy, with plenty of photos from the new show. Scheduled for a 'Summer 2008' release it will sell for \xa325-\xa330. <br/><br/>* It will be possible to play Time Lords, Companions, UNIT soldiers or anyone else you can think of. The competence disparity between characters will be mitigated in a similar way to the Buffy RPG. Dave Chapman has great fondness for Blink, and wants to include the option of playing a Sparrow &amp; Nightingale type of campaign. Playing the Doctor will also be an option.<br/><br/>* The system will be based off a single conflict resolution mechanic that can be applied to anything, from hypnotism to fisticuffs. The GM and players will narrate the specifics, tailoring it to the situation at hand. It sounded like a crunchier version of Risus to my ears. And yes, your characters can die if they lose a critically dangerous conflict.<br/><br/>* Characters will earn 'Story Points' during play, which can be used to effect the outcome of events. From the sound of it these effects will range from the minor (a bonus to a single di roll) to the truly mind-boggling (Rose absorbing the Time Vortex and blowing up the Dalek fleet). The system is designed to mimic stuff like the Doctor suddenly coming up with an arcane and convoluted solution to a  problem that actually works. Think Adventure's dramatic editing mechanic, although with a much wider potential scope. The players are encouraged to be as creative as possible when spending Story Points, and the game will ideally run as a fast-paced dialogue over the screen. <br/><br/>* Devices will be created in the same way as PC's, and will possess unique characteristics, including a Story Point pool that allows them to behave in unusual ways. Thus the Sonic Screwdriver could be used to open mundane doors whenever you fancied, but to to use it as a weapon you'd need to spend SP's.</blockquote>\nCould this be the properly handled entry level RPG licensed game that everyone else manages not to make?  I mean, people generally get a great license, then they release a pretty cookie cutter RPG which has no appeal to non gamers.  Or in the worst cases, they release a d20 setting based on a film which can't even be played or understood by someone who doesn't own the core D&amp;D books.  But this appears to be very firmly aimed at the 12 -16 year old market who love the show first and foremost.  To anyone who doesn't live in the UK: You have no idea how massive the franchise is over here!  This has the potential to be massive.<br/><br/>(As an aside, IIRC boxed sets are subject to VAT in the UK, whereas books are not.  Ouch!)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111243/#Comment_111243" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T05:23:50+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  5:23AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I told my 10 year old daughter (who can quote Nu-Who canon, chapter and verse) and her reaction was to bounce around as if Christmas had come early!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111244/#Comment_111244" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T05:29:39+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  5:29AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vodkashok</cite>I told my 10 year old daughter (who can quote Nu-Who canon, chapter and verse) and her reaction was to bounce around as if Christmas had come early!!!<br><br>Neil</br></br></blockquote>\nThis was my reaction when I heard as well....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111248/#Comment_111248" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T05:40:45+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  5:40AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Blue</cite>This was my reaction when I heard as well....</blockquote>\n*Raises hand* Me too, to be honest.<br/><br/>The game is definitely Nu Who, from what I hear.  Which is great.  For those who aren't as sad as me, the BBC treat Doctor Who 2005 as a completely different thing from Doctor Who Classic for marketing/licensing.  Although there are hints that Classic stuff might be included or possible too.<br/><br/>When I heard that Cubicle Seven had the license I was really, really happy.  Basically because it meant Mongoose didn't have it.  I'd assumed that it was going to be Fate based, because C7 are doing Brit Sci-Fi game Starblazer Adventures using Fate.  I'd have been happy as hell with a Fate Doctor Who game, but it looks like it'll be something more accessible for younger readers/players.  Which HAS to be great for marketing and sales.  And also sounds like it's going to be tops for me too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111260/#Comment_111260" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T06:36:30+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  6:36AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's great news.

Which will probably be August?  But we all know that RPG release dates are seldom stuck to.  I'm sure this will be worth the wait though.<br/><br/>The split of books is probably (and I say this with exactly zero authority) to make it slightly less intimidating to young readers and also to make it seem like there's more "stuff" in the box.  Also so that the GM kid can lend the Player's Book to one of the kids who'll be playing and so that they don't get to see the contents of the Adventures book.<br/><br/>Apparently there are "talks" about this getting into some bookstores in the US.  UK Bookshops will almost certainly stock this.  You can literally sell anything in a bookshop if it's got Doctor Who on it.  Like the "Battles In Time CCG is about as easy to find in shops over here as Pokemon was at it's height.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111301/#Comment_111301" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T09:02:41+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  9:02AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll order it from Amazon.uk and pay the extra shipping if I have to.

I think the game will just get into my hands, then I'll tear it open, set up the GM Screen and start walking the players through character creation.  I'm impossibly excited.  <br/><br/>Good work, you guys over at C7.  You've got some people very excited over here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111529/#Comment_111529" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T07:18:14+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  7:18AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have snagged the first disk of the new series off of netflix in anticipation.<br/><br/>I never saw any Dr. Who, know absolutely nothing about it other than what I have picked up here and there on the internet.<br/><br/>Good luck, Dr. Who-ites.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111531/#Comment_111531" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T07:20:56+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  7:20AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Good luck, Dr. Who-ites.</blockquote>\nThat's Whovians.<br/><br/>Christ, I feel dirty just knowing that...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111555/#Comment_111555" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T08:45:18+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  8:45AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I have snagged the first disk of the new series off of netflix in anticipation.<br/><br/>I never saw any Dr. Who, know absolutely nothing about it other than what I have picked up here and there on the internet.<br/><br/>Good luck, Dr. Who-ites.</blockquote>\nI really enjoy the show.  The first series has Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor, who is great, but I'm a bigger fan of the latter Doctor, David Tennant.  Personally, I also found the stories of series one to better than those of series two, but the interplay between the Tennant Doctor and his companion Rose was much more fun in the latter series of the show.  Then there's series three, which is probably the strongest of the set.  <br/><br/>Also, just to whet your appetite, there is an episode in series two that has ninjas fighting werewolves in the Victorian English countryside.  <br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite><br/>That's Whovians.<br/><br/>Christ, I feel dirty just knowing that...</blockquote>\nWell, Whovians <i>sounds</i> dirty, so I can understand your sentiment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lexifab" title="lexifab"><img alt="lexifab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lexifab">lexifab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111709/#Comment_111709" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T15:32:51+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  3:32PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Good luck, Dr. Who-ites.</blockquote>\nThat's Whovians.<br/><br/>Christ, I feel dirty just knowing that...<br/><br/>Um, I think Doctor Who fans are only called Whovians in the US.
