It doesn't seem to be a reaction to anything. The writer doesn't have a chip on his shoulder, something to prove, all those things that make for neurotic art. It's just a game that he's published once, played a lot, improved, revised and now published in a new edition.</blockquote>\nThat's an interesting point, and one which I hadn't really considered. Frankly, I never even considered designing Dread as a reaction to something else -- it was just me tossing my hat into the ring. I wanted to design my own horror game, and I wanted to do it on my own terms. So I designed my own system, created my own universe, and wrote my own text. Nothing radical about it. My question is, does that sound typical? Is that how most of you have approached the design of your game?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Se\xc3\xb1or Matthijs</cite>The scenarios are... well, they're very, very American, and so is the focus of the setting. The issues are American (Traitors vs. Patriots, Christian terrorists), the NPCs are typical of American TV/action movies \xe2\u20ac\u201c it's all smooth politicians, military cover-ups and... hip-hop groups. Which is okay, since it's primarily for an American audience; however, it does pose some problems for me as a European. I have three choices: Playing it American style, which means copying U.S. TV; trying to use the setting in Norway, which feels weird, since Norwegian action movies/TV aren't really the same as their U.S. Counterparts; or trying to emulate Norwegian movies/TV, which the game doesn't really support that well. Of course, this isn't going to be a problem if you're from Over There.</blockquote>\nThis didn't occur to me while I was working on Dread, to be honest. I really just assumed that smooth politicians, military cover-ups, and pop musicians were sort of universal. But it seems like that's not the case. If you live outside of the US, how often do you encounter this sort of Americentric approach in American-made games? How do you work around it? Has any game managed to sidestep this problem?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103916/#Comment_103916" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-19T16:51:19+00:00" title="October 19, 2007  4:51PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>If you live outside of the US, how often do you encounter this sort of Americentric approach in American-made games?

I really wonder if Polaris would feel very American...I mean I haven't read it yet, but i have hard to believe that that would be my reaction to that game. But on the other hand, almost all of us watch way more American TV and cinema than anything else, so when it comes to media this is also our baseline. So it doesn't really have to be a problem. But in fiction about our own countries we expect somewhat different stories. Swedish TV-series and movies are usually about a policeman who has a problematic relationship to his daughter and has a continuous problem with getting his laundry washed. I kind of like it. (Bergman was more clever, but he died.)<br/><br/>I mean, I even see this in Swedish games. I guess Senor Matthijs himself has written one of the best examples of a game that feel purely Nordic in setting. There is also this marvelous Swedish mainstream comic rpg Mutant (the setting is amazing, as a game it is basically pure Basic Roleplaying (!) and it is genetically, but not otherwise, related to Mutant Chronicles) that is totally saturated with Swedishness.<br/><br/>But really, the contemporary settings in tabletop campaigns I have played in have always taken place in US. With oneshots there is a mixed history, Swedish oneshot freeform scenarios generally takes place in Sweden. In larp though, because of the scene, I have only played scenarios taking place in Sweden (and in a Soviet submarine, played in an actual Soviet submarine. With Danes.). If I am ever to start a longer campaign again it would be very fun to have it play out in Sweden. I think it very much would affect the type of stories we would be playing. When we started our Orpheus (White Wolf, oWoD) campaign back in the days (where are still struggling to finish it of, but we will any decade now!) I did some lobbying to move the game to Sweden, but it would just have been to much work; so thought our GM at least. So we did it kosher and played in NY (and it has been a blast, so I won't complain).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104507/#Comment_104507" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T05:16:59+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  5:16AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sven</cite>But really, the contemporary settings in tabletop campaigns I have played in have always taken place in US.</blockquote>\nSorry -- do you mean that the published materials are set in the US, or that the gameplay defaults to the US, regardless of setting?<br/><br/>Also, what (if anything) can American developers do to make their game scenarios more universal?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104844/#Comment_104844" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T11:46:05+00:00" title="October 25, 2007 11:46AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>Also, what (if anything) can American developers do to make their game scenarios more universal?</blockquote>\nAre you sure they/you should? Here are a few reasons why not:<br/>- Writing about things you know is inspiring, and you'll be able to write with confidence and detail.<br/>- Trying to be universal means losing a lot of detail and context.<br/>- People don't actually want universal scenarios.

The last few years, my group has been playing games that allow us to create the setting ourselves, or games that have been made by members of the group. Which is probably the reason I'm noticing these things so much more now than I used to; back when Cyberpunk came out, I wouldn't have thought twice about its U. S. bias, while now, I'd feel weird playing it. (I keep thinking of bands I've heard that try hard to be American while singing in broken English - that sort of weird).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104875/#Comment_104875" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T13:10:19+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  1:10PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Americanocentrism in rpgs is a well-known "problem."

The culture is bound to bleed through.<br/><br/>There are some games that I have some problems with (Dogs in the Vineyard being a noteworthy example; it seems to depend closely on an american cultural background),but not to such an extent that I cant play them.<br/><br/>Honestly,I dont think this is a problem that needs fixing.

Orpheus is a special case, since it is so deeply put into American soild (although I talked to a Swede who acytally played it taking place in Sweden, but you really have to work to make that flow with the meta story.). But the main thing is that we are so used to American fiction that we put usually choose an American setting. Any campaign that included a lot of action would to many Swedes feel very goofy taking place over here. So when we started a techno campaign in Mage we put in US, since it was so much easier to relate to than our homeground.<br/><br/>Interesting to note might be that when those of us who have reached a certain age... and perhaps because of this want to have games that treat almost intirely more serious issues, then we choose to let them take place in Sweden. And it's not strange: When I think of action or huge dramas I conjure up pictures of American cities in my mind. When I think about adultery, friendship and the type of love that I can relate to on a personal level I think about small cities in southern Sweden and when treating these subject we also end up putting the games there.<br/><br/>I really don't see it as a big problem, but interesting to dissect, nevertheless. But Matthijs makes a good observation:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>(I keep thinking of bands I've heard that try hard to be American while singing in broken English - that sort of weird).</blockquote>\nYou hear this too much! And I have felt that in roleplaying also. On the other hand I wouldn't hesitate playing a character in Iran, which I know *much* less about.<br/><br/>I don't share Matthijs' irritation over capitalism as standard, but that has solely to do with my uncanny rightwingyness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
