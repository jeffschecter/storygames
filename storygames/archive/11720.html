If I ever finish Addict, the recovery game where phases of play are based on the twelve step program, it will be dedicated to her. I, uh, don't know how she'll feel about it.<br/><br/>She's also very tolerant of my playing habits. She is only familiar with the original D&amp;D, which she hated because she rolled for race and got "an ugly orc, and I wanted to be something sexy like an elf." I thought and considered telling her that indie games take more from improv, but she was a professional actress for many years doing experimental theatre and Serious Russian Plays, and considers improv the lowest form. She's probably better off thinking roleplaying is where you have to pretend to play ugly people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261518/#Comment_261518" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T18:20:23+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  6:20PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, if I can add: Shreyas' mother's response to Mist-Robed Gate was: "What's all this crap you put in the front of your cookbook?

She was impressed with the physical artifact of the book, especially since I did it all myself.

They never objected to my gaming on religious grounds (or any other grounds except maybe monetary).<br/><br/>Tangent 2: Interesting to see a lot of mentions of Odyssey of the Mind (and the slightly different but mostly similar Destination Imagination).

I got it, read it, tried to run it for my all girl birthday party (which resulted in some embarrassment and confusion and then watching a movie instead). But my Mom was the one who was always trying to get us to do things, and she knew I liked this vampire stuff, and she saw there was this gaming convention called Origins in Ohio, and did I want to go to that? She drove my best friend Maria and my brother when I was 15. She always dropped us off at the local comic store to play games too.<br/><br/>Now that I'm getting closer to 30, I don't really talk about it too much, cause they're kinda of the frame of mind I should be beyond all that.

You went every day and played different kinds of games.  I think they gave me a free solo dungeon to take home.<br/><br/>She supported me all through those late 70s early 80s games, which says a lot for her open mindedness.  It was something that kept my interest and creativity and did with friends, so it was cool with her.  Even if it wasn't cool with some of the more conservative folk in the community.<br/><br/>I recently heard from a friend, who has started dating a woman who I went to high school with, that she was surprised he was friends with me; she had always thought of me as kind of a "dark" type, because I played role playing games.  Anyone who knows me now and sees how comical that is, it was equally comical if not much more so in high school.  I did not have a "badass" phase in high school, I was pure chubby bespectacled nerd all the way through. It shows just how bad a rep those games had in my community, that playing them was enough to make me a spooky dude in her mind.<br/><br/>But my mom supported me all the time.  She thinks it's great that I still do illustrations for games now and then.  She's happy when I mention I get a rare chance to actually play.  I haven't designed any games so I can't speak to that.  But she's just generally an awesome mom and always has been, with respect to gaming as much as anything else.<br/><br/>Yay mom!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261718/#Comment_261718" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T14:19:46+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  2:19PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GB Steve ,that is incredibly awesome.  thanks for showing us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261719/#Comment_261719" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T14:29:43+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  2:29PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (This would confirm the theory that parental support is nice, but not really necessary, I guess.

She's not overtly interested in playing them now-a-days, but she began that journey by indulging my curious and creative side.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does she think of them now? Well, for playing them, she often asks how my games are going and enjoys hearing the silly stories. She buys me rpg books for Christmas (From IPR no less, my mom rocks) and wants the Serenity rpg book purely because she loves Firefly that much.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs writing games (I'm just doing that now), she wants to read them and see what it's all about. My mom's a really supportive, awesome person and I love how interested she is in my hobbies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261748/#Comment_261748" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T17:57:11+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  5:57PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>Here's what I was referring to in my earlier contribution to this thread:</blockquote>\nThat's the best thing I've seen online in about a month. <br/><br/>Maybe longer. <br/><br/>Rock on Steve's mom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261761/#Comment_261761" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T21:44:52+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  9:44PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Meguey Baker has that hat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261854/#Comment_261854" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-13T19:09:42+00:00" title="March 13, 2010  7:09PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My mom supported my entry into role-playing games thirty or so years ago.  All she knew of them at first was that I was a "dungeon master" and that my four players were all "cute" girls.  To the extent she understood our activities, she saw my participation as social and creative.  For my twelfth birthday she gave me a red shirt that said "Dungeon Master" on it in sparkly gold lettering, something I wore proudly at sessions.  Though they were divorced from one another and pretty poor, my parents agreed communally to buy me the 1st edition Monster Manual I talked about incessantly.  Over time, my mother understood that my imaginative games were considered "nerdy" by the mainstream.  And then she supported it all the more.<br/><br/>These days I think she understands my continued participation in the hobby through the lens of my participation in improvisational theater.  (not active in that currently)  She also puts it under a broader "gamer" umbrella and enjoys some of the boardgames I've introduced her to.  Sometimes when I'm teaching a new boardgame she advises everyone to be quiet and pay attention because I'm in my "dungeon master" role.  She has occasionally hinted at wishing I was less "escapist" because she imagines I'd otherwise have have provided her with a grandchild, even though childlessness was primarily an environmental decision unconnected from my main hobby.<br/><br/>Steve: That is ridiculously awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What does your mother think of your games? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11720/what-does-your-mother-think-of-your-games/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="What does your mother think of your games? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11720/what-does-your-mother-think-of-your-games/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Holy crap, Steve.

I had been playing D&amp;D with faculty brats from the local liberal arts college for a couple years.  Mom finally heard the "Satan" stories, and talked Dad into putting a stop to my favorite hobby.  We spent about an hour talking it over.  I don't think I've ever given a more persuasive argument in my life.<br/><br/>They relented, but I had to invite my friends over to our house for our next session.  Dad watched us play.  He saw the miniatures and the dice and the decision-making, and was like, oh, it's a strategy game.  And he's been cool with it since.<br/><br/>Mom still doesn't understand it.  She gave me shit about buying $40 rulebooks while I was in college (I guess I should have been spending my money on beer instead?).  Now, when I say I'd like to publish my own games, my parents smile politely, but they both have this nervous, "yeah, right" look in their eyes.  <br/><br/>So I guess that puts me at the "proving them all wrong" stage. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262312/#Comment_262312" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T12:02:04+00:00" title="March 16, 2010 12:02PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My mom taught me D&amp;D thirty years ago.
