I'm just inspired to draw some attention to it at the moment, and get the ball rolling for musings on new implementations.<br/><br/>A lot of my favorite roleplaying sessions have consisted mostly of character dialogue and action with zero formal rules contact.  Typical example: several sessions into a campaign, the players have gotten invested in some element of the fiction, the player characters are grappling with that, there's some moving through new places and seeing new things, making decisions about which priority to pursue, initiating tense negotiations with NPCs, etc.  There are situations that need progressing, and questions that need answering, and the build-up, effort, and outcome of all this is experienced without any interruption to "I'm in character, imagining I'm there".  <br/><br/><span style="color: #000096;">You want info from the NPC guard.  We need to determine if you get it.  How do we determine that?  You play your character, and I play the guard, and we interact, and that's it.</span><br/><br/>I make no claims that any of this is objectively a good thing.  All I can say is that, when it happens, I like it a lot, and I know other players who feel the same.<br/><br/>Having said that, I'll readily admit that, in a medium (RPGs) where successful play is <i>highly</i> dependent on the contributions of the participants, the above process is <i>especially</i> so.  In case anyone reading hasn't experienced a failure of this process firsthand, here's what it looks like: a boring conversation that doesn't go anywhere or resolve anything.  <span style="color: #000096;">You talk to the NPC, eager to find out what they know, but they don't tell you, and you aren't sure of the best way to ask, and you're not sure of the consequences of asking the wrong way, and you're out of ideas, and you sputter, and they react to you sputtering, and you give up, and you look up at the other players and see that watching this awkward waste of time has sucked the life out of them.</span><br/><br/>Personally, I know of many, many, many safeguards against this sort of thing, in the form of rules which offer guarantees.  "Want info from an NPC?  Roll these dice and look on this table and you are guaranteed to get something that will move play forward!  You never need to prod and grind and sputter and bail, ever again!"  <br/><br/>This is great, but I have rarely played such a session that didn't throw the baby I love out with the bathwater I hate.  The people I game with don't discover a neat, useful game procedure and then <i>not</i> use it.  <b>Once "roll for NPC info" is on the table, those long roleplayed conversations with NPCs tend to disappear.</b>  (To me, this seems natural -- a game's resolution procedures are not merely options lying around passively; they are active statements about what players should care about.  The focal point of the NPC encounter is nudged toward "what happened" and away from "what was it like".)<br/><br/>So, here we have two options, each with plenty of published games, play cultures, theories and history behind them.  I don't see them as being at odds: different strokes for different folks, you can learn the skills to excel at either one, there's no badwrongfun; case closed.  What's more interesting, to me anyway, is their <i>integration</i>.  For example:<br/><br/>Do you want your all-in-character roleplay experience with no pesky dice?  Great, start with that.  Go!  Do you <i>also</i> want to avoid roleplaying yourself into a Corner of No Fun?  Here's a tool for use in exactly that circumstance:  <b>the "I just want to resolve _" card</b>.  The card isn't a killer app, it isn't a glittery toy begging to be played with.  It isn't a list of conditions you can maneuver your character into for mechanical advantage.  It's a simple escape hatch, a Plan B for when Plan A isn't working.  Maybe put a whiny, frowny face on the card to drive home the point that this is <i>not Plan A</i>.  When you <i>can</i>, roleplay it out!  But when you <i>can't</i>, better to bail and move on than to persist past the point of enjoyable play.<br/><br/><span style="color: #000096;">You talk to the NPC guard, you're starting to feel stumped, you're not sure how important this is anyway, you want to get to the next activity on your list, no one seems stoked by the interaction.  You show your card to the group.  The roleplay stops.  You say, "I just want to resolve whether this guy gives me the info I'm looking for."</span>  It's a sacrifice!  You're not going to befriend this guy, or learn what he blabs about some unrelated thing, or further your knowledge of city guard procedures, or notice who else is taking an interest in your conversation.  And that's fine.  The "just resolve" card isn't for that; roleplaying it out is for that.  The "just resolve" card just resolves one thing, so we can update the fictional situation and then resume roleplaying.<br/><br/>Once the card's out, I don't have any particular thoughts about what the resolution procedure has to be.  It should be quick, it should meaningfully answer the question, it should not predictably produce better or worse outcomes than roleplaying, and it should otherwise serve the priorities of the game in question.<br/><br/>Is anyone else interested in this sort of thing?  Any thoughts on my idea?  Any different ideas on achieving the same or similar goals?<br/><br/>Ps,<br/>-David                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394577/#Comment_394577" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T01:09:47+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  1:09AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AW's read a person move encourages the conversation to continue by giving the PC specific out of game questions they can ask the MC about the NPCs intent and motivations.<br/><br/>I personally find that the all roleplaying all the time approach puts a lot of load on the GM and reduces character variety as it tends to default to player skill.

Seemingly minor, but terribly important in its implications.<br/><br/>Your card idea is kind of like that. A tool that can be picked up for a specific use. It doesn't need to be core, and maybe down the road, it can be dropped. Or maybe it isn't needed initially, but it could be useful to have in your groups' bag of tricks, waiting to be trotted out when one of those moments comes up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Himalayan_Salt" title="Himalayan_Salt"><img alt="Himalayan_Salt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Himalayan_Salt">Himalayan_Salt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394604/#Comment_394604" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T09:29:01+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  9:29AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Generally the reason people just roll and move on is because the conversation with the guard isn't important enough to go into a lot of detail.

Hollywood execs care deeply about such things, and RPG players are starting to get onboard as well: "How long do we spend on 'combat'?" or "When do we know Player X is a spotlight hog?" etc.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that quickness is the ideal and that role-playing is a burden, but I am saying that we often presume that either combat or PC-NPC conversation is where the "meat" of an RPG session lies, when that may not be the case.<br/><br/>So rolling = (presumably) quick resolution to guard situation <i>to move on to something else</i><br/>So role-playing = longer form resolution to guard situation that <i>insists on this guard's reality and relative importance within the diegesis/narrative</i>.<br/><br/>The time we devote to <i>any</i> activity at a given RPG table has an aesthetic impact on the fiction, in its own way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394654/#Comment_394654" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T13:22:53+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  1:22PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            K-Bob, can ya link me that book?

Allowing the group to make in-the-moment decisions about whether <i>this</i> chat or <i>this</i> chase or <i>this</i> combat is important has some key advantages over broadly declaring that this game wants to spend time on chases but not chats.  Basically, the magic moments that raise play to its most enjoyable level can come from anywhere, and arrive at any time.  So, let's say we have two conversations where we gather info from guards:<br/><br/>1. The player really just wants the info, and to move on to making a decision based on that info.  The rest of the players likewise are anticipating that decision.  The GM wants to deliver some prepped clues.<br/><br/>2. The player is embodying their character, the GM is embodying the guard, and it just so happens that the player and GM achieve an unexpected synergy.  The character takes an interest in the guard's rough life, and the guard vents about how the city guard operates, and how he wound up with this job.  And the player gets really worked up over this, and develops an intense hatred of the city government.  And that roleplayed interaction shows everyone a side of this character they'd never seen before, and becomes a defining moment for them.<br/><br/>My idea here is that we maximize our chances of number 2 happening... but we don't force it when it isn't going to happen.<br/><br/>I think that any pre-game decision of "let's have an action-packed game with little time spent on NPC chats" needs to be weighed against the "roleplay it out" priority.  Personally, when I'm in a "roleplay it out" mood, I can't ever see myself agreeing to "more action time, less talk time".  But that may just be me.<br/><br/>As for your larger point, I completely agree: <i>what fictional content gets how much play time devoted to it</i> is one of <i>the</i> defining features of any session.  I simply hesitate to equate "fictional content" with broad action or scene types.  When you make a movie that's already written, you begin a shot knowing what its purpose is, and when it's served that purpose, you cut.  In a "roleplay it out" RPG session, on the other hand, you may be surprised by what the point of the scene winds up being, as it wasn't scripted.  (Not that I'm advocating starting scenes with <i>no</i> point!  I'm just saying that allowing in-the-moment play to warp that is part of the fun.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394662/#Comment_394662" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T14:02:02+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  2:02PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, I get your point and I like the idea.

It's approaching the gordian knot of what might just get that GM to get that NPC guard to spill the beans, and slicing it in two...with a D20 (okay, the analogy isn't perfect!).<br/><br/>One perspective is that these conversation do not actually reward roleplay. They reward the right things said in the right order. That is not roleplaying, it's a guessing game (and guessing games are good, but it is not playing out a role and being rewarded for that). Further, the guessing is from a myriad of words one might use - so you've got a better chance of rolling the right answer than guessing the right answer.<br/><br/>So one question to ask might are these actually roleplaying opportunities?<br/><br/>Sure, you can use these moments to play out a role. But you can do that in a text based adventure. But at the same time the text based adventure doesn't care, unless you happen to grease the key with the pig that was fired by catapult (the solutions in text based adventures were always mad...)<br/><br/>So maybe they don't roleplay - because these aren't times to roleplay?<br/><br/>Currently, anyway.

If you really, really don't feel that way, then maybe you can copy and paste that whisper to me too?<br/><br/>I love the idea of this mechanic. (The pacing dial in Delve is basically a broader version of this technique, right?) I've never really properly tried it (I don't think we used it very much when we played Delve together, but maybe a couple of times), but would love to experiment with it some more. I remember in the early days of the Forge, there was a lot of excitement about "conflict resolution" for precisely this reason: "We can play and have fun, but if we're stuck, we can just go to the dice!"<br/><br/>The major design challenge here, however, is making the options balanced. I'm not even sure how possible that is, but I would enjoy discussing the possibilities. How can you balance a mechanical solution (like a dice roll) with a player's judgement of the fiction?<br/><br/>Otherwise, I might always go to "resolve" when I see the GM is making something hard, and never at all if I'm getting what I want in the fiction. <br/><br/>Another point: I'm talking to the guard, and I see I'm not getting anywhere, so I say let's roll, and the GM calls out a difficulty number that's REALLY high. Can I then say, "Oh, hang on, actually I'd rather just keep talking"?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394775/#Comment_394775" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T10:51:59+00:00" title="October 25, 2012 10:51AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think it's important to remember\u2014and this isn't trivial, and is very on-topic\u2014that a lot of the problem, historically, with "talk to the guard to get the info you need" is that failing represents a roadblock, in the same way that a failed Lockpicking roll might represent a roadblock. If the GM adopts a "fail forward" mindset, then a couple of things can happen:<br/><br/>1) Players RP with guard, GM decides in his honest consultation of the fiction that they have been sufficiently sympathetic for him to drop the info.<br/><br/>2) Players go right to dice, succeed, get info.<br/><br/>3) Players go right to dice, fail, get "ahem, cough cough, don't you know, my son is sick, his medical bills are really piling up" (guard wants a bribe).<br/><br/>4) Players RP with guard, conversation starts to go in circles... GM can still drop hints that bribing this guy may be the way forward.<br/><br/>The reason option 4 tends <i>not</i> to happen often enough, in my opinion, is because groups that have these kinds of issues are also not on the same page about the game's overall goals. That is to say, the GM may have no idea why the players are talking to the guard in the first place. But if he has at least a general idea of their intentions, then it makes it easier to adopt a fail forward mentality and then all 4 of the above options become a real possibility.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394787/#Comment_394787" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T12:04:50+00:00" title="October 25, 2012 12:04PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>I got the impression Dave wasn't so much talking about scenario design (i.e. a roadblock in the players' way) as he was talking about what the players do at the table (i.e. "We're fine with not getting anything from the guard, because it makes our lives interesting in some other way, but we're pissed off that we wasted 25 minutes figuring that out.").<br/><br/>I could be wrong, however, so I'll wait and see what Dave has to say.

I'm talking about supporting a play style where, at any given moment, you may talk to the guard <i>for the sake of talking to the guard</i>.  The scene has engaged your emotions and your creativity and you want to express your character and make this moment come to life and see what falls out.<br/><br/>In that context, whether you get info from the guard may be very important, or sort of important, or not important at all.  If it was a captivating scene, victory has been achieved, regardless of whether your character <i>accomplished</i> anything.  <br/><br/>The whole notion of entering this scene with an emphasis on <i>getting the info</i> sounds to me like y'all might be playing a different game.<br/><br/>But, for the sake of argument, let's suppose that <i>this</i> scene is one of those times when getting the info <i>is</i> very important to the player.  Let's say they want to know where the Jade Eagle is being stored, because all the players have agreed that they want to plan a heist to steal it.  This heist is going to be super fun, so let's get the info and get rolling!<br/><br/>Once "we need info now" is agreed upon, there are a few things that can happen, which I'll present in checklist form:<br/>1) Does anyone care to play out the info finding, or should we just say the info has been found and keep rolling with our heist momentum?<br/>2) If we do play it out, are we <i>really</i> playing it out, or just doing a sort of check to produce an outcome with a little more color to it?<br/><br/>If you roleplay <i>everything</i> out without thinking about it, then you wind up in some awkward scenes, for sure!  So let's say there's something here that makes the group <i>want</i> to play this scene.  Let's go with the most problematic case: the GM thinks the Eagle's location is valuable info and won't be given freely.  So we continue:<br/><br/>3) Does everyone trust that the only way forward won't be blocked?<br/><br/>Now at last we get to what Matt's talking about.  "Fail forward" is an excellent summary, so I won't go into detail right now.  But basically, here's my thinking:<br/><br/>If you sat down at the table with a desire to "roleplay it out", and you do <i>not</i> have a history of an obstructive GM ruining the game by blocking you, then why in the world would you ever <i>try</i> to read the GM's mind or ask "mother may I"?  You wouldn't.  Those attitudes and behaviors are nothing but patches for a broken process.  (This is what I meant in my reply to Callan.)<br/><br/>If you actually have a process for moving forward through the fiction, then you can relax and "just roleplay".  And, y'know, if the scene turns out to be a dud, "just resolve".<br/><br/>My instinct is to gloss over that process for now and hope we can discuss the "roleplay till you rollplay" idea -- I'm sure there are cool alternatives to my card -- but I guess we'll see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394822/#Comment_394822" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T15:32:08+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  3:32PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2012 3:32PM by Rickard.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, it was good that you clarified about blocking and that you are talking from a point where the group is not dysfunctional.<br/><br/>I came up with another analogy btw.

That may not be the best word for it, but it's something like how in Burning Wheel you want to succeed, but you also need to get tests of certain difficulties. That creates competing pressures, so there are no easy choices.<br/><br/>So, what if, at the end of the session, you were rewarded for the kind of experiential, Simmy stuff you're talking about Dave. Like, for every interesting conversation of non-trivial length with NPCs, every detail about the setting the PCs learned just by observing (and not, crucially, by pulling heists or whatever), and every revelatory or philosophical detail the PCs share in conversations among themselves, gain an XP. (This would also have the salutary effect of reviewing what happened in the session, thus solidifying it in the players' minds. You might also want to move this phase to the start of the following session.) On the other hand, you also have Quests you're trying to accomplish, that you presumably care about and that may even be time-limited. The non-conversational, non-exploratory aspects of the Quests can't be auto-succeeded with the card, of course\u2014you can't use the card to pick the lock on the treasure vault or defeat the guards.<br/><br/>I think something like this structure could work really well for subject material similar to Blowback/Burn Notice, where the PCs are trying to balance "have an actual life and be kinda almost like humans" with "be bad-ass agents on the run."<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394877/#Comment_394877" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T22:58:17+00:00" title="October 25, 2012 10:58PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, OK!

Essentially, you'd be attaching XP loss to the use of this "card", which means that it's clearly flagged as something less desirable (your "Plan B"), but still available to us in order to keep play from stagnating. "Okay, we failed to make this scene fun/interesting, and I don't know what else to add, so no XP for us, but we get to move on to the next bit." Kind of like withdrawing your bid in a gambling round. You know you're not going to get anywhere on this one, so you withdraw to conserve your resources (in gambling, money; in roleplaying, time) for better use on the *next* round/scene/moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394889/#Comment_394889" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-26T00:35:46+00:00" title="October 26, 2012 12:35AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 26, 2012 12:37AM by David_Berg.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, awesome!  I'm leery of that specific process of XP-tallying (tried something similar; fell flat), but the core idea rocks.  I hope to have more to say soon*.<br/><br/>Paul, yeah, the problem-solving isn't the point.  I do want to admit that it will come up, though!  If you're deeply in character, and your character's trying to solve a problem, then for that moment, you basically are too.  I think this is why my example of frustration from my first post can still happen even in groups that are on the same "roleplaying it out is fun" page.  You get caught up in the moment and it can be hard to step back.  Having the "just resolve" card in front of you is a reminder that you can step back.  (So, yeah, pacing dial.  It's the same thing but with less granularity and bigger emphasis on resolution.)<br/><br/>*Dear everyone: that was <i>not</i> a "wait for me" request, so please carry on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394902/#Comment_394902" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-26T06:41:26+00:00" title="October 26, 2012  6:41AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hay David:<br/><br/>I think Levi had some bolt-on mechanic he'd come up with ( although, it may actually have been someone else, so don't quote me),  where everyone at the table got some sort of marker like your card. People could quietly move the marker to the center of the table as a gentle hint that maybe it ws time to cut to the chase. I don't think it was meant for only one person to move it forward. the idea was that the group as a whole were kinda voting to wrap up the scene as more of the markers accumulated.<br/><br/>I don't recall if it had mechanical weight, or if it was more of straight voluntary signalling. I also seem to recall everyone could use it, including a GM.<br/><br/>Maybe you could combine it with your card idea? If the really active talker pushes it forward, it means go to plan b. Other wise, it is just a cue. See one pop out and someone is getting antsy. See a couple pop out and for group good, people should think about wrapping it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
