rel="nofollow">The Metamorphica</a>. While originally built to provide random mutations, I've found it exceptionally good for inspiring the most unpredictable creatures with just a bit of creatively linking the characteristics it gives you. I wrote some stuff about just how to make it do that <a href="http://the-logbook-project.blogspot.com/2012/07/building-alien-with-metamorphica.html" rel="nofollow">if you're interested</a>. In my own experience though it tends to make things seriously non-human unless you're very selective, so if you want your inhabitants to at all resemble humanity, other resources may work more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaser" title="kaser"><img alt="kaser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/686/nMCJHMAE3CEJS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaser">kaser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415214/#Comment_415214" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T20:26:45+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  8:26PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For planet populations, you might find inspiration in <a href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson%27s">@Orlando_Wilson's</a> <i>Six Inhumanities</i>:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17853/six-inhumanities/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17853/six-inhumanities/p1</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415218/#Comment_415218" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T21:14:24+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  9:14PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A nice automated Stars Without Number sector generator: <a href="http://www.emichron.com/swn/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.emichron.com/swn/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maxcharbonne" title="Maxcharbonne"><img alt="Maxcharbonne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maxcharbonne">Maxcharbonne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415221/#Comment_415221" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T21:44:16+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  9:44PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do have the Metamorphica, which is an excellent resource.

Like some categories: exotic terrain, pervasive colours, and different physics are three of the suggestions for the physical planet, and there's 3-6 examples each (like: the sun is red, the atmosphere is caustic, it's a gas giant, etc).<br/><br/>And there's a similar section for creating societies, very much inspired by Six Inhumanities (which kaser mentioned). Six Inhumanities creates alien societies through omission, and I've added three other possibilities: adding stuff to societies that we know (like sci-fi technology); exaggeration, which is what political satires usually do (1984, for example); and substitution, which suggests mixing and matching social structures or replacing human characteristics with animal behaviours and stuff like that. There's about 3 specific techniques for each one and a bunch of examples for each technique.<br/><br/>There's no systematic procedure, though. Just a list of suggestions that are supposed to inspire you, and an example of creating a planet by using them. I think it's cool, but I'm biased. I'd say it's definitely a story games type of thing, where the Metamorphica is more on the old school end of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415228/#Comment_415228" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-01T01:06:24+00:00" title="June  1, 2013  1:06AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a crazy person. <br/><br/>Those rules are about breaking you ethnocentricity and getting alienated.<br/><br/>If that's your jams, then cool.

To construct a thing in order to be, or merely because, it is "odd" to humans only reinforces a humano-centric normality that in turn denies the aliens legitimacy.  It is alien blackface minstrelsy, in effect.<br/><br/>2300AD had the best approach I've seen yet, although it didn't take it far enough.  It proposed that your begin by constructing an ecological pyramid.  Roughly speaking, first construct plants, then herbivores, then predators.  An intelligent alien will almost certainly be an apex predator in its own ecological context.<br/><br/>This gives you aliens that are properly grounded in reality, beings in and of themselves, rather than as allegorical figures.  They can still be pretty "unusual", but they're not simply a fairytale inversion of human expectations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaser" title="kaser"><img alt="kaser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/686/nMCJHMAE3CEJS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaser">kaser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415251/#Comment_415251" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-01T19:34:57+00:00" title="June  1, 2013  7:34PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"Crazy" aliens are fucking stupid, and Six Inhumaniteis falls into the same category. <br/>... </blockquote>\nMind rewording that, <a href="/forums/profile/contracycle">@contracycle</a>?

The argument is that an intelligent alien needs a lot of energy to afford to support a big brain; herbivorous animals usually have an energy budget so tight they have little time or need for significant intelligence.  Hunting behaviour also requires more complex judgement an thus offers a driver for the development of greater processing power.  The cetaceans, quite like us, spend about a third of the day hunting, a third resting, and a third fooling about.<br/><br/>So, while I wouldn't rule out a non-hunting animal, or a not-very-successful hunter, I expect that they would take more work to make plausible.<br/><br/><i> I would expect that if I ever actually did run into alien life, it would be quite difficult to relate to. Having, if you'll pardon the incidental pun, developed in a vacuum as a species, humanity doesn't really have a yardstick by which to measure what is weird, beyond what we know.</i><br/><br/>Well, yes and no.  On the one hand, it would be even more extraordinarily unlikely to run into an alien species at even approximately the same technical level as us, such that any interaction is motivated or necessary, so the whole premise of meeting alien is a bit dubious, even if the universe is swarming with life.  But on the other hand, if we take as a conceit the idea that there we are dealing with species that do have such an interest, it's plausible to expect that they developed not necessarily along the same lines as us, but certainly by the same rules that we did.  The history of evolution on earth provides quite a lot of data to work with; for example, our eyes are very similar to those of octopi, but our most recent common ancestor had no eyes at all.  This pattern of eye has been invented separately at least 4 times IIRC.  Also, in the Burgess Shale there are records of a lot of very weird, to our eyes, body patterns, including hexapodal forms.  None of these have survived, however - which suggests that its a relatively poor layout and got weeded out.<br/><br/>If their evolution and ours is governed by the same rules, and we have no reason to think it wouldn't be, the it is likely that both sequences of development will stumble on similar solutions to similar problems.  Therefore it's not at all unreasonable to assume that they won't be that weird after all.  Frex, it isn't likely we will encounter aliens with the eyes on the ends of their fingers, because the longer the chain of neurons linking them to the brain the more transmission lag will be introduced.  Instead, it is much more likely that all the primary sense organs will be as close to the brain itself as can be engineered.<br/><br/><i> Speculation about alien culture has long been a staple of Sci fi, and for just that reason: we don't know what alien cultures might be like, so we have every possibility to play with.</i> <br/><br/>I don't think we have EVERY possibility, no.  Science fiction is a speculation about possible realities; it can't just be weird for weird's sake.  Not least because speculating about other cultures if they are so absurd or far out that they have no relevance to us is more or less pointless; it is neither a discussion of the possible, nor offers any illumination on our own assumptions or the like by contrast.  The fact that on Alf's home planet cats are a food delicacy is not interesting or illuminating; the fact that the Buggers in Enders Game killed humans out of hand because they didn't realise we were autonomous beings is rather more so.<br/><br/>The method mentioned above, of "tweaking, exaggerating, or reversing features" of humanity and our environment, is not IMO interesting or illuminating, or indeed SciFi at all.  It has more in common with Swiftian social criticism, which certainly has its own role.  But if the only reason you can give me for why an alien is different is "so that it can be different", I have to wonder why you bothered calling it an alien, and not Brobdingnagian or Lilliputian.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415726/#Comment_415726" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T06:58:16+00:00" title="June  8, 2013  6:58AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2013 6:58AM by Johnstone.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tell me more about alien jejune blocface.

It may be limited, but it's a lot more than one.  A LOT more.  Unless you're going to argue that there's something different about this planet, and the physical laws that apply here don't apply anywhere else.<br/><br/><i>Also, by all means, go into the desert, the jungle, the savannah, or the open ocean, and spend some time there trying not to die/get eaten.

And we aren't; any creature that has been dangerous to us has been either wiped out, or is now under our active protection.  That doesn't mean that we as individuals can never be killed by a lion or something, that still happens from time to time, but even where people live closely with dangerous animals, its an infrequent event. <br/><br/><i>Anyway, as I stated, we have very little idea what alien life *must* be like, only what it almost certainly *isn't* like, which is so broad as to be not particularly helpful (for example, it most likely can't not be made of atoms).<br/></i><br/><br/>I didn't say what it MUST be like, I simply laid out some of the thinking that goes on among scientists who think about these sort of things.  It's within the bounds of possibility that some kind of life might develop in the atmosphere of gas giants, and that would certainly be pretty "weird" from our point of view.  But you know, it might still have recognisable eyes, and it might still have a recognisable fight/flight reflex, so on and so forth.<br/><br/>You're trying to accuse me of being prescriptive, but that is not what I'm being at all - all I'm suggesting is that aliens are approached with some intelligent, science-based thinking, rather than merely relegated to being a carnival-mirror distortion of us, or a random collection of attributes without rhyme or reason to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415801/#Comment_415801" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T11:42:56+00:00" title="June  9, 2013 11:42AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2013 11:43AM by Johnstone.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's your comeback?
