The warmup up should warm up the players in more than one sense. <br/>1: It opens the players to each other, removing shyness.<br/>2: It helps set the mood for the subject matter.<br/><br/>I run a lot of games written by other people, and most have suggestions for warmup exercises. Many of them are there because the writers have been told that they need to be there, but have never really thought of what they DO.<br/><br/>A few examples: I was running Suldrup, a game about a very real murder, with one player playing the victim and the others her daughter and husband, both suspects. The game is about their lives leading up to the murder (it was never proven whether the husband or the daughter did the deed) and is a very solemn affair. Not violent. Sad, maybe. Quietly horrible.<br/>The way I ran warmup was to enter the room, lower the lights and speak softly. I had the players close their eyes and listen as I described a few facts about the murder and the family. I had them answer a simple question: Why did she have to die? And, lo and behold, they spoke respectfully in a soft voice, and even, when we were in the questions mode of play (it switched between playing out scenes and asking and answering questions) the players kept their eyes cklosed (not my intention, but it worked) and spoke softly.<br/><br/>Dulce et Decorum, a rather horrifying and wonderful WW1 storygame about life in the trenches, began with the players lying, eyes closed, on the floor, imagining various aspects of warfare, the smell of gunpowder, blood, deafening booms and such. Worked great.<br/><br/>If I run a relationship drama, my favourite warmup is having two players face one another. I give them a part and set the scene, usually "You just got home from work. Your husband's in the kitchen unpacking groceries". Then I let them play the scene, and, using bird in the ear, add a complication. Then I let them play for a minute an pull out one player (physically) and push someone into that part. I keep escalating the conflict and keep switching the players to keep them on their toes.<br/><br/>As for bad examples, I've seen them with games like the ones mentioned above, where the writer used children's games as warmup, a very common thing. Except people don't war up to the game. They may war up to each other, but not the game. Warmup should always set the mood for the subject matter, shape the mind for the theme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/olepeder" title="olepeder"><img alt="olepeder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/olepeder">olepeder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413994/#Comment_413994" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-13T07:28:32+00:00" title="May 13, 2013  7:28AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2013 7:31AM by olepeder.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the thoughts, Tore. <br/><br/>The scenario is in the Danish/Swedish freeform tradition, and I will pitch it for Danish Fastaval next year. It features a main character who has to deal with a psychiatric disorder (bipolar 1) and substance abuse (co-morbidity). There will be a warm up where the players are asked to talk about experiences with psychiatric disorders (to get them in mood/mindset for the scenario), and then the impro warm up I'm asking for help with. As the scenario involves some touching, it would be good to prepare the ground for that in the warm-up excersise. Play is physical, it's played out on the floor. Semi-larpish. That's also a reason that I want the physical impro warmup. As the content of the game is quite heavy, I'd like the warm-up to be relatively "light", without leaving the players giggling, though. Opening a safe space. Making everyone feel comfortable playing together. If you see what I'm getting at. But you may be right that it's a poor choice. Playtest will tell. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414005/#Comment_414005" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-13T10:55:23+00:00" title="May 13, 2013 10:55AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The human knot game is a nice quick game that introduces some mild touching and helps people become physically and emotionally comfortable with each other as a group.

I'm sort of infamous at fastaval for running any game I can get my hands on (I ran 10 games and 2 workshops this year), so I do have some experience in what works and what doesn't.<br/>For your game, what little I know of it, I'd say begin with describing the mental illness and how it affects people. You might get players who'd play a bipolar as a raving lunatic, because mental illness=insanity in their uninformed minds. As for touching, I usually just ask what peoples limits are, usually everyone's fine as long as there's no kissing or groping of genitals.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/olepeder" title="olepeder"><img alt="olepeder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/olepeder">olepeder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414032/#Comment_414032" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-14T01:25:39+00:00" title="May 14, 2013  1:25AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>olepeder, send me the game when you have a draft.
