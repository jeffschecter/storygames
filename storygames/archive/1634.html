<em>OK, so, the original plan was to wait until the contest was over before posting this, but by that time it seems a lot of the buzz will be gone, so I'm posting now.  Also, I'm restless.  This is about both <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/LucianSmith.pdf" rel="nofollow">the sheet</a> and <a href="http://strackenz.spod-central.org/~lpsmith/rpg/games/DangerousIdeas.html" rel="nofollow">the game</a> I entered into the contest.</em><br/><br/>When I first came across Kevin's Reverse Engineer contest (via Mike Gentry's livejournal, I believe), I had no thoughts of entering, but had great fun watching the entries as they were posted.<br/><br/>Then I suddenly had an idea.  If the point of the contest was to reverse engineer a game from a sheet, what if I took the idea one step further, and instead of submitting a set of rules for a game, I submitted a *review* of a game, and made the players reverse-engineer the game from a combination of the sheet and the 'review'?  This idea highly amused me, and I decided to go ahead and enter.  The only trick was that I had to come up with a sheet.<br/><br/>We now back up in time a bit to about a year ago.  I had been reading a few RPG design articles, and came across one by M. J. Young <a href="http://ptgptb.org/0027/theory101-02.html" rel="nofollow">decrying</a> Illusionism and Participationism.  He claimed that in such games, the players contribute nothing, only such insignificant details as the character's names.  â€œThat's the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard,â€ I thought, â€œThe character's name is unimportant?  Pfaugh.â€  But it started me thinking about all of the components of a story, which parts different people considered 'important', and who got to control what bits of the story in an RPG.  The result was my essay, â€œ<a href="http://strackenz.spod-central.org/~lpsmith/rpg/essays/ControlAndRestrictions.html" rel="nofollow">Control and Restrictions in RPGs: A mechanistic approach</a>â€.  You can go read the whole thing if you like, but the relevant aspect to this discussion is that I broke up 'story' into four bits:  'Characters', 'Setting', 'Plot', and 'Tone', and analyzed a few traditional and a few more recent games from the premise that these games parceled out control (the modern jargon for this would probably be 'authority') over these aspects to the participants in the game.  I was also laying the groundwork (at least in my own mind) for RPG design with non-traditional divisions of control.  I <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=16690.0" rel="nofollow">chatted with folks on the Forge</a> about it; we mostly talked past one another, but I had fun thinking about the ideas.<br/><br/>And here's where we fast-forward to the present again, with me trying to think of a clever idea for a character sheet.  And my thoughts when writing the essay surfaced, and I thought, â€œHey, what about an RPG where a participant is given control of the Setting much like they are usually given control of a Character?â€  I've always been intrigued by lighthouses and the activity that goes on around them, thinking that would be a great place to run a game some day.  And that was enough to crank out a sheet.  â€œOK, so I'll posit a game where at least one person mostly participates in the story by controlling the Setting axis, given the restriction that a lighthouse is central to that setting.â€  I dreamed up a few stats for the lighthouse itself, imagining ways for each that the player might have to roll dice to see if they could bring an aspect of the lighthouse to bear on the developing story (Illumination for guiding storm-tossed ships safely to their destination; Sturdiness to see if it could withstand an enormous wave; Accessibility to try to bring in help from the local town; Equipment to bring in stuff the keeper and friends could use to rescue drowning sailors.)  Other aspects of the Setting would be listed in 'Environs', which I imagined as a way for the player to both control other aspects of the setting and to control the types of stories that could be told in 'their' setting.  I imagined looser (or perhaps shared) control of the Characters in the story, each with one defining trait that the player could bring to bear on the story as it unfolded, so I added a section for that, too.<br/><br/>It was all pretty vague in my head, but the beauty of the contest was that that was all I needed.  Sketch, compile, boom, <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/LucianSmith.pdf" rel="nofollow">I'm done</a>.  Off to some poor other sucker to figure out what the heck I was thinking.<br/><br/>Amusingly, out of the 70-ish participants in the contest, the one that got my sheet was one of the three other people I knew.  Sorry, Jon!<br/><br/>Paul Czege voted my sheet 'Most Intimidating', saying, â€œEvery player is a lighthouse? And the mechanically significant details are Illumination, Sturdiness, Accessibility, and Equipment? I could do a game about the people operating a lighthouse, but the sheet doesn't really offer that option. It leaves you struggling to figure out what represents meaningful adversity for a lighthouse?â€  Someone else suggested my sheet was â€œa giant robot game waiting to happenâ€; both responses make the (sensible) assumption that my character sheet was about, well, character.  I'll probably have to write the game myself before I convince anyone you could meaningfully contribute to a story as the setting, but hey.                </div>

                            On to phase two of the contest.  After a heart-stopping moment when I thought I had been assigned <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/KristinCook.pdf" rel="nofollow">Kristin Cook's sheet</a> (William Shatner as a game-design element?  That's worse than a hot dog!) I ended up with <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/paulczege.pdf" rel="nofollow">Paul Czege's fantastic sheet</a>.  The fact that it was covered with branches all labelled 'meme' combined with a central node labelled 'Think' let me know immediately it would be a game about ideas.<br/><br/>As part of my research for the game, I googled Paul Czege, and found out he was the guy who wrote, â€œMy Life With Masterâ€, which was cool, because that game in particular I had singled out in my essay as doing unique things with player control of my four axes (as I saw it, the game system itself retains most of the control of the Plot, and places restrictions on the Setting while providing no particulars).  I also found a highly-cited post by him about â€œroleplaying's dangerous ideaâ€, which was not only a cool post, but also gave me the title for the game:  Dangerous Ideas.<br/><br/>I decided that if the game was all about ideas, the players would be the ideas themselves.  And if you're playing an idea, it doesn't really matter what the plot is (take that, M.J. Young! ;-) so I stole another idea from my essay and decided the plot would be predeterminedâ€”the players would simply retell a fairy tale or equivalent story they all already knew.  Instead of worrying about what happened in the plot, the players would influence *why* the characters did what they did.<br/><br/>So now I had the idea that on your turn, you'd try to create a new meme and write it on a meme branch.  And I suddenly got the idea, "Illuminati!"<br/><br/>Illuminati is a Steve Jackson card/money game where you play a secret cabal trying to take over the world, one group at a time.  Your cabal is represented by a card with arrows pointing out of it, and the groups are on other cards.  Then those groups can take over other groups, and so on.  You spend money to increase your chances, you get bonuses depending on the group, and then you roll 2d6 and try to get lower than you total spent+bonuses, though you always fail on an 11 or 12.  Other people can also spend money to help or hinder you.  This should start sounding familiar to those who have already read Dangerous Ideas, because I imported this mechanic wholesale into my game.<br/><br/>So now I had the basic structure for the game.  You'd gain power (instead of money) and try to create new memes.  There would be a basic strategy game you could play here with no roleplaying going on at all, but while you did that, you'd have to narrate the story.  The specifics of the story don't matter mechanically; they're there to provide color, in a way.  Or, to put it another way, the strategy game is what you do to keep your analytical mind occupied and to jump-start your creative mind telling the story.<br/><br/>I put together the game and showed it to some of my friends.  And Dan Shiovitz (who's a great friend to have to bounce ideas off of; I recommend everyone get their own Dan Shiovitz as soon as they can) liked the premise, but thought the game itself was too complicated.<br/><br/>See, at this point I had rules for everything.  I had three different things you could do on your turn that used Probe, Connect, and Create; rules for leaf and coiled memes on your turn, rules for Defend and (I think) Create when it wasn't your turn, with still other rules for leaf and coiled memes when it wasn't your turn.  There were regular bonuses and special bonuses, and rules for when a meme was held by the same character as the target vs. when the meme was held by a different character than the target, and a few other rules besides.<br/><br/>So I backed up.  I threw out one of my mechanics altogether--I was using 'Probe' to withdraw from an action and get your stones back, which necessitated keeping track of whose stones were where at all times.  Throwing this out resulted in the much cleaner mechanic of there being only one pool of stones during an action.  We batted around ideas for something else for 'Probe' to do, when finally I had it--you'd use Probe and Create on your turn, and Defend and Connect when it was someone else's turn.  That even made it nicely symmetrical on the sheet, with your turn's actions on the vertical axis and other people's turns' actions on the horizontal axis.<br/><br/>I also simplified what the leaf and coiled memes meant--leaf memes could help Create and Connect, while coiled memes could help Defend and Probe.  I made up some excuse for this in the game text, but the true reason here was game balance.  I didn't want there to be an obvious strategy where leaf memes were obviously better than coiled memes, or visa versa.  Since 'Create' was inherently more powerful than 'Probe', I connected Create to the action that helps other people (Connect) via the leaf memes, and Probe to the action that hinders other people (Defend) via the coiled memes.  That way, if you stocked up on leaf memes, you could only help other people, not to mention being vulnerable to others actions against you.  Optimal strategy would (I hoped) involve both leaf and coiled memes.<br/><br/>About this time I finally rounded up a couple people to playtest the thing.  Dan was in for it, as was Jota.  And together we told the story of the Three Little Pigs, trying to warp it so that it was really all about The Wonders of Modern Technology, or possibly Aliens Are Around Us, or maybe even The Attitude of Cats.  And it was fun!  Jota in particular really liked the game, seeing through it instantly to what it really was:  the veneer of a strategy game that's actually there to inspire creativity.<br/><br/>A few tweaks to the rules as suggested by the playtest, and I had a playable game!<br/><br/>Of course, by this point, I had learned that writing clear, concise rules is hard--I don't think any of them survived their initial write-up without confusing at least one person.  So the prospect of trying to re-write the whole thing as a review, with only elliptical references to the rules was pretty daunting, and I didn't do it.  Maybe next time.  <br/><br/>Instead, I took the time to write a thorough play example to parallel the rules so people could see what was supposed to be going on.  I think this helped immensely--the gimmick would have been fun, but in the end, this was time better spent.<br/><br/>Finally, I got another friend (Jennifer Earl) who is into both RPGs and graphic design to make it look nice.  Nothing fancy, just some layout and choosing a decent font.  We worked back and forth on the HTML version a fair amount, and then threw together the PDF at the last minute, which was a bit unfortunate since it meant that the HTML was great but the PDF had a couple glitches, but on the whole, everything worked out.<br/><br/>So, thanks Kevin!  It was a blast.                        </div>
