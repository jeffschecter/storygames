They went to the same high school and only one of them was necessarily a "gamer", the other two, both girls, were there because their dads brought them to the con.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the players were looking over all five characters, the two girls told me straight out that they'd never played a tabletop RPG before. One of them said she'd never even played a computer RPG of any kind (the other said she'd played lots of World of Warcraft... she also picked Naomi Bishop, but I don't judge!). The guy picked Snargle. The non-RPG girl expressed interest in Arkam, but she was hesitant until I told her some people have played that character as a girl, so she chose Arkam and called her Cally.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game was a blast. They really got into it. We played three and a half hours and they actually got Lady Blackbird to the Pirate King.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could bore you with the details, but I want to talk about my two favorite moments of the game session, both are related.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd introduced this six and a half foot tall NPC elf that someone called Squiggy in a scene in an underground den. When Snargle tries to get the mob boss to show him the True Path to the Remnants, he's pointed to Squiggy. Squiggy and Snargle head back to the hangar bay of The Owl so Snargle can learn how to navigate to the Pirate King. Then Arkam and Naomi, who had been off doing their own thing, come into the hangar bay together.<br/>\n<br/>\n* I point to WoW girl and tell her, "You come in and see this willowy elf that you recognize from the pits. You know him by the tattoos of a swarm of hornets on his left arm leading to the tips of his fingers and especially because of that pick he has slung on his back. He told you it was the jawbone of some wild animal he killed and you know its hollowed out and holds poison in it. You know this because that's the weapon he used to kill your best friend, your *only* friend in the pits. It was the last time you saw him... until now."<br/>\n* I point to non-RPG girl and I hesitate for a second and on a whim, I pull the Mountain Witch trick on her. I say, "They're calling this guy Squiggy, but that's not really his name. You know him as Quinn and the last time you saw him, something bad happened... what was it?"<br/>\nShe blinks for a second but I can see her brain working. She blurts out, "Oh yeah, I know him, way back before he was a pit fighter with Naomi we ran around together. We tried to pull a big heist, but it got messed up. We both ran off, but he got caught and I left him behind."<br/>\nI got all excited and say, "And that's how he ended up in the pits, wasn't it?" Non-RPG girl nods with a smile.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Squiggy/Quinn hadn't seen the two of them enter, engrossed as he was with all his maps. They call Snargle over and tell him to get Squiggy out of there, which he does. But Snargle doesn't do a great job of it, telling Squiggy that his mechanic Cally needs to get some work done on The Owl so they have to find somewhere else to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo fast forward a bit. They're still on Haven, its the next day and they wake up under the shadow of the Hand of Sorrow. Vance tells Snargle to make a break for it. Naomi hops in the gun turret while they take off and she fires on the Hand and several biplanes. During the escape, the ship is rocked with cannon fire and Cally is back in the engine room trying to patch things together. Out of nowhere she is clocked on the back of the head and falls to the ground. She turns over to see Quinn standing over her holding his pick, murder in his eyes. He starts yelling at her over the din, How could you leave me behind? Do you know the things I had to do to survive?!? You left me to DIE!!?!"<br/>\n<br/>\nWoW Girl gets all worked up, asking me over and over, "Do I hear this? Do I hear it?" I let the ranting from Quinn continue for a bit, he kicks Cally again and she fails to dodge so she takes an injured condition. Non-RPG Girl is looking a bit sick at the moment. Kid playing Snargle starts asking, "Do I hear this at all?" Everyone is leaning forward in their chairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI switch over to Snargle, give him an Extreme roll to get them out of the thick of things. He blows a bunch of his Pool and makes the roll. I tell him as he is pulling out of Haven's atmosphere, things quieten and then he overhears a scuffle somewhere back in hold or something. Snargle turns on the intercom system. I tell Naomi that as the gun fire becomes more distant, she hears Squiggy yelling from the engine room.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow Girl looks at me with these burning eyes and declares, "I'm hopping out of the turret and I'm going down there right NOW!"<br/>\n<br/>\nKid playing Snargle looks at Vance in the co-pilot seat and says, "Can you check that out?" I mimic Vance getting up and checking his twin guns in their holster and he says with bravado, "Keep us flying, I'll take care of it."<br/>\n<br/>\nCut to the engine room, Cally has tried crawling around, but she knows she isn't much of a fighter. Naomi comes rushing in and Squiggy/Quinn turns around with a look of surprise, "Bishop! What the Blue are you doing here?"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe WoW Girl starts moving in between Squiggy/Quinn and Cally and she's a living weapon, so she's ready to throw down, "Tell me this, elf. Why did you do it? Why did you kill her? Did you mean to poison her?"<br/>\n<br/>\nHe replies with surprise, "I did it so I would live. You and I both know that's why. I did things, we *both* did things, we didn't want to do. But it was me or her and I knew she was a better fighter. I mean, YOU trained her, you knew it, too. What was I supposed to do?"<br/>\n<br/>\nWoW Girl blinks, she's processing this now, she's not sure where to take it, but she doesn't break character. She's dialed in and so am I. She changes tact, "I'm not going to let you kill *her*," indicating Cally.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I hit her full on with what I've been waiting to do. I come back at her, actually pointing straight at her as I say, "She left me to the Empire. She left me to rot in the pits. All I want is my vengeance. Its my RIGHT!" Both girls' eyes go wide. I lean forward and speak slow but deliberate, "If you had your chance to take it, wouldn't you do the same?!?"<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's when WoW Girl's mouth gapes open. She breaks character and looks straight at non-RPG Girl, "It IS what I would do. I killed those guards earlier because I have this Key of Vengenace. I've totally been doing this!" She looks at her character sheet, then back at me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've also broken character and I look at her with a wry smile, "It isn't the only choice you can make... is it?"<br/>\n<br/>\n"No, it isn't!" She blurts out, "I can buy it off. Oh this is perfect!" She kind of shifts her shoulders, like she's fallen back into character and I do the same. She says to Squiggy/Quinn, "You shouldn't do this. I did it, it didn't make things better. It won't fix anything... no, if I were you, I would not do this."<br/>\n<br/>\nSquiggy/Quinn cocks his head, then relaxes a bit and says simply, "You wouldn't would you? You really mean it. Maybe I..." I leave that sentence unfinished then I start yelling, "Blam! Blam! Blam! Three shots ring out, echoing in the engine room You see the first shot from Vance hits Squiggy square in the eyes, the other two throw his back back and he falls to the grated metal floor with a flop, dead."<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth girls look at me with horror. With my half-Han Solo, half-Ashe from Army of Darkness Vance impression, I say, "What? I heard it on the intercom, he was going to kill Cally. I SAVED you! ... didn't I?"<br/>\n<br/>\nyeah, that was frigging fun.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330356/#Comment_330356" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T21:10:36+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  9:10PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2011 9:14PM by nemomeme.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Buyoff for the win!

It was interesting. At first, they yelled at Vance, but he kept telling them he overheard the fight on the intercom and came running down to help. Eventually, they dropped it, but it was obvious they were both upset.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater when Snargle had to make a roll to take the True Path (he bought the secret by this point), the girls make a crack about how they wish the guy who taught Snargle would be here to help them out, going back and forth about it and "looking at Vance".<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto, I'm not great at guessing ages, but I know all three of them went to the same high school. I think one of them said she was a junior.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a complete aside, I am planning on running Lady Blackbird at a mini-con next weekend at my friendly local game shop. I decided to get a prop and asked Arnold (Harlequin above in the thread) where I could find some steampunk goggles. He directed me to a local costume shop.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took my five and a half year old son out for Free RPG Day today, he bought a Tiny Titans comic, I picked up my two allotted free RPGs (DCC and Dragon Age), then we swung over to the costume shop. I found some nice steampunky goggles and a second pair of sort of post apoc jet black goggles. My son insisted we buy both and who was I to argue?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we're heading out of the store, he begs to open one, puts it on. Then he hands me the other, tells me I should put them on. I do so, because we're just driving home, right? Then my wife calls and asks me to stop by the grocery store. I pull in and park, start to take off my goggles. My son asks me to keep them on. I think about it, then I do. Then we walked about the grocery store with our steampunky goggles for half an hour, getting lots of odd looks. Luckily, he's adorable, so he pulled it off and I rode his coattails.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
