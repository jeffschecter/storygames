I can't seem to get any attention or critiques on this, so I hoped you friendly folks might be able to spend a few moments of your time to aid hopeful game designer.<br/>-------<br/><br/>After a year of setting it aside, I've been inspired by the Ashcan Project to return to Sudden Light (if your search-fu is strong, you can find my old posts on the topic). You can download the (very rough) <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/ethics/Sudden_Light.001.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF version of it here.</a><br/><br/>In basic form, this is what I submitted for my Improv and Creative Writing class mentioned in the original threads (I got an A, BTW!)<br/><br/>Again, it is very rough. Please understand that it has not been playtested in any way shape or form. If anyone here wants to give it a go with two other friends and report back, I'd be eternally grateful. There would be beer at Gen Con involved. Copious amounts.<br/><br/>However, as I realize this is a big commitment to ask at such a preliminary stage, I'd ask that you simply spend a few minutes looking it over. Any feedback would be incredibly helpful; I realize I should avoid this generality, so here are a few things I'm looking for:<br/><br/>-In your opinion, do the mechanics reinforce the theme?<br/>-What assumptions do you think are at work in the text that I haven't explicitly addressed?<br/>-Is the text convoluted? Can you understand what I'm trying to express in broad strokes?<br/>-Any grammar or syntax problems?  Are there any stylistic changes that you would make?<br/>-What about the examples of play? Did they help to illustrate game principles? How might they be improved?<br/>-After a quick glance, might you be interested in giving the game a shot? If not, how could I reel you in?<br/>-What needs to be cut or what sections might you want to see expanded?<br/>-Might you have alternative names for elements of gameplay that would be more evocative than mine?<br/>-In your own brutal estimation, do you think this embryonic text has potential for enjoyable gameplay?<br/><br/>Any other comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciation. Critiques are especially welcomed.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Zach                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75250/#Comment_75250" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T02:11:13+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  2:11AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have infinite reading time.

I want to explore the many things that we have in our lives (books, lovers, memories, etc.) that can help us realize profound truths and see though the mundane that surrounds us and holds most people down. If you had the choice, would you choose the comfortable life of a lie or would you want the the harsh reality, no matter what the cost?<br/><br/>The game originated as an attempt to capture the feel of TV's Rescue Me (especially Season Two) and the themes of addiction and redemption. As I worked on it, I begin to blend themes from the Matrix, Plato's the Cave, Marxism, philosophy, and critical theory. As such, it's a setting-less game meant to take on the themes of revelations and bondage to the world. Although this could be done easily in a religious sense, it could do the Matrix as well: goal of the game is to see if the Protagonist will choose to pierce Lie of the Machine to see the Truth, or will choose to embrace the lie of banality. If you want to know what I mean by those terms, you have to read the text!  :-)<br/><br/>Here's the first paragraph of the game:<br/><br/>"Sudden Light is a interactive storytelling game designed for three players. While the<br/>mechanics of this game maintain the role of the GM (called Guides throughout this text), Sudden<br/>Light inverts the traditional player-GM dichotomy used by most role-playing games. Instead of<br/>multiple players playing different characters with a singular GM, Sudden Light uses two GM's<br/>with a single player acting out the role of a lone Protagonist. This game also introduces an<br/>element of competition between these GMs, as each represent a force attempting to seduce a<br/>singular individual toward their domain. These Guides, in Sudden Light, become the better<br/>angels or the base desires of the Protagonist, pushing her toward or drawing her away from,<br/>encountering the Truth of the setting."<br/><br/>The Guides are basically angels and demons sitting on the arms of the Protagonist. I basically took the idea of the character sheet, cut it down the middle, and gave each half to the Guides, whereas the Protagonist only has the characteristic of Will. I've always been fascinated by the fetters from Wraith: the Oblivion, so I decided to make important factors that influence the Protagonist (addictions, children, love, revenge, etc.), give them to two competing GM's, let the factors clash and compete, and see whether the Protagonist chooses to transcend his or her status quo, or chooses the easy and comfortable Lie.<br/><br/>Ok, that's the short "elevator speech" meant to encourage you to click on the free download. I hope it worked<br/><br/>Wow...feels really weird to be make a "selling" speech for my own game.  It makes me feel...all tingly inside.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
