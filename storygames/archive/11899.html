I asked a player in <i>Cthulhutech</i> in the process of becoming a tager.<br/><br/>'7,' he said, just as another player said: 'You can't answer him'.<br/><br/>(You need an 8 to successfully complete the tager ritual).<br/><br/>Even as a twelve-year-old, I knew you didn't share mechanical details with other players. Your character wouldn't know, so why should you?<br/><br/>But in most story games, I'd happily share that information player-to-player. If a character is heading towards horrific failure in the tager ritual, I'd expect the player and the group to know it and welcome it.<br/><br/>My story gaming instinct arose in other circumstances too. I was reluctant to spend drama points, because failing was more interesting than succeeding. But because of Cthulhutech's play style, that hesitation let down my team. <br/><br/>So my question to you is, do you play like a story gamer in traditional games? Do you have to consciously resist the urge to do so? Or do you embrace it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265703/#Comment_265703" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T22:12:52+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 10:12PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2010 10:13PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sanglorian</cite>Even as a twelve-year-old, I knew you didn't share mechanical details with other players.

You're playing the wizard, you talk about what your spell choices are and the new cheesy technique you thought up for using <i>Levitate</i> as an offensive spell.  You're playing Cyberpunk, you talk about how much damage your SMG does and how your cybereyes let you see a fly half a mile away in pitch darkness.  You talk about how many dots of Celerity you have.  You compare your PC's skill bonuses with the other players so that you all know who's going to be making the roll to investigate the crime scene or talk the jumper off the ledge or whatever.<br/><br/>In the "traditional games" of my youth, you shared mechanical details all the damn time...because mechanical details are fun, because sharing them is part of the experience, because it's a point of comparison, because it's a convenient conversational hook to hang your discussion of the game on, because it helps you learn how the system works, because you're sharing best practices.  Plus, you've got a shitload more mechanical details to talk about than you would in, say, Primetime Adventures or IAWA or whatever.<br/><br/>I'm honestly baffled that your upbringing was so utterly alien.

I like it when I know how a given game works, and I approach each game from a clean table without bringing in any preconceptions. This is methodology learned from having my trad experience overturned by the Forge a few years (damn close to a decade, actually) ago, basically, after which I learned to look at games from ground up instead of just a superficial view. I don't like games that resist this sort of comprehensive analysis by being incomplete or incoherent; I need to craft my own theory as to which of the possible complete games implied by the text I'm going to execute before I can play a game like that. For complex games this is often a process that might take actual play to complete, but usually I know after a session or two at the latest what I want to do with a given game, if anything. After that it's all just execution.<br/><br/>The above means that just like I don't really have a problem with bringing trad assumptions to indie games, I don't have indie assumptions in trad games, or in OSR games or in anything in general. I just try to read each game as its own thing and do what it tells me to do, interpreting as necessary. It's notable that this doesn't mean that I can't benefit from using a wide variety of techniques; many games involve wide leeway in player or GM roles and the tools used in executing them, for which reason you can also import tools and technique from one game to another. A classical example is importing explicit conflict resolution via task resolution; it works in almost all skill based task resolution games. Open OOC, relationship mapping, bangs, scene framing... there's a long list of techniques that are actively beneficial for many games that never mention such things themselves (often because the game writing paradigm of the time didn't involve real and useful GMing advice, note).<br/><br/>One thing about importing technique between traditions that I find annoying is when people treat games interchangeably as identical with each other. If this technique was a good idea in one game, it's going to be a good idea in every game, amirite? I actually bitched about this <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/the-pitfalls-of-narrative-technique-in-rpg-play/" rel="nofollow">at my blog</a> a while back, writing about misapplied narration sharing that seems to come up now and then. Being used to playing in a specific way is a poor excuse for drifting games in my experience, not the least because that sort of inflexibility when taken to extremes can make you pretty poor company at a mixed table of play when you end up playing a game that doesn't work like your only number. I'm reminded of how one in ten roleplayers seem constitutionally unable to play <i>Zombie Cinema</i>, a game that otherwise has a pretty good track record; they just don't have the tools for shifting out of their usual perspective, so they play every game like it was GURPS (seems to correlate <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265712/#Comment_265712" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T22:55:35+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 10:55PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Virtually all "trad" (ecchth thptoo, that WORD, ashes in the mouth) games can very easily be played as story games, and they have been for years. 12 year old JD's D&amp;D game was a story - a story that a 12 year old boy might write, full of puns and violence and improbably arranged women.

And often people who play Story Games are people who GM Trad games.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course there are many reasons for this, people who are attracted to the GM role may be attracted to Story Games. They are likely more exposed to gaming in general, doing more research online and thus have more of an opportunity to experience different styles. Many of the GMs I know tend to go to more conventions, and play with more people. And when they aren't GMing, they may want to play games that give them part Trad GM authority even in a player role.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone who GMs a lot (easily 1-3 times a week, for 50+ different people a year) GMing has made it difficult for me to just be a player. When I play, I much prefer Story Games. As a player, I want to be able to describe my success or failure, I want to scene frame where appropriate, I want to talk out of character when clear communication is necessary, I want failure to push the game forward, I don't want to have to find the fun or read the GM's mind to figure out what to do next, I want my character details to be important to the plot, and I want equal spotlight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dungeon Master Guide has advice to incorporate these styles of play into Trad games like D&amp;D.; But procedurally they aren't hard coded into the main system or supported by examples in many popular modules. There is nothing stopping you from incorporating these elements. And there is advice on how to do so. But their inclusion is unreliable and group specific. Which is why this becomes a big issue at conventions playing with strangers. I won't play D&amp;D; at a con. It's too random what play style you will get.

But it seems to me that some of your techniques are actually house rules. When you say 'explicit conflict resolution via task resolution', can you explain what you mean? If I understand you correctly, that sounds like you're deviating substantially from the rules of most games (what I'm imagining is negotiating the stakes between player and GM).</blockquote>\nJoshua touched on this in passing: many story game techniques are not incompatible with traditional games. Conflict resolution is one such example: the majority of traditional game design does not prevent you from using the task resolution system to resolve conflicts; in fact, I expect that even if the texts are woefully deficient in enforcing it, many of these designers would have expected you to do exactly that. I basically base this supposition on the fact that there are just two common and intuitive ways of using task resolution systems:\n<ul>\n<li>The GM calls for a task resolution check with the full intent to have this matter and a firm understanding of what are the consequences of victory or loss. This is conflict resolution, it just happens to resolve the conflict by consulting a specific task resolution, or perhaps a string of such. Many traditional games basically assume that you're going to play like this; I can't name any specific game that would've expounded on the importance of fairness in task resolution in length, but that's because it's sort of obvious for anybody immersed in playing like that to begin with.</li>\n<li>The GM calls for task resolutions as a matter of pacing, illusionism and giving the players something to do. The results of the check are used according to GM whim and the situation: the task resolution is <i>called</i> according to objective criteria ("whenever the character does something"), but the outcome only influences the events insofar as the GM can still narrate the game to remain within his design spec for the scenario. This isn't explicit conflict resolution (conflicts still get resolved, that dice rolling just has little to do with it), but it certainly is common advice in mainstream games, especially after 1990. Basically any game that characterizes the GM as a storyteller and mandates him to entertain the whole group of players advices you to play like this.</li>\n</ul>\nIt is notable that the two attitudes above are just methodical advice for the GM in mainstream games; there is no game system element to it, both of those attitudes can be accomplished without deviating from the procedures and mechanics of the GM role. Specifically, you can easily do conflict resolution in traditional games: some of them actively assume it (I think - as I mention above, I suspect that any game that doesn't specifically advocate GM cheating is really just assuming effective task/conflict conflation), while others don't, but they can still be turned around simply by disregarding the GMing <i>advice</i> and reinventing the means you use to fulfill the duty. I don't think that the latter is changing the game; the GM has a degree of freedom in his choices just like the players do, and if a given GM decides that he's not going to cheat on the dice rolls, it'd be pretty far-fetched to decide that he's no longer playing the same game.<br><br>As a simple example, I noticed while reading the newest edition of the Warhammer RPG (the boardgamey one) that the GMing advice in the GM's book is firmly illusionist: according to the book your job is to provide a Warhammer experience, and you do it by cheating on the dice and doing whatever else it takes to create a specific play experience for the players. Considering that the game <i>also</i> includes a seemingly complete and functional game, should I consider that verbiage in the GM's book to be systematic, or merely advice? It seems to me that many ignore that text and still "play Warhammer", so perhaps it's more along the lines of advice: this is the way the designer recommends for you to fulfill your GM role, but if you can hack it without cheating, that's an option, too. Interpreting that text as mandatory makes the game's design incoherent (for one, it requires you to break the rules it presents), so even if I consider the GM's book as authoritative as any procedural rules in the game, then I still have to choose which rules I'm going to follow in playing the game. If I decide to accord more importance to the rules everybody uses while only paying lip service to the rules that only concern the GM, I don't think that that's something you could call a house rule - I'm just doing my best to understand the game text and implement a coherent game out of it; it's not the only coherent alternative reading, but it's an option.<br><br>The above explains my justification for seeing conflict resolution in a game like MERP or D&amp;D or such, I think. If you're wondering about my use of the word "explicit", then consider this: just as the rules of most games do not mandate you to hide your character sheet from the other players, likewise they do not say that the GM should hide the reasons for dice rolling. In the vast majority of traditional games it is entirely reasonable to go into a dice roll by saying that "Bob, it seems to me that your captive might get away here. Do by all means make a knot-tying skill check to see if he might've escaped into the night while you were asleep." That's explicit conflict resolution, no doubt about it. Going explicit is usually a good idea because the game is more fun when the other players can enjoy what is going on as well when you demand for dicing, and it also allows the other players to interrupt and give input into your conflict pacing choices. Finally, being explicit about why you're rolling the dice is useful because it keeps the GM honest and prevents him from accidentally shifting the goal posts once he's seen the outcome. I have this habit in playing D&amp;D that I forbid the players from rolling the dice before I've spoken the target number out loud; I don't necessarily tell them in D&amp;D why they're rolling, but I insist that the dice roll doesn't count if I see the result before I've spoken a string of rules-legalese against which it'll be compared. That's explicitness in action, but it's still not a game-system issue - I'm just describing GMing technique here, not mandating procedures for how the game is played. Traditional games just have such wide leeway in how you can do the GMing that you can import many, many techniques without changing the system of the game one bit. That's even a reasonable description of traditional game design: you need to have a big, fat lacuna in the place where the game might be expected to tell you specifically what to do to achieve the adventure, just so every GM can slot in their own approach.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265779/#Comment_265779" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T10:39:21+00:00" title="April  6, 2010 10:39AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

My regular gaming group spends about half our time playing the New Hippie Shit, and about half our time playing Shelf Classics with All Those Story Games Tools to Get to the Point (Castle Falkenstein, L5R, with Blue Planet and Vampire somewhere on the horizon). So for us, we do That with This and have awesome success.<br/><br/>But failure stories are fun, too. I don't have any that I can easily recall. As a player, I've never been in that sort of culture clash situation. <br/><br/>As a GM, I DEFINITELY have brought this hippie fire storm down on unsuspecting players. In each case, the results have been positive. <br/><br/>Quick example:<br/>Me, GMing D&amp;D 3e a few years back. Alan is playing a rogue. We are in an abandoned, ancient fortress.<br/>ALAN: I search around the broken, ruined bed frames again.<br/>(I notice this is the third time he's doing this in about 10 minutes)<br/>ANDY: OK, noted. You don't find anything.<br/>ALAN: OK.<br/>ANDY: BTW, What are you looking for, anyway?<br/>ALAN: Anything unusual, out of the ordinary.<br/>ANDY: I mean, you yourself: What are you hoping your character finds? <br/>ALAN: Well, he's just looking for something unusual.<br/>ANDY: I get that, but what are YOU having him look for? It sounds like you have something in mind?<br/>ALAN: (not wanting to step out of the character's pants, after some hemming and hawing) Well, I was thinking that maybe somewhere around here there might be some kind of historic tome or something that explained what happened to the people here.<br/>(And yes, he would have been totally happy just doing Search rolls, not finding anything, describing searching to no avail, and moving on to do it again 5 minutes later; to him it was simply a question of finding what the GM prepared for him, and not about suggesting things to happen in the game world)<br/>ANDY: Huh. Interesting idea.<br/><br/>At this point, I know Alan from experience is big into verisimilitude in the setting, so I don't say, "Oh, great idea! Yeah I'll just make that shit up now!", even though I literally had no such ideas to put a history/past into this quick dungeon. So instead, I come up with some elements in my head, and about two rooms later I have some partially hidden tapestries that show pictures of some sort of giant exodus: Alan feels vindicated in his searching, he gets to see what he really wanted to see, the veil of verisimilitude remains, and I get to use his feedback to make the adventure that much more interesting, and appeal to the players.<br/>Note that this was something like... 7 years ago? Within one year we had all dropped that veil to get straight to the meat:<br/><br/>ALAN: I strike up a conversation with that guard. *I'm wondering if he has any opinion on the princess.*<br/>ANDY: (Aha! He certainly does now!)<br/>(roleplaying in character between character and NPC commences)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265781/#Comment_265781" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T10:44:11+00:00" title="April  6, 2010 10:44AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD's assertion that there is no difference between how his 12 year old self ran D&amp;D and how I run, say, Sorcerer is absurd.  So I'm going to answer your question more honestly.<br/><br/>My answer: Yes.  My biggest success was with running 7th Sea.  I did have to do a few things.<br/><br/>1) I hardly ever rolled anything against a static TN.  If it was an action that normally required a static TN it was usually something just worth saying yes to.  This had a tendency to devalue certain skills.  Basically, simply having the skills became narrative justification for taking certain actions and little else so there was no point to advancing them.<br/><br/>3) By consequence 99% of all rolls were opposed and thus were moments of conflict resolution between characters in motion.<br/><br/>2) I dumped all the Heroes out of the setting.  I told the players that any character in the setting material classified as a Hero exists if you want to take advantage of them as a resource but I as a GM will, never introduce or use them on my own.  Interestingly enough, the PCs never once called on them.<br/><br/>3) I had to completely change the Healing rules.  The Healing rules in 7th Sea assume you know what the "Act Structure" of your game looks like.  Since it's impossible to discern the act structure of this style of play except in hindsight, I often had to just "eye ball it" which I hated doing but there really was no other way.<br/><br/>4) The Reputation rules move too slowly relative to the action in the game.  When one scene can completely change agenda/allegiance of an NPC to the degree that it became absurd to apply the Villain rules to them or when the Hero because acting on so many complex shades of grey naively referring to them as a Hero was silly.  Similarly a minor character would suddenly take on VAST importance such that mechanically treating them as a Brute or Henchman was absurd despite them not accumulating enough XP to promote themselves.  In short the whole Brute, Henchman, Hero, Villain distinction simply broke down relative to their emotional value in the fiction.<br/><br/>5) Even with all that I found myself backed into a lot of mechanical corners.  At one point, one of the players took on the Schattenman from Eisen... who has no stats because he's clearly meant to be a GM Fiat machine.  I literally had no way to properly adjudicate what should have been a rather tense and complex conflict.  It was very frustrating.<br/><br/>Outside of those kinks and hiccups though the game worked relatively well about 80% of the time.  It's just sad that the 20% that failed were often the most emotionally engaging or intense moments.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265790/#Comment_265790" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T11:32:49+00:00" title="April  6, 2010 11:32AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2010 11:34AM by Andy.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>JD's assertion that there is no difference between <b>how his 12 year old self</b> ran D&amp;D and <b>how I run</b>, say, Sorcerer is absurd</blockquote>\nJust note: He wasn't talking about you (individually or collectively): His examples were both about <b>himself</b>, revealing only about how <b>he</b> plays...<br/>Just sayin'.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265802/#Comment_265802" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T13:23:58+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  1:23PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I do think that both approaches are about story, aiming at or experiencing narrative in some way.

Puns and violence is no way to be a decent wizard when you're 35, even though they are sufficient to sustain a Piers Anthony fantasy series for young teenage boys for a ridiculous amount of years...My D&amp;D story gaming was fit for who I and my friends were - 12-13 year old boys.  To expect a 13 year old boy to be interested in or capable of producing a mature story exploring (for example) romance and the corruption of power is not to expect too much of the game, but to expect too much of the boy.<br/><br/>But your description of what you experienced with 7th Sea is very much like what I've seen many others that value story do with that game, and pretty close to how I handled it. I instinctively don't ever use "GM fiat monsters" for just the reason you describe - once you have convinced everyone to engage with a system as a means of fleshing out the fiction, it does nobody any good to throw the system out and try to bypass it. Also, I have had the same experience you had with "Heroes" in other settings/systems. Nobody cares that Elminster exists if they have their own problems and goals.  It's not that they have some positive or negative view of him, it just doesn't come up.

For my part, I totally do exactly this, grouping those games together: my understanding of the textual history of rpgs is that there is a discrete tradition beginning with the first games and spanning almost everything written until late '90s, at which point postmodernism hits and people start going back to basics to really critically repurpose the whole exercise. The distinction between traditional and progressive design is important, because the traditional texts rely on a common understanding of prior art - sometimes a mistaken assumption, but often a powerful short-hand when both sides of the communication really do conform to the same assumptions. This is just a historical analysis, not an absolute deductive property of game texts, note: there have been out-of-tradition design in all decades and there still is a lot of traditional design, but I think that it's quite feasible to claim that what once was absolutely dominant (the one tradition) is today much less so. I try to avoid using a term like "story game" in ways that encompass games from both sides of this divide because for most topics it'd just be confusing; the games have so little in common as culture that the similarities are accidental rather than systematic transferrence, as is the case within the tradition.<br/><br/>In case it interests anybody, my understanding of history is that we took up progressive design largely because '90s traditional game design amply demonstrated to us the limits of the tradition: D&amp;D-derived assumptions about character ownership, character optimization, challenge-gaming, party-based adventuring and other things, while powerful for their own culture, proved a crucial limitation for getting into the pure-bred story game that many of us looked for and had futilely tried to accomplish within the tradition. The tradition had to be broken with to get into design space that couldn't be reached within it.<br/><br/>(I should note that "the tradition" I discuss above is not the only subculture that could be viewed as a tradition in a historiographical sense. Forge is totally a tradition at this point, transmitting its own verbiage and viewpoints that are useful in understanding Forge-based game texts. Nordics have their own tradition, too, and wargaming has a tradition that sometimes steps into rpg land. D&amp;D is a tradition that can well be interpreted as separate from the generic big tradition, as there are plenty of people who only play D&amp;D and preserve D&amp;D-specific culture; the OSR is a powerful example of a D&amp;D-based tradition, for instance.)<br/><br/>My own experience in light of the above viewpoints is that it's eminently reasonable to not get stuck on the word "story" and insist that all games with story are "story games" when other people are obviously (obvious to me, anyway) using the term as a vague shorthand for a certain type of progressive gaming. This thread doesn' t even make any sense if you refuse to accept for the sake of discussion this usage - if a traditional game also is a story game as the OP intends, then the question of whether you can use story gaming techniques in trad games is trivial and no discussion is necessary. I do accept that the historical root of the term "story game" is in Andy specifically wanting to focus on story as a goal instead of historical or analytic traits of games - he could have called this the "progressive games forum" or whatever if he wanted to limit it to Forge-style games, that's clear enough. However, others use the term differently, and especially in combination with the term "trad gaming" it only makes sense to understand "story game" as pointing towards "Forge-style progressive school gaming" instead of just vaguely any story-related gaming at all. I don't mean that everybody everywhere forever needs to use the term in this sense (I think that "story game" is very useful as a goal-related term that transcends historical traditions), but in this case the OP wants to speak of tradition-crossing, so insisting that his choice of words doesn't depict any traditions seems obfuscatory.<br/><br/>To say the above in a more compact form: Jason, if you don't play the games Chris means in his OP, don't appreciate the unique approaches in those games and don't believe that they are essentially different from traditional games, and don't even believe in the existence of a meaningful tradition, then how are you even engaging Chris's question? It seems that you're not entertaining his premises at all here, but rather complaining about them. I don't think that you're necessarily wrong (although my own understanding of the historical topic, as outlined above, is different), but wouldn't this be better as a new thread that can give justice to the complex issue you've raised?

I would, of course, being as to how this particular understanding of rpg history is important for my own ability to make sense of the hobby. But still, why be bothered by my need to engage in rpg text critique and historical analysis? I think that I do pretty good work in my actual play and design, and scholarly study of historical rpg texts definitely has a place in that. One of the fruits is this idea that we can talk about traditions, their assumptions and groups of games wider than just one game line. This in turn has many benefits, including our ability to read game texts efficiently and correctly when we know what they assume of the reader.<br/><br/>In other words, it seems to me that we would be less efficient in communication if we didn't have the concept of "traditional game" to fall back on. It'd come up all the time when doing historical analysis, in fact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265818/#Comment_265818" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T15:21:51+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  3:21PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think motivations vary and there certainly are good ones.  But there are also negative ones.  I think the problem with this kind of classification by system is that it amplifies one factor and makes it paramount and thus paints a very distorted picture of what is actually a very complex and varied history.  So while I agree that it is very helpful to have a baseline definition for certain things, I think the current dogma of what traditional gaming is as used here is fundamentally incorrect and reductivist.  So instead of using the word traditional gaming as a foundation for further clarification, it instead becomes a political tool for furthering certain agendas and assumptions that, I believe, are damaging to the hobby.<br/><br/>I am not capable of answering the question of the OP, as interpreted by Joshua AC Newman because in my own gaming community, we just don't have the same assumptions about what traditional gaming is.  I try and think when was a time when there may have been a conflict of play styles based on these two reductivist extremes (story vs. gamer) and I can't because it's always been a constant flow, whether we are playing GURPS or Savage Worlds or Reign or Unknown Armies or Beat to Quarters or Dirty Secrets or Dogs in the Vineyard or SotC or Inspectres.  Yes, each game is approached differently based on its text, but nobody is coming from one solid position or another so that they can suddenly find this obvious point of conflict, such as "Oh my god you as a player are trying to introduce elements in areas that are strictly the GMs domain!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265819/#Comment_265819" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T15:24:32+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  3:24PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I agree with what you said.  But I will back up JD's complaint to a point.  I think the REAL "traditions" are not often accurately described.  The terms "traditional" and "indie" are often used at best to simply mean pre-Forge influence and post-Forge influence and worst as social weapons much the same way I criticism the word "fun" as being used as a social weapon.<br/><br/>For example, I'm not really comfortable lumping GURPS in with Vampire.  Nor am I comfortable lumping FATE in with My Life with Master.<br/><br/>I think discussing REAL traditions would be an extremely interesting and fruitful thing as I think it would illuminate some of the more positive aspects of older designs.

I might even say that people who choose to use this sort of terminology self-select in a manifold of ways. For instance, it seems pretty obvious to me that Forge has attracted people through this decade with specific virtues, one of which is clarity in design and play methodology that leads to functional, dramatic narrativism. In this context it's not surprising that the people who are most impressed by the achievements of the Forge culture are often the ones who experienced typical '90s game design as a disappointment. Among this subset of hobbyist it's easy to speak of "traditional gaming" and expect a similar understanding of its strengths and virtues, as they not only share goals for their play, but also share experiences that led them to their current goals. Take that same terminology, however, and try to apply it to somebody who skipped the whole '90s (playing older games all through it, say) or actually prospered as a hobbyist in that culture, then they'll have a quite different understanding of what "traditional" means. I meet people who think that White Wolf games are progressive and entirely different from bad old D&amp;D now and then, for instance, so for them "traditional" means rather different things...<br/><br/>Still, these are just communication difficulties, and surmountable on a case-by-case basis when we talk to each other. There might be political bias (cultural politics, I understand) in some choices of language, but that's again individual motivation - we are not responsible for how others speak, so we should just find words that help us understand each other. For instance, I don't really think that Chris has any particular political agenda in mind - he just wants to talk about importing techniques between what he perceives as different traditions of gaming. Most people will agree that there are lineages of experiences, goals and design solutions in roleplaying, so the question should be discernible even if you don't agree exactly on where those lines lie. To me GURPS and Vampire are very similar games that only differ in some superficial mechanical approaches, while another person, or myself in another context, might choose to classify them as representing discrete lineages. As far as I understand it, though, Chris isn't doing that here, he's just gesturing vaguely in the direction of the Forge and asking whether taking those ideas into trad games is something you do. I guess that "I don't see any new ideas there, so there's nothing to take" is a valid answer, there doesn't have to be any drama in that. I see many new ideas that have been brought to fore by Forgean deconstruction, but somebody who's played different games than me might have been using those same ideas all along, and thus won't recognize any break in tradition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265824/#Comment_265824" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T15:59:09+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  3:59PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2010 4:00PM by Daniel H..">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sanglorian</cite>So my question to you is, do you play like a story gamer in traditional games?

When I started describing my character's combat actions, rather than rolling the die and waiting for the DM's interpretation, I was told, explicitly, "We don't do that."  It was puzzling.<br/><br/>I embraced my inclinations, however, and continued to ham it up with the best of them.  I spoke in my dwarf voice, introduced \u201cfacts\u201d about the setting, and acted on perceived character motivations, while they read their power descriptions off their cards and tried to avoid getting surprised by the next combat encounter.  I don\u2019t know if I would recommend this approach, as I was being deliberately contrary, but also I took responsibility for my own enjoyment and therefore had a great time, whereas otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265833/#Comment_265833" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T16:47:02+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  4:47PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's really the nut of the difference.

It's used that way about other cultural history like music and cinema and such, isn't it? If the word is value-laden here (I wouldn't know, I do most of my cultural discourse in Finnish), perhaps "critical gaming" would be better? The idea to be transmitted by the phrase is that there is a background tradition that is perceived as insufficient and static, and therefore a clear readjustment of goals, tools and expectations is required. Would "alternative" imply the same thing? Perhaps. "Radical" is also an option, in the sense that the progression that the Forge culture has been seeking has come about by concerned effort at returning to the roots of the practice of roleplaying; as we all probably know, rpg theory centered on deconstructing and analyzing the media of roleplaying is behind much of the thinking in this culture. That's "radical" in the sense of abandoning existing structures in favour of going back to the basics and reapplying them rigorously. Looking at what I do nowadays myself in game design, I'd judge that we're still doing exactly that, and will probably continue for a while. This OSR stuff, for instance - its fruits will be in reconstructed game texts that transmit effective practices of play more clearly and attractively than old texts.<br/><br/>(I'm leery of using "indie" as a description of content, although in some discussions I've been known to use the short-hand just to get successful communication over. It's especially annoying when "indie" is not used just to mean "experimental" or "weird", which is wrong enough, but as a synonym for "Forge-influenced", like the Forge were the only place where creator-owned games are made. The latter is a bit difficult thing in that the Forge is not formally a school of design, so talking about "Forgista games" is not exactly exact, but there regardless exists a clear lineage of designers and games that share certain influences. I'd love to have a better term than "Forge-influenced game design", which is a bit clumsy and doesn't really tell you whether Forge influenced the design in terms of giving you a sweet dice mechanics or by brainwashing you to believe in GNS. I'm sure similar terminological problems are an everyday occurrence in any cultural field.)<br/><br/>But anyway, the point is that I don't mind Jason disagreeing about scene framing, conflict resolution and whatever that list was. My own experience is that the things I listed had not been powerfully phrased in game texts I'd encountered before - certainly not to any extent sufficient to make me actually understand and apply the methodology in my own gaming. But I haven't read and played all games, not nearly, so this isn't that surprising. I guess that nothing prevents Jason from engaging the topic of the thread by face value - if Chris thinks that something like scene framing is an "indie idea" and not "traditional", then what does it matter if you or I disagree? I for one would be interested in hearing about Jason's experiences in scene framing in traditional games - who does it, how extreme it is, what goals it has, does it work outside Primetime Adventures and so on. Whether scene framing is properly traditional or radical doesn't matter for this thread, it seems to me.<br/><br/>Actually, another interesting side topic, if you don't mind, Jason: if those things I listed aren't effective in describing general differences between Forge-style games and traditional games, then which ideas would be? You mentioned that there are some ideas in the Forge culture that are not part of the traditional scene, so I'd be interested in hearing what they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265857/#Comment_265857" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T18:36:01+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  6:36PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2010 6:40PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Jason: if those things I listed aren't effective in describing general differences between Forge-style games and traditional games, then which ideas would be?

Feng Shui had previously incorporated some minor narration passing before but Forge games are the first I know to really run with it as the central aspect of a game system.<br/><br/>* Game mechanical means of directly structuring the fiction to match expectations. With Great Power did this times one billion.  Primetime Adventures kinda sorta did this, but more squishily. Spycraft did it somewhat on the "traditional side" (the mind, she recoils) with the Mastermind budget system. I'm surprised more has not been done with this.<br/><br/>* The "everybody runs up and tells you everything" advice in Dogs in the Vineyard, in order to snap a game out of investigative mode and into judgment mode. That's great advice to achieve an effect I'd never seen explicitly laid out before.  (Remember, I count GMing advice as part of a game.)  A lot of times players even in regular old games get bogged down in digging and digging to find a "right" solution, not meaning solving a mystery, but finding a way that there can be a happy ending/great outcome for everyone decent. That is sometimes fun but it leaves out a whole bloc of stories. This is a great way to really shift gears.<br/><br/>* Joint, systematized setting/situation creation. Systematized situation creation of course dates back to the first wilderness encounter table. Forge games (Universalis, Fiasco, In A Wicked Age, Verge) are the first ones I've seen to make using that particular system a joint responsibility.<br/><br/>That's off the top of my head, I bet I can find many more.  Basically I think virtually all games have some new idea in them, whether they be "trad" (thpoo, I make the sign to ward off the evil eye) or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265858/#Comment_265858" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T18:43:23+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  6:43PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To return to Chris' original question (and I will document my assumptions about trad and story games as they come up so we can be clear.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sanglorian</cite>So my question to you is, do you play like a story gamer in traditional games? Do you have to consciously resist the urge to do so? Or do you embrace it?</blockquote>\nI DM a 4E game for a bunch of longtime gamers.  It is a traditional, strong-DM game in that I'm the guy directing the story, and I have the primary responsibility for antagonization and for introducing complications and bother.  And I get to draw all the encounter maps, and no one gets to say what's in them but me.<br/><br/>I call our style of play 'subway play'  (and it might be presumptuous to name it, this might be something everyone does, so I hope I don't sound too high-n-mighty with this.)  Our play alternates between encounters  ( the subway lines ) and decision points ( the stations ).  <br/><br/>The encounters are railroaded.  I'm driving the train at that point, and if the party veers too far away from the material I've prepared, then all bets are off -- we might even have to pause or abort the session to let me regroup.  Luckily, the  buy-in level at the table seems pretty high, so as far as I can remember this has never happened.  Railroading the encounters gives me the chance to really ruminate on them and try to make them as gnarly as I can, without the risk that my prep will be wasted.<br/><br/>However, when the party leaves the subway line and hits the station, they have decisions to make.  I openly announce and solicit the next story-direction from them.  At this stage I don't provide any of my own input aside from maybe a menu of choices--which the players are totally free to ignore.<br/><br/>Where I believe this may contradict the assumptions of 'trad' play: The players' decisions can be for in-character reasons ("my guy would really want to go to the City of Brass and look up his girlfriend there") or for player preference reasons ("Spelljammer killed my father.  Don't ever as me to play D&amp;D in space") or for authorial reasons ("It's time for us to finish that story thread and move on, it's getting a bit old, let's tie it up or abandon it.")  I don't believe that any one agenda is prioritized above any other agenda at our table.  I do believe that some groups would balk at using any but in-character reasons to guide play this way -- I definitely would if I were still a GURPS-playing teenager.<br/><br/>This mode of play has helped our table, whose members have several different play agendas, to have a successful campaign together.  Those who are into challenging encounters get them; those who want to author a shared story get that, those who want to live the dream can do that.<br/><br/>( and again, I hope I don't sound all hoity-toity when I talk about how the Enlightenment of progressive story-gaming has revitalized my play. It took me thirty-some years and exposure to many different kinds of game before I realized why some players just didn't seem to like my DMing style, but that could be me being slow on the uptake, rather than me discovering some essential truths of the RPG universe. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265860/#Comment_265860" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T18:50:46+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  6:50PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are also good examples of Forgey ideas Jason has there, I think. Even if there is just one continuum of design without meaningful breaks and reconsideration of things, one can still ask how far and wide these ideas can be applied outside the specific game they originate in. As I discussed early in the thread, I myself don't do a lot of blind transferral - if I'm going to rework a game's procedures, then I'll do it bottom-up, and if the outcome happens to resemble how some Forge game works, then that's just because it's a good idea, not because I'm loaning the idea directly from another game. And of course there are ideas that just are not very transferrable despite being discrete - I already complained about narration sharing in that blog post, but there are plenty of other things that simply aren't universally applicable to any old game.<br/><br/>I also agree that most games do have original ideas, originality is in no way a property that traditional games lack. I just find a difference in what these ideas are applied on; the prior art you use as a starting point that informs your design determines the tradition your new work belongs in. If there is no such prior art because you're doing radical deconstruction, then you might be starting a new tradition. Pretty straightforward, I think. I also like to think that Forge designers are usually more critical and analytic in what they do and why they do it, but that's just an observation with no particular justification.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265862/#Comment_265862" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T18:58:28+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  6:58PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just realized that when I answered the OP in terms of being a GM.  What I did with 7th Sea was cut and trim until the game was something I wanted to run and my players were willing to engage.<br/><br/>What I would NEVER do is show to a game and start trying to play it "my way" regardless of the game at hand or group expectation.  Like, if I show up to a Trail of Cthulhu game, I'm not going to start summoning up Nightgaunts and using them to avenge my sister's death.  Great attitude for Sorcerer, not so great for Trail of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>I saw a very recent example of this.  I don't have all the details but this my third party after the fact observation.  There's a group I play with on Wednesday evenings.  None of them are employed so they meet earlier in the afternoon for another game.  I show up the other night and they're in the middle of a rather heated conversation.  It seems that the game the GM was running earlier kind of failed.  In particular she seemed kind of mad at one particular player.<br/><br/>Now here's the thing.  That particular player is really into these "crazy Story Games."  He likes the PtA game I'm running for them and a few nights before I ran S/lay w/ Me for him which turned out to be a borderline spiritual experience for him.  Anyway, the impression I got was that the GM was trying to run a more group focused mission based game when this player's "story gamer" instincts kicked in and he started playing his character rather aggressively (which sometimes translates into playing parts of the world or NPCs aggressively as well).  The result: BOOM!<br/><br/>I honestly don't think he was in the right.  It was clear from my second hand info what kind of game the GM was running, so it should have been crystal clear to him who was actually involved.  I personally would have either played into that or simply not played.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265863/#Comment_265863" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T19:09:24+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  7:09PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2010 7:11PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>The idea to be transmitted by the phrase is that there is a background tradition that is perceived as insufficient and static, and therefore a clear readjustment of goals, tools and expectations is required.

The OP was saying how when he was 12, the players didn't share any info about their characters the other characters wouldn't know.<br/><br/>"Even as a twelve-year-old, I knew you didn't share mechanical details with other players. Your character wouldn't know, so why should you?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265878/#Comment_265878" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T21:21:51+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  9:21PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2010 9:23PM by Jesse.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a case of unintended consequences and a case of the writers not fully understanding the real-world social impact of that rule.  From that textual instruction there is a very natural social progression among the real people.  It looks something like this.<br/><br/>Player A and Player B do something that Player C wants in on or otherwise leverage.  However, Player C's character has no knowledge of what Player A and Player B are up to.  So Player C being creative and clever person has his character do something that he can provide ample in character justification for that will put him in the fictional position he wants relative to the actions of Player A and Player B.  However, the astute and socially observant GM knows full well that Player C is declaring that move specifically because of his knowledge of Player A and Player B's actions.<br/><br/>So who wins?  Player C's reasonable and creative in character justification for the action or the GM's social observation of the OOC reasons Player C has even jumped through those creative hoops in the first place.  An unresolvable argument ensues that is no fun and extremely exhausting for the GM especially if Player A and Player B are calling foul on Player C's move.<br/><br/>Being the social creative police of the group is NO FUN.  So the simple most obvious solution is to clamp down and really keep the information secret  Make sure that what the CHARACTER knows is EXACTLY the same as what the PLAYER knows such that it becomes IMPOSSIBLE for the player to announce actions for his character that does not stem from direct character knowledge because those things are literally identical.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265884/#Comment_265884" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T22:18:00+00:00" title="April  6, 2010 10:18PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2010 12:58AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Except that when I was fifteen years old, the very natural social progression went something more like Player C being called a dick by Players A and B, and Player C saying "Jeez, I should stop being a dick."  And so he stopped.<br/><br/>I don't think that anyone ever got to the point where they thought that being the social creative police was a full-time gig, it was more like...well, like how you dealt with people who did uncool things in real life.  Everyone in the room pointed and laughed and made fun of them for being so uncool, and they learned that they'd better be cool if they didn't want it to happen again.  In many ways, the relentless cruelty of peer-pressuring teenagers is a more effective deterrent than any force on this earth.<br/><br/>...which is just another way for me to say that man, sometimes I just don't get what the rest of you guys were doing when you were kids.  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/><br/>And more to the point, this still doesn't prohibit discussion of all mechanical details, and that's really the sticking point for me.  What kind of kids play AD&amp;D and don't brag about the cool stuff on their character sheet?  What iron-willed teen can possibly keep quiet when he's got a longsword +4 in his inventory, I ask you?
