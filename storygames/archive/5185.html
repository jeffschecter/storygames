I like her, and her boyfriend. I'm not sure about the other people who would be playing, but I assume they're good people. But.. Vampire: the Masquerade? Not exactly my cup of tea, system-wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm down with clan politics, internal struggle, shady denizens of the night and paranormal intrigue. It's just the Attributes/Skills and 1,000+ splatbooks that have me leering.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I proposed running something V:tM-esque, but in a system that would give me traction and allow for more indie goodness. I'm here now to ask for your help in determining that system. I talked to one of the possible players, who is the central figure in arranging the game, and he said that the following is what he likes in Vampire:<br/>\n<br/>\n*Character Motivations. He mentioned this one might be a leap for some of the D&amp;D-honed players, but what is really awesome about V:tM for him is the focus on personal drives.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Clan Histories. He used the phrase "rich cultural tapestry" at one point. I inquired more, and found out that the idea of a rich history was more important than a well-documented one. (ie, it's fine if we re-write the cultural tapestry around the table.)<br/>\n<br/>\n*Disciplines. He was big on this one. Now, I've never played V:tM, so correct me if I'm wrong... but Disciplines are powers that are derived from your lineage/bloodline. They're pre-dispositions towards certain types of badass mojo.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Clan Politics and Social Intrigue. Any game will work with this to a degree, because I like using R-maps... but the game should foster or at least not block big social interplay.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all said, here's what matters to me in a game: big player input potential, not clunky or unecessarily crunchy, story-focused, low prep, ability to create and introduce new setting stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here are my current thoughts on systems to run a V:tM story with:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.) The Shadow of Yesterday. Secrets could parallel Disciplines maybe. It's still got ranked skills, so it's a good mid-point between indie funk and trad tangibility. Keys help make that personal motivation stuff really concrete and immediate for players more used to "get the shiny" gameplay. It's simple, and I've never had a bad session of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.) Covenant. Drift it a little bit, by changing "cell" to "clan", and having every clan create a different clan sheet (different purpose, different conventions, different motifs). Maybe have all Vampires share the first Convention/Motif, and then the last two be Clan-specific.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.) Some hybrid of tSoY and Covenant, which tacks Conventions/Motifs (clan-specific) onto the shadow of yesterday's system.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.) Conspiracy of Shadows? I've never played it, nor do I own it. Can someone sell/unsell me on this one?<br/>\n<br/>\n5.) Something else? Pitch me something!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117070/#Comment_117070" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-30T03:39:27+00:00" title="December 30, 2007  3:39AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IMO tSoY would make for a great Vampire game, but then I haven't played or read any of the others.<br/><br/>I've always thought that a Vampire-themed Don't Rest Your Head Mod, like the one Bailywolf hacked together somewhere on RPGnet, would be really funky too.

It says "Just like other games, this one has simple one-roll conflicts and large, extended conflicts. The difference is that instead of making X the extended conflict, TSOY makes what you care about the extended conflict." It takes something familiar and redefines it in a really interesting and empowering way. Rock.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Secrets/Keys are easily customized/adapted/created. Keys are formulaic, and many Secrets are too. This means that it's possible to customize all these cogs to match a Vampire: the Masquerade setting and tone easily and have it all flow smoothly. There's no "hacking" needed, just "customizing". That's enticing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Advancement + a focus on relationships means that the game can smoothly and easily flow for multiple sessions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking that Covenant has the following strengths:<br/>\n<br/>\n*That relationship map that's built right into the middle of the character sheet. 'Nuff said. Like Polaris', it makes understanding relationships and NPCs simple and engaging and somewhat tactile.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Conventions/Motifs allows for a simple way of describing Clans and possibly Disciplines.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Freeform Edges means that I don't have to gut and replace lengthy skill lists, etc, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Covenant is already based in modern secret societies, so it's just an easier mental jump in ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Order/Faction/Personal is an easy divide which makes for immediate and emotional conflicts, which map out across a bigger political picture. Important for Vampire. Also, having Conventions/Motifs for each clan would mean that there was potential for lots of clan focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThings I'd do if I used TSOY: Replace many Secrets/Keys. Possibly remove Gift Dice, or modify them to be like Clan Dice or something. Figure out a way to inject more clan politics into the game (Is Keys enough?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThings I'd do if I used Covenant: Remove Truisms, possibly replacing them with some form of advancement thing (Goals?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117073/#Comment_117073" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-30T04:31:05+00:00" title="December 30, 2007  4:31AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keep gift dice. Gift dice aren't pulpy, random or superheroic! Gift dice are how the people round the table encourage each other. They can be used as highly personalised motifs (like Covenant), for attention to genre or theme, for reincorporation of setting, or for humor. And usually, when players offer gift dice, they tell you what it's for ('this is for the angst') - could there be a clearer flag?<br/><br/>The wiki has examples of Clan Secrets, and they'd work a treat. Again, if a player really <i>really</i> wants to emphasise a certain bit of the Nosferatu, they can focus on that with a secret. If a player wants to pull away from the stereotypes, they can do that too.<br/><br/>Why would you remove truisms from a Covenant variant, though?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117075/#Comment_117075" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-30T05:02:31+00:00" title="December 30, 2007  5:02AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe</cite>Things I'd do if I used Covenant: Remove Truisms, possibly replacing them with some form of advancement thing (Goals?).</blockquote>\nThe simplest thing is to replace the truisms with humanity traits. Things that your character clung to as a human. Then the accept/reject choice becomes whether to accept or reject parts of your humanity since your transition to vampire, which gets to the core of what the game is supposed to be about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117077/#Comment_117077" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-30T05:48:55+00:00" title="December 30, 2007  5:48AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 30, 2007 5:49AM by Johnstone.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Joe<br/><br/>Its not that hard to get rid of the "bad stuff" from Vampire, actually. A few of the tweaks they made for Vampire: The Requiem and new WoD help in this regard.<br/><br/>You don't need fiddly combat, for one thing. It's just contested dice pools, pick a stat, pick a skill, roll versus. Same as any other conflict - don't use the Dificulty Rating so much, actually roll dice for whatever opposition there is.<br/><br/>*Disciplines: give em more than the 3 dots to start. Starting Vampire characters are really fucking boring to play unless you've never played before. Disciplines are fuckng cool! Give them lots!<br/><br/>*Clans and vampire histories: Don't use the metaplot - it marginalizes the PCs and kills fun. Use only the clans the players find interesting. If somebody wants to make one up, use that. Any bits of history floating around in the books you like, take it and use it in your game, with whatever clan or NPC vampire you want. Focus on the "rich tapestry of history" and not on WW canon.<br/><br/>*Social stuff: Remove things that make it easier to kill vampires, like aggravated damage. Make it much easier to kill humans - like give them half as many health boxes. So if the players want to blow shit up and go crazy, they can easily kill a bunch of mooks, but if they can get at least part of what they want by talking to vampires instead of killing (although a little punching/wrestling match can work good, too), they will be more inclined towards social maneuvering. Also if NPCs are interesting (thats universal advice tho).<br/><br/>*Humanity - This is the big problem with Vampire, I have found. Humanity and the Paths are a punishment system. You do something "bad" and the GM punishes you. They don't actually encourage a player to DO anything - can't do this, can't do that, can't do the other thing. If you could instead get the players to define their character's motivation behind being a vampire, or their justification or purpose or what they do, then you could instead punish them for straying from a player-defined path, instead of a list you find in a book.<br/><br/><br/>Man, I played the shit out of Vampire back in the day. I can give you better advice in person.<br/><br/><br/>[Matt's suggestion for Covenant is pretty cool, though. Disciplines and powers might not be quite as cool, though - you'd have to watch out for that.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117078/#Comment_117078" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-30T06:11:43+00:00" title="December 30, 2007  6:11AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, like Johnstone said.

Break free of your comfortable indie games and find how to make this work. Treat it as a challenge.<br/><br/>So use gift dice, use relationship maps, use character motivations.

It's got lots of good stuff: it supports the atmospheric Sim stuff really well. And the clan politics and so on. It's all there.<br/><br/>By the way, Disciplines are powers.

Vampire has some cool system elements laid over a core system that I'm not interested in. I also think that the system fails to put focus on narrative, instead putting it on world simulation. To me, not interesting.<br>\n<br>\nBasically, there are these games I love. And I want to run them a fun game that feels rewarding for me as well as feeling new and fresh for them. Only one of the guys in the entire group has ever played Vampire before, and I've talked with him about the possibility of running something else. Something with stakes and newfangled ideas. Mostly it's stakes I'm looking for.<br>\n<br/>\nI think that I'd be compromising my fun if I used the Vampire system. That or I'd have to spend a good deal of time tweaking/hybridizing/indiefying the system so that it would be fun for me.

As long as you are willing to accept the conceit of: "Your peon 13th gen vampire does, in fact, have a chance to kill/entice/subvert/manipulate the Vampire Prince of Europe right in the eye!" If you accept that, it works. If you don't, then yeah move on. I dunno many good vampire games that contain "monsters" (objects that only react with an "It kills you or you kill it" behavior set). But you will have to concede that you can fall in love with - be friends with, or do other stuff other than kill - those evil vampire clans (antitribu?).<br/><br/>BUT, if I may also kick in advice, I was thinking along the same lines as Graham's crack-addled post.  You can still use Vampire the rules, with the tricks you've picked up from other games: Not rolling constantly, using stake setting, using the Mountain Witch trick, playing off the cuff. Kirt Dankmeyer made a Spiritual Attributes (squint, it's Keys) mod for World of Darkness as well, it's out there somewhere if you really want to slap it in there.<br/><br/>And yeah, you don't need tons of - or any - sourcebooks to play "Vampire". I played quite a bit of it when it first came out, and while it was basically The Adventures of Action Vampire Cops, the core book had enough stuff to inspire games of social influence, games of personal horror and redemption, etc.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R. Nixon</cite><br/>The dude obviously loves Disciplines. Run Vampire and hippy it up.</blockquote>\nMy thoughts, too. Trying to shoehorn disciplines into another system will probably be a lot of work. Hippifying it ("just, I dunno, throw 10 points into three disciplines") might work better: Less rolls, more meaningful roles, no micromanagement of starting character gen if you don't want it, and then just make stuff up in play.<br/><br/>Just some thoughts.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117161/#Comment_117161" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-31T06:51:25+00:00" title="December 31, 2007  6:51AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite><br/>Basically, there are these games I love.

That means feedback after each session, discussions on where to take it and appropriate modifiers for the next time.<br/><br/>The good thing about this approach is that it's not only responsive to the players' needs, but ends up with a finely honed result -- a game that is the best at providing exactly what the group wants, instead of a game you must talk the group into.<br/><br/>It's dumb to increase the Discipline spread simply by virtue of teh Aw3s0me!!111!! for several reasons. First of all, fewer dots tends to supercharge creativity, because the tools are not perfectly suited for the job. Getting your money's worth out of Command is pretty damn nifty. A second reason is that clan ties are what get people into learning out of clan Disciplines, so if people have extra dots to pick those up it weakens motivations to get involved with the city network. A third reason is pacing, as disciplines allow many aspects if the plot to get resolved fairly rapidly by cutting through the need to deal with networks of people and vampires that are the default environment for play.<br/><br/>If you want meaningful changes in power, it's smarter is to hand out Experience in big chunks. Advancement as a game of inches works well in some long-term games, but to get the feel of a character who's transformed by experiences, big leaps are better. I've used this method for 8+ years now in WoD games, where XP comes in big chunks occasionally (though in short games, make that every session) and it's excellent.<br/><br/>Make use of Conscience, Self-Control and Courage for more than their typical functions. I find they work well as add ons to Attributes when no other skill applies. You might also use them to provide situational advantages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Haakon" title="Haakon"><img alt="Haakon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Haakon">Haakon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117171/#Comment_117171" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-31T07:25:31+00:00" title="December 31, 2007  7:25AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe it's because I spent Christmas reading the pdf, but maybe Spirit of the Century is what you're looking for?

Aligning the vision of Vampire: The Masquerade that's in your head with the one that's in their head is, from experience, a tricky and oftentimes painful process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117183/#Comment_117183" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-31T08:52:59+00:00" title="December 31, 2007  8:52AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite><br/><br/>Bringing Down the Pain is a perfect alternative way to portray the Beast, right down to turning conflict from a general, chaotic, human affair to the kind of cold-blooded detail that only a psychopath could really walk through step by step, especially since BdtP is the only way to murder someone.<br/></blockquote>\nDamn it, Malcolm - you are so entirely right.

Nothing speaks of politics and inter-party strife better than the trust mechnic there.  It's easy and people can select a few disciplines as abilities.<br/><br/>Otherwise I'd use FATE (Spirit of the Century).  Let's face it, Vampire is a superhero game where the justification for powers is vampirism.  Go with the action packed pulpy feel, throw in some cool social drama and you have an easy setup and delivery.<br/><br/>My last suggesttion comes off the last one - With Great Power...  Very little has to be done.  Your making a vampire comic with lots of melodrama.  Tone down the four color elements and you've got yourself one rockin' vamp game.<br/><br/>Just what I would do.<br/><br/>What I wouldn't do... run Vampire.  I'm saying this to spur conversation to some degree but I think that is the primrose path.  There is too much crap there to deal with heading in - splatbooks, pages and pages of disciplines.  If you say "we're using these books" then they will expect that your USING them.  Coming to the table with a different game but say "we're playing the the World of Darkness setting" sets the stage for some fresh thinking and a clear perception of the expectations.<br/><br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117207/#Comment_117207" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-31T11:19:48+00:00" title="December 31, 2007 11:19AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I talked with AJ over the phone more yesterday, and we've come to a conclusion.<br/>\nThat conclusion is "Your hippy stuff is cool, but I don't think it will work with this group."<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to all the playas that suggested running the Vampire: the Masquerade system, you totally just won. I'm going to be running Vampire: the Masquerade.<br/>\n<br/>\nI"m going to utilize the following suggestions:<br/>\n-Hippifying it ("just, I dunno, throw 10 points into three disciplines") might work better: Less rolls, more meaningful roles, no micromanagement of starting character gen if you don't want it, and then just make stuff up in play.<br/>\n-Don't use the metaplot - it marginalizes the PCs and kills fun. Use only the clans the players find interesting. If somebody wants to make one up, use that. Any bits of history floating around in the books you like, take it and use it in your game, with whatever clan or NPC vampire you want. Focus on the "rich tapestry of history" and not on WW canon.<br/>\n-So use gift dice, use relationship maps, use character motivations. But use Vampire.<br/>\n-My second thought is that, since you have many systems to choose from, you should be able to introduce elements from them organically. That means feedback after each session, discussions on where to take it and appropriate modifiers for the next time.<br/>\n-Make use of Conscience, Self-Control and Courage for more than their typical functions. I find they work well as add ons to Attributes when no other skill applies. You might also use them to provide situational advantages.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I like Malcolm's suggestion a lot. I'm going to run Vampire, and if someone is unsatisfying for me after a session or two, I'll suggest a drift.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117208/#Comment_117208" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-31T11:40:26+00:00" title="December 31, 2007 11:40AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, have fun, Joe!

Focus on the "rich tapestry of history" and not on WW canon.</blockquote>\nis what everyone has always done with WW canon whether they thought they were doing it or not.<br/><br/>GM-as-stake-setter works pretty well in most traditionally GM-ed games, if you remind yourself to do it alot, so you can potentially still get what you want in that respect. Remember that many players in those games get through them without ever thinking of what they-the-player want to have happen next, which is a burden some don't want, so if you get a lot of blank looks that should tell you something about what they're having fun thinking about.<br/><br/>Vampire is a phenomenally good and resilient game, you really have to work hard to fuck it up.<br/><br/>Oh, and let me suggest that you don't do this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>-Hippifying it ("just, I dunno, throw 10 points into three disciplines") might work better: Less rolls, more meaningful roles, no micromanagement of starting character gen if you don't want it, and then just make stuff up in play.</blockquote>\nThe reason that structured character generation is so popular is because it works so well for new players. There's never ever a time in D&amp;D or Vampire chargen where someone says "you can do anything you want, maaaan", there's always a specific list of options and specific set of instructions. That fuels creativity.  If you don't want to follow the rules in the book for character creation, okay, but then make your own rules up and make sure everyone sticks to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/warren" title="warren"><img alt="warren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wmerrifield.googlepages.com/GoPlayMario.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/warren">warren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117213/#Comment_117213" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-31T12:00:26+00:00" title="December 31, 2007 12:00PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 31, 2007 12:00PM by warren.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh!

I don't know what your group's magic words are but here are some I've used:<br/>"The danger is that..."<br/>"What's at stake is..."<br/>"What you're risking is..."<br/>"So what you hope to accomplish is..."<br/><br/>Say the magic words every single time, when the dice are in their hands but before they roll 'em.<br/><br/>At first, you'll need to finish the sentence every time yourself, with a period, like:<br/>"The danger is that you'll set off the trap instead of disarming it."<br/>"What's at stake is, do you make it to the ferry in time or do you have to go the long way around?"<br/>"What you're risking is being overheard by the goblins on the rooftop."<br/>"So what you hope to accomplish is to get through the doorway, whether this ogre lives or dies."<br/><br/>But after you've said it three or four or ten times, you'll be able to trail off with a question mark when you want their input:<br/>"What you're risking is...?"<br/><br/>And then, once the dice are on the table, always always always make it like this:<br/>- If they succeed, they win what's at stake. They accomplish their accomplishment or they avoid the danger.<br/>- If they fail, they lose what's at stake - and you IMMEDIATELY introduce something new at stake. It might be another chance, it might be a consequence, but what matters is that it's more serious that the former.<br/><br/>"The danger is that you'll set off the trap ... and you do! A dart thocks into your shoulder. The danger now is that you'll succumb to its poison!"<br/>"You reach the dock as the ferry's pulling away. Do you want to jump for it?"<br/>"The goblins overhear you and start dropping in through the skylight. They scramble all over you, biting and screeching. The danger is that they'll get you off your feet!"<br/>"Not only does the ogre keep you away from the doorway, it's pushing you back toward the chasm..."<br/><br/>In combat, you'll probably want to have an overall what's at stake for the fight, and little tactical what's at stakes for each exchange. When you describe the setup, mention two or three features of the environment, like hanging tapestries or a swaying bridge or broken cobblestones, plus an apparent weakness of the foe, like worn armor straps or a pus-filled left eye, and then when you say what's at stake for an exchange, incorporate one of those: "the danger is that he'll push you back onto the broken cobblestones" or "so what you're hoping to do is to further strain his armor straps." This is on top of hitting and damage and whatever, just add it straight in.<br/><br/>It's especially effective if you always give a small bonus or penalty for the exchange before. What's it in D&amp;D now, +2/-2? Give it every single exchange, linked to whether they won or lost the what's at stake of the previous exchange. "The broken cobblestones mess up your footing, so take a -2." "He has to shrug and shift to adjust his sagging armor, so take a +2."</blockquote>\n<a href="http://lumpley.com/hardcore.html" rel="nofollow">http://lumpley.com/hardcore.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117235/#Comment_117235" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-31T13:31:09+00:00" title="December 31, 2007  1:31PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aw, crap.

I made up a few factions, made up more on the fly, and if the players came up with anything, I incorporated that into the setting.<br/><br/>* Kept the basic dice pools, but used them for basic conflict resolution, rather than task resolution (based on Christopher Kubasik's "Interactive Toolkit" essays, but not Vincent's hardcore stuff, since Vincent hadn't written it yet).<br/><br/>* Had every player come up with a Sorcerer-esque Kicker for their PC. There was no mechanical benefit (like there is in Sorcerer), it was more of a "I'm not running a game with your character unless you provide a Kicker" thing. I explained that I was mostly doing this so that they had a real say in how the story started and what direction it took.<br/><br/>* Had a bunch of passionate and driven NPCs with agendas and relationships, and then let the PCs bounce around in the sandbox, throwing Bangs at them when I felt they were needed. Based on the NPCs and their relationships to each other and the PCs and a list of cool stuff I wanted to throw in, I pretty much winged it, doing my best to only use stuff that engaged the players. It seemed to work, and everybody had a really good time. One PC started as something of a comic relief character (a sleazy, two-bit gambler and conman with a penchant for barely legal females) and ended up as one of the most dramatically-engaging and moral characters in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117354/#Comment_117354" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-01T17:16:12+00:00" title="January  1, 2008  5:16PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might add that I've tinkered with the die mechanic as well, substituting Sorcerer's method of Victories rather than WW's target number success counting.

If you're going with Revised, I think the system is actually quite strong; you may just want to use some hacks to speed up combat a little bit.  <br/><br/>The nice thing about the metaplot and the detailed setting, for me, was that there was so much stuff written that there was almost always something inspiring that I could run with.  Even the really stupid stuff can work great for this, as it forces one's mind to come up with something clever to rationalize the otherwise inexplicable.  <br/><br/>The one suggestion I'd make regarding the setting to choose which faction you're going to play and sticking with that faction pretty strictly.  If you're running a Camarilla game, the Sabbat is either the weird barbarians down the road or not an issue, for example.  That really plays up the manifold dangers and challenges of vampiric existence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
