In a spark of spitefulness, I thought... What if you just outright <i>asked</i> the players if they think the thing happening now is cool? If so, to continue. If not, to cease it. And that decision actually affected the course of the game in an immediate way? It'd be a funky, dice-free way of resolving a scene. Kind of a jury-based resolution system:\n<blockquote>The group faces a challenge. Each turn, group members submit a vote to either:<br/>* <b>resolve</b> the challenge<br/>* or <b>extend</b> the challenge.</blockquote>\nIt's just a simple seed, but from it emerged a few fiddly bits:\n<ul><li>There could be a cost for extending a challenge, acting as a limit to the length of the scene. The most obvious cost is hit points, but could just as easily be another resource like Courage, Stress, Fan Mail, etc. In extending the challenge, players might even choose which resource is taking the hit.\n<blockquote>For example: You're fighting a bully in the playground to defend a little kid he's picking on. You want to continue the scene so you have the option of choosing to take a hit in one of three pools of tokens: Dignity, Body or Faith. If you spend a Dignity token, you narrate how you sacrifice a bit of your pride in order to keep on fighting. If you spend a Body token, you narrate how you're taking the punches and wedgies. If you spend a Faith token, you narrate how you find strength in religion to persevere despite the persecution.</blockquote>\nIn other words, pulling a token from one of those pools doubles as 1) your choice to continue the challenge and 2) flavoring the sacrifice that continues the challenge.</li>\n<li>Cost might also be reflected in an escalation ladder. Using combat as a model, each extension ups the ante for the challenge, escalating from words, to hand-to-hand, to melee, to guns.\n<blockquote>For example, if you continue the fight with the bully, he might get frustrated with your persistence and call in his buddies to bring the big baseball bats and tire irons.</blockquote></li>\n<li>As a counterpoint to the cost, the size of the reward could follow a bell curve, using the number of "Extend" votes as increments. At 5 extensions, the reward rises, at 8, it rises again, at 10 it reaches a peak reward, the gradually falls at 18, and so on. If voting is anonymous, you never quite know if the challenge will cease at the optimal moment.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the cost you choose to pay might have a thematic relationship with the reward you get at the conflict's resolution. You could sacrifice Hit Points to gain Constitution or pay Cowardice to gain Courage.\n<blockquote>For example, you're trying to continue the fight against the bully so that you win Respect from the rest of the student body, or maybe even from the Bully himself. You'll get the most Respect if you last a two or three turns and then tap out before you're pummeled into ground hamburger. Even if the other players' characters aren't involved with the scene, they can still vote and help (or hinder) your ability to last until just the right time.</blockquote></li>\n<li>Beyond rewards and costs, you could also fiddle with the conditions for resolution.<br/><br/><i>Unanimous "Resolve" Vote Resolves the Scene</i> - Makes sure a scene ends when everyone wants it to end, but might cause scenes to continue even when only one player found it interesting.<br/><br/><i><b>Any</b> Unanimous Vote Resolves the Scene</i> - This probably works best in an anonymous voting scenario. The scene ends when everyone chooses to resolve it OR extend it. This would encourage "the one hold-out" scenario seen in 12 Angry Men.<br/><br/><i>Multiple Votes</i> - For small groups, you could give each player the option of casting multiple votes (of either type) so you get a bit more of a gradient in the resolution.</li></ul>\nI'm not planning on using this idea for anything soon. (Knowing my track record, this whole idea is <i>probably</i> broken.) But some over on my LJ have said it's a bit like Shadows over Camelot and Munchkin in terms of forming voting blocs, alliances and all that. Thought maybe you'd find it chewable.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79017/#Comment_79017" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-01T16:21:33+00:00" title="July  1, 2007  4:21PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2007 4:21PM by misuba.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it's arguably the foundation of the game I'm working on designing now, so I hope it's not <i>completely</i> broken.<br/><br/>IMO this gets even more interesting when you leave aside the whole notion of breaking play up into "scenes." Or, put another way, going to the mechanics to end a scene could be read as a kind of constitutional convention - an opportunity to break the situation down and build a new one, or to continue the existing situation and drive it towards a new conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79029/#Comment_79029" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-01T20:00:21+00:00" title="July  1, 2007  8:00PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, can you elaborate on how your game is implementing this concept?
