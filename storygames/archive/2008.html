                    I was going to post this in Merwin's "What Price, Novelty" post, but he doesn't need me stinking up his thread. <br/><br/>So, here's a separate thread.<br/><br/>FIrst off, let's knock of the "nice" jokes, ok? That's fucking stupid, and really annoying to me particularly. Andy asked me if he could use my comments about nice-ness to start a new thread. That thread became a loaded gun, one that fortunately didn't go off. This is my urging to you to knock off those flippant "nice" snarks. I'm already tired of that shit. It's been, what, four days?<br/><br/>Now, on to my next grumpy old man post: <br/><br/>The idea that we would want games BECAUSE THEY ARE COOL is profoundly disturbing. I am not interested in a hobby where owning a particular game, or a particular edition, or a particular rarity, equates in some kind of thrill in and of itself, or -- much, much worse -- a badge of cool among a subculture. <br/><br/>The idea that role-playing is <i>who someone is</i> rather than <i>what someone does</i> is really backwards. I keep seeing unconscious references of this kind. <br/><br/>(I'm waiting for replies to call me out. I have identified a post or two at least, but I'd just as soon not insult individuals, which me pointing out would effectively accomplish. Can we be honest about this and agree that this happens to some extent? Here's to hoping.)<br/><br/>I think it drives people from our hobby who don't want anything to do with that lifestyle. I think it's hurting us more than helping us.<br/><br/>It's a fine line, isn't it? Remember when Nathan said he was tired of Awesome? Well, how much of Awesome was raw thrill of seeing something new and getting excited about it because it was <i>something new you could do this weekend</i>? And, how much of Awesome is the bizarre thrill of knowing that <i>just having it in your hands makes you better somehow</i>? I don't think it's honest to say that NONE of the enthusiasm is this second thrill. <br/><br/>I mean, Jungle Speed? I can take it or leave it. I played it once. It's fun to play. I'm pretty bad at it. But, seriously, am I a less cool person for suggesting it's not worth all the damn noise? I mean, I get it. It's funny. I watched Keith and Mayuran wrestle like tomcats. Funny. But, really, who cares?<br/><br/>Here's what I am saying: If you support story games as a concept (and if you don't, this sure is a poorly named site!), then can you agree that story games as a concept are quite poorly reprsented in the traditaional publishing industry? In other words, the games aren't many and reasonably hard to find. And, if that's true, then it makes a whole bunch of sense to say that this is at least a small activity, if not a niche. <br/><br/>Why, then, behave in such a way that newcomers won't comprehend the hidden language of cool, not understand the subculture, and run screaming for the hills when they don't get all this. <br/><br/>I think this is nuts. <br/><br/>I'd much rather see us talking like regular joes about an activity we do. Sort of like my wife who talks like a regular person about scrapbooking, or my brother about golf, and so on. They are passionate and excited about their hobby, of course.

                            Malcolm Sheppard is the man who assigned the phrase "geek omerta" to the silence that many gamers have about their hobby and that phrase is hilarious and spot on, and essentially the converse of what you are suggesting here, which is also spot on. Talk about it like a normal person to others? Oh noooo, no, no no, never. But go all bugnuts with each other? You bet!                        </div>

                            Matt,<br/><br/>I'm less convinced that this is a problem that relates to a hobby as a whole than it is a problem that relates to a specific type of person.  Some people are just going to participate in this sort of behavior.  But I am with you in that I hope that this doesn't become the defacto behavior of our particular group/sub-group of people.  I only make this observation because I do know people with other hobbies (like golf) who do this same thing and given how large the scrapbooking hobby is I would be surprised if there weren't people involved in it who are the same way.<br/><br/>What I'm not getting is what you are calling "the hidden language of cool".  What exactly do you mean here since this seems to be another issue altogether to me.                        </div>

                            I agree with your comments Matt.  I think more regular joe talk, less jargon, and less artificial boundaries between what is, or isn't part of "the hobby", cool, etc. is probably a very good thing.  Even though this is "Story Games" it's good to see threads about all sorts of games -- D&amp;D, Battlelore, etc -- and not just of the "New Coolness / Old Lameness" variety.<br/>

                            I have a bookcase full of games (mostly White Wolf) that I collected for "completeness" and/or coolness back in the 1990s. I will get around to getting rid of them someday (at the moment I just give them away to anyone I know locally that wants them, I should probably e-bay them or otherwise sell them). Anyway, point is: What a wast of time and money.<br/>
<br/>
I'd much rather be gaming or straight-up talking about gaming these days than cultivating collectibility and gimmickry.<br/>
<br/>
Talk about false idols?! It's absolutely akin to Dodo collecting.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm with you on this one Matt.                        </div>

                            Matt, I generally agree with you. <br><br>It's important to note that you're conflating a few different ideas: that you don't like the idea of getting pleasure from owning the game itself; that you don't like people defining themselves by roleplaying; and that you think this behaviour alienates newcomers.<br><br>But can you see a positive side to some of this? Isn't it good that, after waiting months for a game, I can buy it and get pleasure <i>just from reading through the game</i>? I remember how I felt when I picked up Paranoia XP, from that store in San Francisco, or my copy of Dogs In The Vineyard. Sure, the main pleasure comes from playing, but isn't there some pleasure in just enjoying having the game? You must have experienced that, surely?<br><br>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Your hobbies are your own. <br>You don't get to choose for anyone else. <br><br/>And as evidenced by Pagan Publishing's works, you don't even get to set the eventual market price for your games. <br/><br/>For a bunch of guys who spend (IMO) forever splitting hairs on topics I can't even remotely grasp, the idea of abhorring badges of XYZ in a subculture is amusing. <br/><br/>I didn't buy the Nine Worlds upgrade because I played the original and liked it. I bought it because I thought the original book was cool, and I wanted a more competently produced version. Nuts to you. I've never read either book all the way through. I've never played the game. I thought the podcast was dull and switched it off after 10 minutes. <br/><br/>I'm content with my purchase. Are you going to stop publishing because I don't play your game? I should hope not. <br/><br/>And here's another thought: if I show a really unique publication, wouldn't the content ignorant still acknowledge that it was well produced? I show someone a 200-year old book, they're going to ooh and aah even if they don't know anything about home decorating in the 1800s. Cool cuts across knowledge boundaries. It breaks niches! <br/><br/>I don't geek out and start talking about my greatest character ever or my most coolest items unless it's relevant to a conversation. By the same token, I'm reasonably secure in my hobbies, and I don't care who knows I roleplay -- I know some people who won't even let slip that they roleplay to their coworkers. I can't imagine hiding such a large part of my life from people I see every day. <br/><br/>At this point, I don't even know if I'm on topic. Sorry about that. <br/><br/>==============================<br/>A minor illuminating distraction: <br/><br/>I just discovered something SO COOL. <br/><br/>I highlighted the above quoted text with my mouse (click-drag) in Matt's original post before clicking on the quote button. It just pulled the excerpt. I'm sure everyone knew this before I did, but still.... <br/><br/>Whee! That's NEAT. And I can keep doing it and adding quotes to my post (but I didn't need to).                        </br></br></div>

"I do not think that word means what you think it means..."   The first time I read it, I wasn't sure what you meant; the person, or the game...Now, I am pretty sure you mean that they think owning a game makes them cool..and in this case, I'll agree...that's just silly...as silly as someone wearing GAP jeans because it somehow wearing that brand name makes them better than everyone.<br/><br/> However, if you really did mean that they want to own games because the game is cool, or they find it thrilling to have a special of copy of something; then I'm going to have to flat out say that's absurd to call it disturbing.   If I want to be proud to have an entire collection of Vampire Hunter -D action figures, or every issue of Changeling ever made because I think it's the greatest thing in the world...what do I care what anyone thinks; I'm going to do it anyways...because I want to.   (And if you've never bought something just because it looked nice, different or 'cool', you're either blind or lying...people do it with cars, clothing and games are no different)
<blockquote>The idea that role-playing is<i>who someone is</i>rather than<i>what someone does</i>is really backwards. I keep seeing unconscious references of this kind. </blockquote>
Unconconciously?   That's a nice way to put it.
<blockquote>I'm waiting for replies to call me out. I have identified a post or two at least, but I'd just as soon not insult individuals, which me pointing out would effectively accomplish. Can we be honest about this and agree that this happens to some extent? Here's to hoping.)</blockquote>
I had to read this a few times before I realized you were talking about how people think THEY are cool and should be hailed as gods because they think they know than others....I almost mistook it as people who think roleplaying the character is more fun than roleplaying the plot and was quite prepared to really start arguing otherwise.  (good thing I don't just skim through and jump to conclusions, right?)
<blockquote>I think it drives people from our hobby who don't want anything to do with that lifestyle. I think it's hurting us more than helping us.</blockquote>
You know what else hurts us?  People running around and being snobby over styles.   Just because one person doesn't like roleplaying that way doesn't make it a lesser form of roleplay.   People who play that form get ragged on as being 'inferior' somehow, and that's just hoggish!<br/><br/>One style of roleplay is NOT better than another, and there's no need to try and pass judgement on how embarrassed you happen to be over the four geeks in the corner getting excited over a d20 critical hit compared to the four larpers in the other corner, argueing about why you can't trust a pooka...<br/><br/>So try that rant on for size!
<blockquote>It's a fine line, isn't it? Remember when Nathan said he was tired of Awesome?

It took you how long to realize that?   I'm glad I'm not the only one!

Hey, why limit types?   People post where they feel they have something to contribute, and ignore the ones they dont' have an interest in...<br/><br/>Lets not knock anything.<br/><br/>...Including collectables...I may not be 'Cool' because of it, but I sure as hell might think it IS cool...and that's my choice to have!  <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>

                            Matt, the roleplaying publishing industry seems, to me, to be a pair of conjoined twins:<br/><br/>1) Selling books that are pretty, fun to read, and neat artifacts to own.<br/>2) Disseminating games that are fun to play.<br/><br/>If someone was only interested in doing the latter, they could release their games as free text files.  But hardly anyone does this, because a lot of people seem to believe that things that you pay money for, or things that are printed, or things that are really pretty are more valuable and probably more fun to own and play.  That's marketing for you.  Sometimes you try to get people to buy your game on sight alone, when they know nothing at all about the content or how much fun it is to play, based solely on its qualities as an artifact.  But people will certainly feel cheated if the game is prettier than it is good.  It'll just sit on their shelf for a while and then get sold on eBay.<br/><br/>I'm all for turning roleplaying into "just another thing that we do" like the way I play the banjo and do graphic design and enjoy reading comics.  But those things aren't free of these tensions either, right?  I feel the commercial desire to buy a tricked-out banjo, get the newest version of InDesign, and, sometimes, pick up nice hardcover editions of comics I've already read, just so I have them around "in case I want to read them again."  So, yeah, I do feel like the commodification of game products has gone overboard, but it's probably impossible for us to escape that entirely.<br/><br/>Still, more efforts to "normalize" the hobby would be very welcome.  I'm all for that.  Rah-rah etc.                        </div>

                            Uh....y'all recognize that this is the important bit of Matt's post, right?
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>Here's what I am saying: If you support story games as a concept (and if you don't, this sure is a poorly named site!), then can you agree that story games as a concept are quite poorly reprsented in the traditaional publishing industry? In other words, the games aren't many and reasonably hard to find. And, if that's true, then it makes a whole bunch of sense to say that this is at least a small activity, if not a niche.<br/><br/>Why, then, behave in such a way that newcomers won't comprehend the hidden language of cool, not understand the subculture, and run screaming for the hills when they don't get all this.<br/></blockquote>
Nobody's passing judgement on play preferences.<br/><br/>Here's a lens to look at this through: the idea of measuring the worth of a game by how many people <i>buy</i> it, rather than how many people <i>play</i> it, is directely opposed to the ethos that infused the generation of many independently published games, and is actively destructive to the publishing and marketing strategy that many of them continue to follow.                        </div>

                            Matt, <br/><br/>well, I think you're partially right but for the sake of discussion, I'll focus on where I think you're wrong.<br/><br/><b>Collecting</b> has a lot of fascinatingly disfunctional elements but it's a universal human obsession, not a sin. (Scrapbookers collect memories and materials, golfers collect courses and status). Besides, the plus side of collecting is that it frees things from the 'drudgery of being useful.' This past year I have gamed more frequently than any time since the mid 1980s, and I still, due to play-testing, only got to play a handful of published games. If the only value of story games is in actual play, then maybe I shouldn't have bought a bunch of new games that I might never get a chance to try out. There is this subtext in our slice of the gaming hobby (probably a tenet of the cult of actual play) that buying to read or because the game has an interesting concept or to support someone's creative work is degenerate and actually harmful because it props up a false bubble in the micro-economy of indie games.<br/><br/><b>Coolness</b> can be a form of fashion and snobbery but it can also be a measure of interest, with the line between too fine for me to distinguish sometimes. So I think it's great if someone acquires and supports and writes enthousiastically about games that they think are cool. If groupthink develops around the latest coolest product then its up to folks with different tastes to spin attention in different directions. <br/><br/>Gaming is probably an <b>insular subculture</b> but as others have said, so is any hobby if you look closely enough. Elitism in the sense of shared cool and coded language is one of the payoffs that develops in almost any subset of human behavior. When I start learning about some new interest, I assume that I'm going to have to unravel a few knots of technical jargon and cliquishness and as long as there are friendly people and ways through the maze, people will find their way in. My own personal gripe about rpgs and the like is that points of connections are assumed to other geeky hobbies like sci-fi media and fantasy art etc etc and all other possible linkages are harder to make- this is one area where story games have been very helpful in diversifying the subject matter of games.<br/><br/>The overall message I got from your post is to curb your enthusiasm, which I would not want people to do. The enthusiasm of others is what keeps me coming back here.                        </div>

                            Word to what Nathan said.  Sales != success.  Sales == sales.<br/><br/>However, I would also say that the amount of play doesn't necessarily indicate anything about the quality play.  And the quality of play is something impossible to measure, except by word of mouth and the like.  So maybe we need to start another tread about How To Measure Success.<br/><br/>(As a side comment, <i>Nobilis</i> was recently ranked the top game on RPGnet.  And that's not about sales or amount of play.  And I really doubt it's about the pleasure of owning that giant white tome.  Is it about feeling like a member of the in crowd if you "get" the game?  I hope not.)                        </div>

                            Hey, Matt! I will be reading this thread with great interest when I can find the time. Thanks for starting this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with many of your points. I find many of these attitudes about gaming disturbing myself, though I can't seem to express it properly at the moment. It's especially disturbing since we're discussing games. Fun. Diversions.<br/>
<br/>
For good or ill, I will always judge a published game by its presentation though. (which is only part of the issue that spawned this thread, I understand.)  Considering my role in this industry, that shouldn't surprise anyone.<br/>

                            Thanks, Jennifer. For the record, I am not dismissing presentation of publications. I am not saying this lightly. I have done the book design for over a dozen role-playing games. I demand that my books look exceptional, and I like to think I get that accomplished from time to time. This has nothing to do with books looking or not looking good. I am not dismissing ANY publication technique (hardbacks, foils, artwork whatever). I am criticizing their <i>purpose</i> and their <i>reception</i>. Take Jonathan's potentially disturbing issue: How many people own Nobilis because it's an astounding physical object? Now, how many of those people never got beyond that? It troubles me to believe, as I do, that this number is not zero.                        </div>

                            I feel like marketing and design are being smooshed together into som sort of play-dough monstrosity here.  <br/><br/>Man, people buy shit because it's cool all the time, and I am uncertain why we would expect RPGs to be any different.  And I'm uncertain why we would want them to be, unless we feel that "games are designed to be played" is in contradiction to  making sales.  I mean, Obviously, _I_ think that contradictionis crap, since hell, I feel games are also designed to be read, passed around and sold, all of which have different priorities.  But I also do not think that this opinion is universal - I know some people feel sales are something that happens or doesn't happen, you just make the game you want to make and let it roll.<br/><br/>And I'm totally cool with people doing that, but man, my obligation to do so is pretty much nonexistant.<br/><br/>So, by extension, let's say Story games (whatever the hell they may be) _are_ under-represented in the mainstream.

To the extent that it makes it more difficult to find people to share one's beloved hobby with, yes. I could stand up right now and ask my co-workers if they want to go bowling, and that I will buy them beer. I WILL get takers. If I stand up and ask them to join me this weekend for some story-gaming, and I'll provide beer they will do one of three things: look at me funny and decline, ask what the hell that is and decline, or accept (and still wonder what the hell that is).

On the other hand, how many people bought Nobilis because it's an astounding physical object and thus got lured into the world of gaming when they might have not otherwise?    I don't think you can say that answer is zero either.<br/><br/>Saying that to buy a game because it looks cool but without the appreciation of the object is akin to suggesting that beer drinkers shouldn't drink wine.                        </div>

It has absurdly negative social baggage. I think we'd be foolish to deny this. I've seen it happen probably hundreds of times. I consider this a waste and a trajedy, and I think dismissing the "mainstream" because we're all fine here, thanks, is ignoring a lot of reality AND mainly acting as a social defense mechanism for ourselves. I think that's bad. <br/><br/>I also have conversed with you enough to suspect strongly that you do not share my opinion. C'est la guerre!                        </div>

                            There's a couple issues, and I'm not really sure which one is more the focus of this discussion so far.<br><br>Issue 1: Someone might buy Nobilis because they want to be one of those people that has Nobilis, so they can participate in "Nobilis is the most beatiful book" threads or whatever - basically, so they can be part of that sub-sub-sub-community. Designers see this effect, and go "hey, I should design a really beautiful book so that it will be a fetish object so the people will get it just for that." This ethos is a very difficult one to reconcile with the ethos of actual play being the most important thing about our hobby.<br><br>Issue 2: Some non-gamer sees Nobilis in the store and buys it because it's pretty. They go online to get more info about it, and about this whole "RPG" thing, but all they can see is people talking about how awesome the book is, without ever giving advice or encouragement for actual play. Non-gamer never gets into the hobby because they don't see that the hobby is about play.<br/><br/>Matt, how do those strike you? Am I close to what you're aiming at here?<br/><br/>(x-posted with Matt, Judd, and like a bunch of other ppl. We should all slow this down.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Heh.  Apologies if I seem to be dwelling on the specifics, it's a bit of a habit, but the irony of this is that I think we are in agreement as to the issue, and probably even on the fact that it's quite important, but the difference in conclusion merit some discussion.   <br/><br/>Specifically, if the concern is the social status of games, are we suggesting that story games are some sort of escape pod from that? Something we can spin off  and build up as a separate and perhaps someday socially acceptable thing?  Or are story games the solution? The path by which the core of gaming will become more appealling to the mainstream?  Is there some other solution?<br/><br/>See, I don't think there's any real danger of anyone ignoring the world outside gaming - it's pretty big, and that's where most of the food is.  And if we're engaging that issue, then awesome.  But if we're not, and we're not going to address non-story gaming, then what are we doing except dwelling on our own l33tness?<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Matt, <br/><br/>I think I understand you, and I have some thoughts, but first I'm going to restate what I'm getting from you, and you can correct as necessary. <br/><br/>It looks like you have observed a troubling trend in our (specific niche of a larger) hobby, one that makes it less accessible to a general audience. The 'troubling trend' can be roughly equated with similar trends in other 'geeky' hobbies - it is, for lack of a better term, fetishism of hobby-associated objects (mostly books, in our case, but also specialty dice, figurines, etc). This trend is also present in other socially 'geeky' pastimes, and manifests in some of those as:<br/>-figure collecting (rather than figure-play)<br/>-comic collecting (rather than comic-reading)<br/>-rare book collecting (rather than reading good books)<br/>-etc.<br/><br/>You seem to observe (and I would agree) that the barrier of entry or interest is raised if that fetishism is percieved by an outsider to be an inherent or pre-requisite part of the hobby. You would prefer that games be bought in order to be played, and that if they were more commonly perceived as activities rather than geek-idols, people you would like to share the hobby with would be more likely to try them.<br/><br/>Am I off-base?                        </div>

<p>I fail to see how people buying stuff exclusively for the cool-factor is harmful to the hobby.   This really just seems to me like yet another thread about trying to get all those cool mainstream folks to like the same things we like.  Which I think is some seriouly silly ass shit.</p>
<p>If I act crazy and dorky about gaming, and I happen to do it in front of someone who comes away from the experience with a bad attitude about gaming, well tough.  If that means it's tougher for you to introduce that person, or someone they talk to, into playing with you, then I'm sorry.  But I'm not clamping down on my dorky, geeky, fetishizing of pretty things in some misguided effort to protect the hobby.  Or your pool of potential gamers.</p>

                            So...<br/><br/>Does anyone on this thread own a game or game book that they have had for more than say... a month, that they haven't even read yet? <br/><br/>What about the stash of loot you got at GenCon, any of those you haven't read yet? <br/><br/>Not even, "not played" but "not done more than sat on your shelf." <br/><br/>I know I recently slowed down my purchasing rate because I realized this was starting to happen to me. I had picked up Pendragon 5th edition last Christmas, and didn't even read it until my birthday (July). I had a friend get Mountain Witch at GenCon 2005 because I wanted it so bad, and didn't read it for like 9 months. So I slowed down on the buying. I take in books at more or less the rate I can read them now. <br/><br/>Thing is, I have friends who haven't done that, and have gotten to the point where they have told me they are probably not going to get around to even so much as reading all the RPG books they've bought. They buy to collect. It happens. If it makes them happy, I don't have a problem with it. <br/><br/>But what Matt's talking about goes a step further than that, because it adds in the social acceptance factor. If you aren't buying to collect for yourself, but to collect so that you can feel part of the crowd that owns the book, not because the book is cool, but because it makes you cool by having it... that.. well.. I won't say it's terrible, but it doesn't make me happy. (And the exact same thing happening in comic books in the 90s screwed them hard, so I don't know if its healthy from a market perspective either.) <br/><br/>I see signs that this happens here and there, but I'm honestly not sure how much of a problem it actually is. It's hard to say because it can be hard to figure how much people are actually playing, much less actually reading, and human motivations are such a mess that figuring out why you do something yourself is hard enough -- figuring out why someone you only know as text is doing something is a nightmare. <br/><br/>I do, however, think it behooves a lot of us to stop once in a while when we're getting jazzed about a new game we're about to buy and say "Why am I buying this, honestly and exactly?" <br/><br/>And if the answer is one you're happy with, then go. Sometimes, however, I wonder how much the Indie market has started to fall into some of the prestige/collect/cool traps that we used to rag on companies like White Wolf and their running-dog-retard freelancers for doing.                        </div>

What's considered "cool" or not depends on the group in question, and the value you place on that "coolness" depends on how much you want to impress or fit in with that group.  It depends on whether you are trying to be cool within a niche, cool within pop-culture, or not really trying to be cool at all. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>My point is that cardgames and boardgames enjoy much wider appeal amongst the general population.  That means more people buying those games, and more people <i>playing</i> those games.  I think that's worth thinking about for both those reasons.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>I am not speaking hypothetically. These exact co-workers recently had a bitch-session about how much of a loser one must be to play video games. Much "Have you ever even kissed a girl" nonsense and so on.</blockquote>
You must live in Iowa. I know exactly how you feel, because if I was out kayaking with the guys I work with and I said, "Hey, you want to come over and play a rpg later, I'll buy." They would probably flip my kayak over, give me a good dunk in the 40 F water, and when I rolled up, they probably say, "Did that cure you?"<br/><br/>You make good points that I agree with. Does the question then become what is to be done to make gaming more acceptable in the mainstream? Is talking in another language enough?                        </div>

They also tend to lack two things; sparking the participant's creativity outside the very narrow context (often) and the Geek Themes (not as often, but quite). They are easier to approach, even if they share some of the negative social baggage roleplaying games fall under. Those bowling co-workers Matt mentioned might or might not be intrested in boardgames or card games other than poker.<br/><br/>Perhaps - and perhaps in other thread - we could speculate what dropping some of these things would do to roleplaying:<br/><br/>- Game.<br/>- Creativity.<br/>- Geek Themes.<br/><br/>I see something like Breaking the Ice having dropped the third one, but that's a pretty lonely spot to sit on, still.                        </div>

                            Rob, <br/><br/>And like I said, I'm cool with that. (One of the reasons I buy in bulk in Gen Con is that its cheaper than paying for shipping to the frozen north, so, there are also economic reasons for things....) <br/><br/>OTOH, have you ever bought one of those games you've not read, or won't finish, because buying it and saying you owned it would give you cred in the community?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>OTOH, have you ever bought one of those games you've not read, or won't finish, because buying it and saying you owned it would give you cred in the community?</blockquote>
Y'know, not precisely, but I have occasionally bought them just to _own_, like Gygax's guides to Roleplaying.  They fill me with terror, and I can't imagine  any genuine use in them, but they're like a car crash.  I cannot look away.  I picked up Nexus: The Infinite City because I'd heard it gave the rules you needed to deconstruct Feng Shui templates, but do I take some pride in ownership of it by virtue of it being rare and dead, but cool?  Yeah, I do.  Not the most adult of responses, I suppose, but there is a pleasure to having secret treasures.<br/><br/>Now, do I think this makes me more alpha in some way, or that it's going to impress the women?  God no.  But I like games, the artifacts themselves, as something separate from the pleasure I get out of play, and I consider this an extension of that. <br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Hey Jonathan,<br/><br/><span style="color: #993300;">...the roleplaying publishing industry seems, to me, to be a pair of conjoined twins:<br/><br/>1) Selling books that are pretty, fun to read, and neat artifacts to own.<br/>2) Disseminating games that are fun to play.<br/><br/>If someone was only interested in doing the latter, they could release their games as free text files.</span><br/><br/>I think the selling=commerce=industry meme warrants some examination, in that it's a particularly stingy meme that doesn't like sharing "dollars change hands" with the hobby meme. The actual difference between industry and hobby isn't the selling activity. A hobby is a community of appreciation for an activity. And in a pure hobby, there is no stratification of the participants. There are no lessers (people or entities) who've ceded power to other people (or entities). All participants are equal within the context of the hobby. Industry, on the other hand, is about stratification. Industry is about consumers and producers, and about extracting profit from the exchanges across the strata. But just because industry is about commerce doesn't mean a hobby can't have buying and selling of goods or services. Let's say you and I are into remote controlled cars. And you're an awesome pinstriper. In no way are we on some slippery slope to industry if I kick you a few Hamiltons to pimp my car with your awesome pinstriping skillz. Not if we aren't stratifying into consumers and producers.<br/><br/>And that's my problem with premium editions of games (and comics). The indie design community is an assertion that we are all equals (and that this is a hobby). We come into conflict with the counter assertion by traditional publishers that this is an industry, and premium editions of games and comics are part of this assertion. Personally, I'd love to own the hardcover premium edition of The Watchmen. It has a section in the back of the book with character concept sketches and a chronicle of the development. I'm not immune to having my wants tweaked by products with premium features. But within a hobby premium features and manufactured collectibility have to be regarded as an irritating status game. Why wouldn't you just publish the game true to your vision, exactly as you'd want to buy it? To reserve important content for a premium edition is artistic dishonesty. To add production features for a limited premium edition is a maximizing revenue technique that works by tweaking the fetish instincts of others. It treats others like programmable objects. It's something you do in an industry. It tells me the publisher thinks this is an industry and not a hobby.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

                            Rob, <br/><br/>Right, which means your "cool" is possibly related to, but still separate from the one Matt is talking about. It's basically the difference between "its cool that I own this" and "I am cool for owning this."<br/><br/>In his version of it there comes a point at which you are buying books so that you can get to be more alpha, or more in the group, or more awesome just by the books you own. You see this with comic collectors sometimes, where the dude with money has props even though he hasn't read (or loved) half the comics he owns -- but he still owns more than anyone else. You see it other places too, even in the mainstream (golf club competition anyone?). <br/><br/>The thing about it is that it usually does build up a level of resistance around those who want to get into the activity and get buffeted back by the kind of inbreeding factor that such a type of cool breeds. So even if it isn't damaging to the community (even though it annoys me in gold and comics even more than in RPGs) on the inside, it certainly doesn't help get new folks into it.                        </div>

                            I'll add in a point of interest. I have bought games I don't foresee playing. Not "that I would not be interested in playing", but that I don't foresee a good opportunity to play. In most cases, this is motivated by a desire to mine them for technique/color I can use in a game I do have a good shot at getting some actual play of, but sometimes it's motivated by other concerns:<br/><br/>1. To support a game's launch. I've bought a couple of small-press games as pre-orders or similar in order to help finance the initial print run. I consider this a way to contribute to the design community that also has the nice effect of me having a cool game. Often, that game is one that I won't get to play, because it's too "out there" for my available pool of players.<br/><br/>2. Because the game is a unique and interesting artifact. I like art. I like innovation. I want to reward designers who push the boundaries of the form. This is a "vote with my dollar" kind of motivation - "not what I like, but awesome", but in a concrete form. Often these games are eventually given away to someone who will use them. This is likely to be the eventual fate of my <i>Nobilis</i> book. (Although I did actually play that one).<br/><br/>3. Nostalgia. I own a bunch of games that I have fond memories of. I will never play them again, for the most part. Others, I entertain crazed notions of playing. (Large box containing an E-bay lot of nearly everything ever published for <i>Torg</i>, I'm looking at you. You're broken, but you were <i>so close</i> to being cool.)<br/><br/>4. Impulse. I have bought a few games just to see what all the fuss is about, or because they were sitting forlorn on the shelf of a thrift shop. These will eventually go off to Half Price Books or E-bay. But inertia is powerful.<br/><br/>Finally... in a big sense, I am my games. My decisions about which games I will play can be driven by what my peers think is cool, or by what I think is cool. The downside to letting them be driven by what I think is cool is that often, I have long stretches of minimal play. I'd rather, though, that I continue to buy the games that I want to play, and try to convince others to try them, than that I have lots and lots of Actual Play, but the games I really want to be playing languish in some "indie ghetto" because only people who already have a network of peers who like that sort of thing buy them.                        </div>

                            This thread is about a lot of different things that seem to merge and split depending on who is making what point. Which is cool and all but maybe some threads should be split off?<br/><br/>For example, I am absolutely with the people who talk about buying games in order to support the designer financially -- but it seems to have been grouped with buying a book for the cool factor, buying it for production values, and the like. If the only concern is whether a designer has an accurate idea of how many people are buying his or her game for what reasons, then I guess I can see that, but as far as mentality goes the motivations behind these types of purchases seem quite different to me.<br/><br/>I've spent quite a bit of time in and out of the spoken word/slam poetry community, where a similar do-it-yourself publishing aesthetic is in full force. Artists who have their shit together and/or have some money put together CDs to sell on tour, but chapbooks are also very common. Now, this is a performance medium, and what works on stage doesn't always work on the page -- so sometimes these chapbooks are, bluntly, crap. And yet, I still buy them, all the time. I buy crappily-produced CDs, books with smudged ink where the ends of lines disappear into the fold, whatever. Because a lot of what these products are is an excuse for me to support the artist's real craft, which is performance.<br/><br/>Does this analogy transfer entirely to RPG publishing? Of course not -- the whole performance/paper split is non-existent, for example. But the motivation for those types of purchases remain -- wanting to support the individual artist, wanting to support whatever idiosyncratic notions inform their work, and wanting to see more of the same. I don't see how any small community where people know each other and where personal expression is involved can pretend that this is somehow unhealthy. And yet I often see people wondering about just how many of X game's sales at GenCon were to other designers in the community, as though there were some subtext that made these sort of transactions non-sales. I guess that's important from certain very specific angles, but come on -- the whole idea of RPGs is that the audience and the artist are identical during play. Why is it a problem that the producer and consumer roles should be similarly dissolved?                        </div>

                            In fairness, I don't think there's any real desire to paint collectors and, for lack of a better word, snobs with the same brush, though I'm pleased it got kicked around a little.  I am pretty sure the sole (and possibly universal) objection is to dysfunctional purchases, which is to say, purchasing things to give you a reason to lord it over/be cooler than other peopl, which is to say, I don't think anyone objects to collecting, we just object to being a dick.<br/><br/>And that's cool.  A lot of the original energy seems to be directed at the fact that gaming is considered a home to a variety of social dysfunctions, rightly or wrongly, and the snob collector is definately one of the ugly examples of it (as are most other species of snob).  I doubt there's much disagreement there either.<br/><br/>What to do about it if anything?  Well, _there's_ the minefield.  It's a little scary that "Talk like normal human beings" is as radical-seeming as it is, but it's probably not a bad start.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

Once you start charging -- ANY amount of money -- for something you create, you stop being a hobbyist. <br/>Charging costs without labor is a business decision, not a hobbyist's decision. <br/><br/>And here's the really, really important part: <br/>When I publish something true to my vision (and I may have different levels of vision), and charge appropriately, the rest is all in the perception of the customer and the market. <br/><br/>Unlike most books, which depreciate as soon as they're released, Ligotti books climb in price. He publishes what he wants, drops it, and moves on. Customers unwilling to pay market prices do without. Is he a hobbyist or a businessman? His writing sells, he makes marketing decisions. I'd call him a professional writer and not a hobbyist writer. <br/><br/>Hobbyist writers are the ones who write borderline or outright copyright-violating fanfic and post it on newsgroups for free. I'm not one of them. <br/><br/>Hobbyist writers write ad-free blogs and personal diaries. I'm not them either, though I make weak attempts from time to time. <br/><br/>There's probably other kinds of hobbyist writers. I don't think I'm one of them.                        </div>

My thoughts on this are pretty basic.  (and I'm speaking for myself, of course...because it's my view!)<br/><br/>Perhaps my vision isn't limited to a single thing?<br/><br/>I will have a PDF, a book, and possibly a boxed set.     All of these fit a different vision.<br/><br/>The PDF will be downloadable, and affordable so that it is not limited to play by a price bracket.<br/>The Book will be affordable and basic, so that those who don't want or need anything but the basics can get just that...the basics.<br/>And if I do the boxed set?   It will be a book that just goes one step further and includes the things that are nice to have but not absolutely nessisary.<br/><br/>So, while a newer gamer might not have the right dice or cards or character sheets, I provide those with the book in the box set...and now they don't have to run around and buy more things just to play something new.    For people who like Sanctum alot, it's just a perk that it happens to be pretty cards and dice that reflect Sanctum.  (The cards and dice and sheets don't -have- to be my own design, they could be generic, but if I'm going to offer something like that, might as well go the extra mile, shouldn't I?)<br/><br/>So, I'd say that it's a nice way of saying some people want the perks, and some people just don't.<br/><br/><br/>And I don't think I agree with the selling statement.<br/>I consider myself a hobbyist...Game development is a hobby for me, it just so happens that I sometimes take my hobbies seriously, and as such, they are expensive to do right.   If I'm making something because people want to play it, It doesn't make me less of a hobbyist to charge for the cost of my supplies and perhaps some of my labor.  You stop being a hobbyist when you're trying to make money more than you are trying to make games.                        </div>

I call BS on this one. But that's just my opinion.<br/><br/>I have always had a VERY strong break between work and fun. <br/>Any effort expended towards fun is not considered work. <br/>Working is necessarily not-fun for me. <br/><br/>You can't ask for a better professional life than to have fun earning your income. Thankfully, I'm in that position now. <br/><br/>In my past experience, every time I've tried to force something, to really work at something, I've stopped enjoying myself to get that goal accomplished. Not voluntarily, you understand, but the level of effort it takes for me to produce something I'm happy with -- that's a LOT of work, and doesn't come naturally. I personally don't find struggling that way to be fun. <br/><br/>Although it is a relief to finally be finished at the end of it. <br/><br/>Everyone will have an opinion here, and I suspect it'll be based on temperament and experience, much like mine.                        </div>

                            Deluxeness is an odd bird.  Theoretically we have "deluxe" edition of SOTC, in that there is a hardcover version and it costs $20 more than the paperback.  I haven't really considered it a deluxe edition, but I can see that by some definitions it would be.<br/><br/>There really seem to be two issues that I see to it.  The first is that, if I were to guess, I would say that there is a _perception_ that deluxe editions are more likely to correlate with "Bad collecting".  The deluxe edition bought for no reason other than to show off is kind of dorky any annoying, but the deluxe edition bought because it includes some functionality you desire, or to express your passion for the game line or the like does not seem problematic in and of itself.  Like most correlation issues, there's no good concrete answer here, but I feel ok asserting that once again the problem is in the behaviors, not the editions themselves.<br/><br/>Paul's issue of stratification is more interesting and more complex.  Right up front, I'm uncertain that I share his view, which I'm going to characterize (hopefully fairly) as rather egalitarian.  I can think of numerous examples of other forms of stratification within hobbies that are non-industrial, so I don't see the two things as being strongly related.   Still, the question of whether deluxe or special editions create barriers is a legitimate one, whether or not I agree with the reasons that led up to it.<br/><br/>As with many such problems, the fact that what we produce (games) and what people acquire (books) aren't quite the same really seems to be what gives this some legs.  If we were handcrafting these books, variation in them would be considered a hallmark of the art-form (as it is with many crafts) and no real problem at all.  Are deluxe editions any different?<br/><br/>I don't see any great difference.  However, when I envision a deluxe edition, I am envisioning something that has the same content (game) but a different packaging (book), and within that vision, I see no real problem.  If a deluxe edition existed which served as an "advanced" version, would that be a problem?  It certainly creates a barrier, but if it is so bad, is that an indictment of the old red and blue box for D&amp;D?<br/><br/>I honestly don't know.  I don't consider the moral obligations of the game designer to be well enough established to be able to tell when someone has fallen short of them. <br/><br/>Fun to think about, though.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

And here is the problem that I see...<br/><br/>-Why- is money the important part?  Is there a status quo or some 'better than you' club?    This sort of thing seems the very thing that most people hate in the first place...the whole 'better than you' suggestion as if it's a competition.                        </div>

If the criteria was that you can't call it a hobby when you earn your livelihood from it, I doubt you'd have encountered such a strong level of disagreement. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Me, I see no contradiction between a hobby and at-cost sales, or even supplemental income.

If the criteria was that you can't call it a hobby when you earn your livelihood from it, I doubt you'd have encountered such a strong level of disagreement. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Me, I see no contradiction between a hobby and at-cost sales, or even supplemental income. The fact that my mom sells knitted scarves at garage sales makes her no less a hobbyist in my mind.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>Exactly.                        </div>

I see at least:<br/>
<br/>
Fetishizing RPG purchases (Matt)<br/>
A culture of thinking you are what you own (Matt)<br/>
Afraid/not afraid to tell Normalz about our L33t Hobby (Matt)<br/>
Is it a Hobby or Not (later)<br/>
<br/>
These are all stuck into this big, messy ball. <br/>
<br/>
And I totally don't see instances of people thinking they are cool for what they own.  Fetishism for Great Objects of Our Hobby is one thing, but I think that's a genuine fetishism, and not about social issues ('wanting to be cool'). It seems Matt is mixing the two together.                        </div>

<p>(The italics return)</p>
<p>"Fun" and "Money" only have to be separate when you're operating from the bourgeois assumption that you have time off from your crappy job to have hobbies. I don't have any hobbies nor do I have a job. I have things that are worth doing and things that aren't. Those that aren't, I don't do (and frankly, a lot of the ones that are worth doing, I fall down on). Some of those things that are worth doing make me money, but some don't.</p>
<p>Paul, I applaud your will to stay true to your intentions with indie publishing, but they're not mine and I don't think they have to be. To me, independent media means being able to compete with much larger entities by banding together with other, parallel producers. It means being able to make something that fills a niche too small for a larger publisher to bother with, but large enough that I probably won't ever satisfy the demand.</p>
<p>That means that, if people want to buy my books and put them on a shelf â€” well, that's kind of weird to me, but it's fine. I can print more. Some people just really like orange. But those people aren't the core of my market and I think it's a waste to try to appeal to them. It's a market I don't know and one that I probably can't satisfy.</p>

Cost + hope. Seems simple to me. First make back what you're spending, then pick a number at random that you hope people will pay. <br/><br/>I'm not saying that most people do this, but a lot do.                        </div>

Well, I'm glad you clarified the fact that you are speaking purely for yourself now.  I know plenty of people who would not see making money in any amount, regardless of how small or limited it may be, as suddenly switching from being a hobbyist to being in the "industry."  I won't deny that there is a point where a person could switch from pure hobbyist to pure businessman, but for the most part people fall somewhere in between.  They may do some business, but also participate in the hobby just as they always have.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            Andy, you're probably not the only one seeing four (or more) issues in this thread. But, I hope I'm not the only one who doesn't see those three you attributed to me as entirely separate issues.<br/><br/>And, incidentally, this thread is great. But, I wish it was much less about the physical objects and consumerism and collection and all that stuff-stuff. And, I wish it was much more a discussion about behaviors that either help or hinder the activity and hobby.                        </div>

                            Matt, I think we have similar concerns about the hobby but different ideas about where the root of the problem is.  Which is cool, but I'm not sure how best to participate in this discussion then.                        </div>

                            Ditto what Jonathan said.<br/><br/>It seems that to participate in your discussion, we have to accept your assumptions (about the root causes of dysfunctionality).<br/><br/>This is difficult for me. I think you are lumping certain issues together, blaming symptoms on issues, and approaching this in a way that doesn't feel true to me. As a result, I can't really participate.                        </div>

                            Observation: That people seek to <b>be</b> cool by owning games is completely unsurprising (note: I'm not making a statement on if it's disturbing or not). Game communities, especially those online, and especially on the indie scene assign or deny credibility to people based on the games they own, the games they have read, the games they can converse about and the games they have experience playing. In many forums, you can not even join the conversation until you have played (never mind just own, or have read, or can converse about) a game that the other people in the forum, or thread have experience in. It is common in forums for people to be discredited because one poster has made in depth mention of a game that the poster (the one who will be discredited) does not own or has not read or played (note that these all often co-relate).<br/><br/>Owning a game does not, quintessentially make you cool in our communities, however NOT owning games can ensure that you stay (or become) uncool. Is there a functional difference between these two things?                        </div>

                            Note: the following post takes on only a portion of your claims. Maybe they were unintentionally-made points, or mis-interpretted points. If this doesn't apply to what you are saying, clarify that.<br/><br/>So, I buy artwork for the sole purpose of displaying it.<br/><br/>I bought this hardcover version of Divine Comedy because the layout and cover were gorgeous, and I like flipping through it and reading the occassional chunk.<br/><br/>I bought this really cool coffee mug even though it is a less practical mug and holds less coffee, because its print matched my desk.<br/><br/>I bought Cold City because of the illustrations of monsters in it.<br/><br/>...First of all, are the first 3 bought out of dysfunctional buying habits?<br/><br/>Divine Comedy was not intended as an art piece, but a work of great importance. I bought it because of its bells and whistles, and because I find it curious/interesting. I'm not religious, nor studying religion seriously. I put Divine Comedy on my coffee table, next to a coffeetable book about punk rock, a box of mandarin oranges, and some empty Coca-Cola cans. These things all reflect my interests and my identity. I am constructing my identity, in part, through the kind of consumer that I am. Sometimes I'm buying things SOLELY to construct my identity and the physical reflection of that identity.<br/><br/>Is that a bad thing? Is that not part of how all identities are constructed?<br/><br/>I buy Cold City partially because of the pretty factor. I don't actually intend to run it in the near future, because running something historical-sort-of scares me. I buy it to enjoy the mechanics, enjoy the writing, enjoy the art. I buy it, because it will inform how I play games and design games. In that way, I construct my "gaming identity", in part, through what I buy and read.<br/><br/>Buying Cold City, it reflects my gaming interests at the same time that it constructs them.<br/><br/>Now... I just want to ask a few questions here:<br/>Are you saying that this buying habit is an inherently unhealthy and dysfunctional one?<br/>Are you suggesting that I shouldn't buy Cold City just to "have it", and have it inform who I am?<br/>Are you suggesting that this isn't part of what identity means? The things we own should be seperate from the person we are?*<br/>Are premium products bad, inherently, because they are playing to our senses as opposed to our practicalities? If I like the pretty book Cold City, is that a bad reason to buy it?<br/><br/><br/>*because I don't believe that is true in the least.                        </div>

If you buy Dictionary of Mu because it makes you pant, your twenty dollar check will cash the same as anyone's.<br/><br/>However, as game designers, designing a game just to be bought, designing a game to be only ooh-ed and ah-ed over and not played is pretty lame.<br/><br/>That said, I want the play and the ooh and the ah.  <br/><br/>Hope that makes sense.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, why do you think I have the only say on "what goes" in this thread. It sure as hell never stopped people on SG before! This ain't the Forge. Discuss away.<br/><br/>Joe, you're covering some ground we covered already. <br/><br/>I never suggested anything about buying stuff being inherently bad and awful.<br/><br/>I never suggested you can't buy Cold City (orr whatever) for your own reasons. Who the heck could stop you even if I did say something like that? No one, that's who. See also what Judd has said a couple times in this thread. You likey pretty. Great. Knock yourself out!<br/><br/>Similary, yes, of course it's part of "who you are" in the same sense of what kind of jeans you where or where you buy your coffee or what art you hang on your wall or whatever.<br/><br/>Finally, yes I have the opinion that premium products stem from poor goals -- for indie publishers, particularly. It has little to do with senses vs. practicalities, because that's a very personal, individual thing. And, again, I can't stop any individual from thinking about their sesnes or their practicalities. However, I do think it's a kind of revenue-boosting tactic that results in long term loss for your "brand" as a game. That is, people are buying your brand because it's collectible  rather than playable (yes, of course there's cross over). <br/><br/>Should big publishers create these games? I don't know. They have a really different approach to publishing than many indie publishers I know. We're just so damn small, as is our revenue base, I just can't fathom why we'd bother proppoing up our self worth with "premium" editions. Instead, I'd much rather see publishers earnestly growing the cottage industry with no-bullshit great product that builds a reputation as stuff you play rather than stuff you collect. My concerns are as a publisher in a cottage industry.<br/><br/>Now, all that said -- again -- I'm much more interested now in addressing behaviors that this subculture performs that either helps or hinders access from other people. Here's one thing I keep seeing in this thread and the other recent thread: <br/><br/>"OH! I totally felt like a jackass telling people I work with I'm a gamer. Oh, did I mention they're geeks, too, who play Warcraft?" <br/><br/>Well, FUCK! What the heck is that? Real scary, huh? I mean isn't getting other geeks to act like geeks in a new way sort of like swimming in the shallow end? <br/><br/>I'm not talking about getting GEEKS (or, for that matter ANYONE) in the subculture. I'm talking about getting people to perform an activity -- and have nothing to do with the subculture whatsoever. <br/><br/>This is my point: The assumption that to game, one must come into the fold of gamerdom is exactly the kind of thing I'm advocating <i>against</i>.                        </div>

                            Matt,<br/><br/>Why? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult" rel="nofollow">Cargo cults</a>, man. If we own all the geeky accoutrements, embrace the <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/comics/dorktower/" rel="nofollow">geeky social oddities</a>, and follow the mechanical "rules" procedures described in the books — oblivious to obvious social contract realities — then hopefully the ancestors will bring us the true gamer fun that other people seem to be enjoying.<br/><br/>Also, I think it's part of the greater problem of materialistic self-identity in decadent consumer societies. "I'm going to the mall to buy myself a life," that sort of thing. Why would you really expect this hobby to be an exception, other than that it's <i>your</i> hobby and you expect better from your own?                        </div>

                            I think comics were in a similar situation that gaming is in now. It used to be that if you were an adult that admitted to reading comics, you'd be thought to be an imbecile. Gradually comics have gotten more acceptance from the media so that now big and small newspapers and magazines have begun to review comics and graphic novels like they'd review a book or a movie, taking them seriously. The more people see this, the more they're going to accept that, yes, comics are a valid medium for expression (maybe I'm not some prevert if I read this graphic novel!). The same thing is beginning to happen with video games.<br/><br/>So I think this is what gaming should strive for: being taken seriously by the media. People generally aren't going to believe you, the gamer, are a reliable source, but if they read about it in the newspaper or hear some celeberity speak about gaming without any scorn in their voice, it gains a veneer of respectability. For example, Stephen Colbert's been asked a few times about his time playing DnD as a youth and he's only had positive things to say about it. I think that's the one and only time I've seen gaming mentioned on TV without it being ridiculed. <br/><br/>The archetypal social retard DnD player is always going to be an albatross around the neck of story games, however, and he's not going to be converted. There's not much you can do about that except bear the weight and constantly remind people that there's more to gaming than punching a beholder in the face.                        </div>

                            Larry, I'm right there with you. Cargo cult-like issues are part of the problem. I agree -- I don't expect this to be any different. But, from where I'm sitting it IS different. That is, I believe it has MORE problems than the average joe and/or hobby, and that's troubling. <br/><br/>I'm not after zero problems. I'm after getting rid of the overload of problems that few in this subculture want to admit to, let alone confront. See several posts in this thread saying stuff like "It's not MY problem of Normalz have a problem with me. Fuck them. I do what I want, and wear my geek pride." This is accepted behavior here. I think that's fucked up.<br/><br/>Again, because I can't say it enough: <br/><br/>I'm interested in separating the subculture from the activity of role-playing. And, thus, being able to improve the pool of people might wish to participate in the activity, but have no interest in the sub-culture. (That's why I find the attitude I mentioned above fucked up, because it's actively dis-interested in acknowledging there might be a difference.)<br/><br/>Let's go back to that bowler analogy. Is there a bowling sub-culture? I stereotypically remember it as a bunch of overweight guys, cigarettes and beer galore, and cheesy carpeting. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that this is indeed the sub-culture (it's probably not anymore). I want nothing to do with those guys. But, I think bowling the activity is a lot of fun. <br/><br/>Whereas, in gaming, sure that might happen from time to time. But, I think we can agree that is far and away the exception and not the rule. The rule is that it's assumed you're "in" because the activity and the identity are conflated by the subculture. I mean, hell, I have witnessed people joking about "you're one of us now!" bullshit, and that's all considered natural, good, geek fun. I think it's scary that we think it's so natural and funny.                        </div>

                            Matt, on subculture... geek culture, like it or not, does provide one really important function for gaming that it probably doesn't need to for other geek hobbies. It provides a library of common culture that we use to converge on a SIS. To my mind, that's something that doesn't get enough attention from a lot of indie design. If you want to get away from the assumptions of geek culture, you have to have some symbolic library to replace it with, or solid procedures for creating one in play.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>And I totally don't see instances of people thinking they are cool for what they own.  Fetishism for Great Objects of Our Hobby is one thing, but I think that's a genuine fetishism, and not about social issues ('wanting to be cool'). It seems Matt is mixing the two together.</blockquote>Same here. I mean, maybe I'm oblivious but I can't remember seeing some gamer go all "You know, I have the Dune game, worship me" (Or DitV, MLwM, Nobilis, whatever.) I've seen people buy things they think look beautifull, I have seen people buy stuff because people they respect have told them it's good (Or beautifull, or cool.), but I can't see why anybody would object to that. In fact, saying "People who buy Nobilis because it's beautifully produced are somehow doubleplus notgood" seems like complete bullshit to me.<br/><br/>So that leaves the "People buy things and believe that makes themselves cool", which, I agree, would be stupid. But I have never, ever seen that happen with RPGs. So I have no idea where the OP is coming from, really.<br/><br/>M                        </div>

                            Mark: that's a very important point, and that ties in to the analogy Bent made about comics.  <br/><br/>Over the last 30 years or so, beginning with Crumb, Pekar, Spiegelman and others, comics have changed their imaginative content enormously.  Comics aren't for imbeciles, only to the extent that their contents aren't, y'know, for imbeciles.  "Maus," "David Boring," "American Splendor", "Sea Guy"--these are all awesome bits of pop culture that every adult should experience.  The latest issue of Spider-Man?  Nah, that's for kids (or would be, if kids still read comics.) <br/><br/>There's this perception among the public that there are probably some interesting comic books out there, if you can find them.  But boy, you walk into a comic book store, and it's usually a pretty embarrassing place to be.<br/><br/>Likewise, I think part of the relationship between RPG's and the sub-culture, is that RPG's are all about sub-culture stuff--essentially, dudes with p0w3rz.  If the content of your game is about lasersharks, the audience for the game is going to be a subset of the lasershark audience--i.e., people who already buy into the geek subculture.  <br/><br/>Like, among the indie games that I, personally, am familiar with?  "Primetime Adventures" and "Breaking the Ice" are totally non-sub-culture.  Maybe some of the newer games like Contenders and Best Friends; I don't know 'em. <br/><br/>But I don't think you'll ever manage to scrape the geek-squish off your shoes, if your game is about space ships, magic, and goblins.                        </div>

I don't think this is just about "content" - that is, lots of stuff with spaceships and magic and cool powers aren't enjoyed <i>only</i> by members of the geek subculture (like <i>Star Wars</i>, Stephen King novels, Harry Potter, and the Spider-Man movies).  (Numbers-wise, in fact, geek fans are far outnumbered by non-geek fans when it comes to these things).  The issue, though, is the difference in <i>attitude</i> towards these movies, books, etc.<br/><br/>People, in general, can tell the difference between someone who likes <i>Star Wars </i>and someone who's whole life revolves around it.  But there is a general perception that you can't enjoy RPGs without being <i>totally</i> into them, in the way that people realize you can enjoy reading the latest Harry Potter book without having to decorate your house so it looks like Hogwarts.                        </div>

I've seen people thinking that X is cool, but I can't think of anybody I've met, here or in meatspace, who thought that having X makes him cool. (At least not in gaming. I've seen people who were into their car a bit like that, also with activities like Sex or drug use, but with games? Nope.)<br/><br/>But, if this thing is as common as some people here seem to think (At the very least the OP cares enough about it to start this thread.), I'd love to see a few examples of this stuff happening online. (Mainly because flying over to another users home so he can show me this coworker who <i>totally</i> does that is kinda hard. ^_^ ) It can certainly be that i just missed it.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>Over the last 30 years or so, beginning with Crumb, Pekar, Spiegelman and others, comics have changed their imaginative content enormously.  Comics aren't for imbeciles, only to the extent that their contents aren't, y'know, for imbeciles.  "Maus," "David Boring," "American Splendor", "Sea Guy"--these are all awesome bits of pop culture that every adult should experience.  The latest issue of Spider-Man?  Nah, that's for kids (or would be, if kids still read comics.)</blockquote>
The comics have also slowly been growing out the certain Geek themery of superheroes and assosicated stuff; once the folks outside the comics subculture started to realize that there's something else than kid's stuff in comics, the whole artform slowly started to gain some notice. Even if there had been something else than the kid's stuff there for a long time.<br/><br/>The problem with roleplaying games is that we cover everything with the security blanket of our popular culture, the Geek Stuff, as perceived by the outsiders. If the outsider perspective has been moving away from adolescent fantasy images, it's only been moving to be something like Matrix the movie and Rice's novels, at the best. Even if we have games which deal with, say, human relationships, it has to be covered with demons or occult or whatever. If roleplaying as hobby wants to reach out for the masses - even some of them - we'd better stop looking and especially being like the cheap paperback fantasy section in the bookshop.<br/><br/>The other security blank we hug into is gaming. It would be so totally relieving seeing someone finally having guts to drop the Game from roleplaying, even if for a little while, and do something which wouldn't tie us to the (war)gaming roots.                        </div>

                            Hey Joe,<br/><br/><span style="color: #CC0000;">I am constructing my identity, in part, through the kind of consumer that I am. Sometimes I'm buying things SOLELY to construct my identity and the physical reflection of that identity.<br/><br/>Is that a bad thing? Is that not part of how all identities are constructed?</span><br/><br/>The short answer is, no.<br/><br/>The longer answer: Education in western society is a dramatic failure at identity formation. And as a result, young adults have great difficulty knowing if a specific product purchase is going to make them happy, have great difficulty telling if someone is lying to them, struggle with loneliness and alienation, and with choosing a career path of lasting interest, and have great difficulty finding romantic relationships that make their lives good. The problem is that when teenagers are most hungry for identity formation (during high school) we force them a dunning diet of science and math. But the human moment for identity formation simply won't be denied, and so in their personal lives they date frenetically, and shallowly, rabidly chase fashion, and shop and spend like fiends, looking desperately for identity in all the wrong places. Is society's growing divorce rate really a surprise? We don't understand others because we don't understand ourselves. We ache with chronic buyer's remorse, and see the whole world as a clamor of disgusting monsters who aren't us. Socrates didn't kitbash his identity from cultural iconography, consumables, and throw-away relationships. Identity is a construct of values and decisions. You find it by engaging in an exploration of the human endeavor, making value judgements, and then testing them. (Education in western society needs a powerful correction of course back toward the humanities. In the earlier 20th century you went to college because you'd made an identity decision about the work you wanted to do, and you needed to take on advanced skills or knowledge to do that work. My high school had a very strong computer programming curriculum back in the early 80s. I went to college a declared computer programming major. And I ended up with a degree in English literature and language. Not because I discovered that I wanted to teach high school, but because the unmet need for identity formation would not be denied. Our leaders bemoan the lack of skilled technical graduates from post-secondary schools. It seems illogical, but the actual solution is renewing the humanities in secondary school.)<br/><br/>Joe, if I might say, you already know this. You know the kitbashing isn't meeting your needs. If immersion in the humanities is the more self-guided path of identity formation, modern roleplaying games offer the more social path. And the best designers I know aren't designing games as teaching tools for others, but in fact, games they hope personally to learn from. You wouldn't be designing games like Perfect if you didn't know this.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

I agree.  One of my questions in the, "What don't you understand about gaming?" thread was, "Why did it take me this long?"  And really, the answer is the same as the reason it took me so long to get into reading and buying comics.  I was intimidated.<br/><br/>Comics.  I loved a lot of the subject matter; I'm a happily geeky girl, I love me some magic and goblins and superhuman powers.  But for me, access to the stuff was the most difficult thing -- I found the comic stores intimidating, and it wasn't until my local library started getting graphic novels and I started to become familiar with what I liked, that I felt comfortable venturing into the store to find more.  I honestly think one of the reasons comics are taking off is that it's easier to find them in mainstream bookstores and libraries -- there isn't the same barrier to the casual dabbler.<br/><br/>I think that it's much the same way with RPGs/storygames; right now, they're hard to find if you don't go to a speciality store, and it's really difficult to get into them if you don't have someone who offers to teach you.  It's not so much a question of subject matter as access.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I think expanding the subject matter of storygames at the same time as making access easier could certainly help; I could see a more "real world" RPG acting as a "gateway" to more fantastic games and settings, in much the same way that people who picked up and enjoyed <i>From Hell</i> might then be drawn to <i>The Watchmen</i> or <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i>.                        </div>

Interesting. Has anybody donated <i>games</i> to libraries, or know of any companies that have done such a thing?<br/><br/>I periodically have dreams where I'm in a school library or something, and they have an extremely comprehensive inventory of game books to borrow. For real.                        </div>

                            When I lived in Ridgecrest California, a little shit town in the middle of nowhere, the local library had AD&amp;D first edition and Champions (2nd?). It was pretty awesome to be able to check the Fiend Folio out of the library. <br/><br/>Hmm, I have a big stack of games I was going to eBay. Maybe I'll give them to the TPL instead.                        </div>

                            The accepted wisdom seems to be that RPG books are high-theft items in libraries, and thus poor bang for your collection-development buck. However, I wonder about the viability of non-circulating copies coupled with organized play at the library?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: crowyhead</cite>But for me, access to the stuff was the most difficult thing -- I found the comic stores intimidating, and it wasn't until my local library started getting graphic novels and I started to become familiar with what I liked, that I felt comfortable venturing into the store to find more.</blockquote>
Heh. I recently went to mail-order comics subs at least in part because I was tired of dealing with geek-dominance slagging of my purchases by the staff at the comic shop most convenient to me.                        </div>

                            I first started buying comics in the 6th grade from the local pharmacy. They had a decent rack of magazines and comics in it. Small family owned business, the dad and son ran it, sometimes they even had a cashier. So never had that intimidation factor.<br/>
<br/>
Our local gaming guild has a library of games and books donated to be borrowed by any member. I am getting ready to donate 2 printer paper boxes worth of books and magazines to it. It is a long list of lots of stuff, 7 years worth of accumulation                        </div>

                            My home town's library now hosts a Warhammer night in addition to Chess night. RPing wouldn't be a big leap. They don't have any rulebooks on hand now, but I'm sure would keep any donations. So...libraries can be open to gaming; just depends on who's working there.                        </div>

                            Matt, I just didn't want to sidetrack your thread by strongly disagreeing with you, but if that's what you want...<br/><br/>It sounds like you're hating on part of the core audience and consumer market for roleplaying games.  One of the main reasons publishers continue publishing books that are more "artifacts to own" than "experiences to enact" is the existing market has proven succeptible to those kinds of marketing decisions and those products are often rather successful.  I think trying to change the purchasing and play habits of a large number of existing roleplayers is misguided.  A much more succesful approach, in my mind, would be writing games for a different audience (frex, existing roleplayers who would appreciate a different approach and other potential audiences) and leaving consumers who don't feel the same way to their shiney toys.  They seem to be enjoying themselves and I thought we weren't really about hating on other people's fun.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not sure who're you're talking to in this thread.  Mo is 100% correct that people within the "indie scene" often judge each other by the games they've played and enjoyed.  But your point seems to be more aimed at people who buy pretty games to feel special.  Are you suggesting that lots of Story Games readers are those kinds of people?  Are you talking crap about some hypothetical mainstream roleplayers who aren't even really here to defend themselves?  Are you just bringing up a facet of the way the roleplaying hobby works right now and trying to get people riled up about it?  If so, for what purpose?  Sure, I dislike the extensive commodification of roleplaying texts and wisdom.  What should I do about it?                        </div>
