Best Interests that are not easily solved by confrontation and conflict (especially violent conflict) are often the most interesting. Make sure you, as a group, have some of those, although violent/stabby ones are fun too. A mix is best.<br/><br/>2. Don't get hung up on the Challenge and Answer and who narrates what thing. It's actually pretty simple.<br/><br/>All that talk about theory and "inside-out stakes" and how people don't get it makes it sound kind of complicated, but it's not. It's just like this:<br/><br/>Challenge: Say what you do. (It  should be something important your opponent can't ignore.)<br/><br/>Answer: Say what the effects of the Challenge are. How did your character take the attack/action? Are they flat on their back, or do they deftly dodge the attack and end up in a better position? <br/><br/>It's totally like, "I roll to hit you" and, "you narrate what the damage, if any, looks like". I narrate the action, and your narrate its effect on you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott%20Dorward" title="Scott Dorward"><img alt="Scott Dorward" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott%20Dorward">Scott Dorward</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176459/#Comment_176459" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T15:23:06+00:00" title="October 27, 2008  3:23PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>So answer things, bring in cool stuff, draw maps, describe stuff.

I've played about a half dozen sessions of IAWA, with a variety of players, and the only one that was unsatisfying was with a group that felt that, because their characters were designed to be in conflict, the game had to be all face stabbing, all the time.  This meant that the session was just a blur of conflict after conflict, with no real story or roleplaying in between (despite me repeatedly suggesting that it didn't have to be played this way).  The punchline was a couple of the players afterwards saying, 'I didn't like that.  It was just a load of conflicts.', as if the game had forced them to act like that.<br/><br/>One bit of (in retrospect, quite obvious) advice I'd offer is that, when drawing the Oracle, don't be afraid to redraw an element that doesn't seem to fit with the others or spark your imaginations at the time.  The first session I played was bogged down for about thirty minutes at the start trying to make one incongruous element fit, when it would have been a lot more fun to simply jettison it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176469/#Comment_176469" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T16:10:33+00:00" title="October 27, 2008  4:10PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The ideal set of dice for a player of In A Wicked Age are:<br/><br/>Easy to read<br/>All the same color for the same player<br/>Have both 1d6 with numerals and 1d6 with pips.<br/><br/>All 3 of these speed up play because the person across from you can see what the result is, whose dice they are, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176541/#Comment_176541" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T07:25:49+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  7:25AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Scott Dorward</cite>One bit of (in retrospect, quite obvious) advice I'd offer is that, when drawing the Oracle, don't be afraid to redraw an element that doesn't seem to fit with the others or spark your imaginations at the time.

Ideally, you should be approaching the dice like you do in something like, um, any second gen post-D&amp;D system you can think of (Shadowrun, Rifts, Hero, GURPS, etc.). The dice are often a very bad way to achieve what you want, so you should roll them in moderation, when no other option seems viable. Unlike Dogs, they don't structure the conflict by leading you towards a conclusion or allowing you to figure out what the conflict is really about in the midst of it.  They simply provide structure when you really want to take someone out, but what happens is still almost entirely up to you, whatever the dice say.  That's why, as Brand mentioned at one point, you invoke the dice when someone says, "Oh no you don't, asshole!" (as opposed to just "Say yes or roll the dice"), when someone has declared an action that is so intolerable that you want to immediately oppose them hard, which shouldn't be the default.<br/><br/>I spent much of my early Rifts and In Nomine years avoiding rolling the dice (because it messes up the story to have random shit happen!), but had gotten so much Story Games brain damage (rolling the dice is more better!), that it messed me up when I initially approached IAWA.  If you don't have a conflict every 2-3 scenes, it does not mean your game is lame or even unexciting.  If it's unexciting, it's because something else is wrong.  The dice themselves don't bring excitement, necessarily.<br/><br/>EDIT: This also connects to Brand's advice to take your time.  Take your time all over the place, not just with set up.  Let conflicts emerge on their own; don't try to force them by walking around and kicking folks in the teeth (metaphorically).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176628/#Comment_176628" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T16:33:28+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  4:33PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's something easy to overlook:<br/><br/>IAWA is a game that you can get better at.
