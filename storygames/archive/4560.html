An operational definition of the function is "the artificial replication of a situation of competition or conflict not involving actual military forces, and is characterized by human decision-making which impacts the course of events throughout. It revolves around the interaction of two or more opposing forces guided by predetermined objectives, rules, data, and procedures designed to depict an actual or assumed real world situation." Wargaming is particularly suitable for generating, refining, and assessing concepts, plans, issues, and technologies; assessing alternatives (COAs, etc.); identifying capabilities and deficiencies; replicating conditions difficult to reproduce in peacetime; and reducing surprises.<br/></blockquote>\nThat doesn't sound <strong>too</strong> far removed from our discipline, does it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103208/#Comment_103208" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T06:36:03+00:00" title="October 16, 2007  6:36AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The military and homeland security establishments, in the U.S., and swimming in money for this sort of thing.

This is taken from my experience working with multi-million dollar* NGO granting programs, so obviously some of the advice is going to be pretty much focused on just that avenue.<br/><br/>You open yourself up for a stronger case to arts grants if you incorporate delivery into your project. If you ask for significantly more, but include touring community to community and kickstarting the success of this new roleplaying game, you are more likely to be considered. A lot of grants create materials that sit on dusty shelves - implimentation and follow-through are worth a lot (both money and consideration).<br/><br/>Transfer of skills is important with community education or adult literacy grants. A game which taught you applicable, real-world skills (just like SIerra's educational computer games for children, or those How would you survive? scenario books) would be worth a lot of grant money to many organizations. Especially if you could prove results. Hopefully something less cheesy than, "How has your life improved since playing my game? Please fill out this survey!"<br/><br/>Measurable results, ongoing reporting, and ongoing goal assessment are what change a lacking application into one you really consider. If there's no way to tell if the game is a success, or the design process is continuing smoothly, or if skills are being transfered through play (for example), then you're asking for blind faith on behalf of granters. Find a way to say "We will measure success in these ways. We will stop to assess our successes and redevelop our task objectives at these points. We will report our findings at this point and this point."<br/><br/><br/>That's just general tips for the kind of granting I've been involved with. Focusing your project on how you will deliver something to the public and how you will gauge success makes a huge difference.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*As in, the program/organization granted millions annually, not as in we gave out single grants worth a million.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103428/#Comment_103428" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T09:17:46+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  9:17AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            " Rather than dismissing them out of hand, we could actually look into them "<br/><br/>Ben, who dismissed them out of hand?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103432/#Comment_103432" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T09:24:06+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  9:24AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            joepub - those are all great suggestions!

Especially when you take it to the community level. Teaching a skill like consensus-based decision making, or conversely making decisions using Robert's Rules of Order... those could both be considered personal development or adult literacy skill improvements. Similarly, fostering personal creativity, encouraging people to share their stories and imagination, and channelling that energy into an ongoing product (SIS) is a brilliant youth literacy project.<br/><br/>Literacy grants exist, and are significant, and there's a lot of drift that exists within their mandate boundaries.<br/><br/>While I don't think they are the only grant field that RPG designers could pursue, they are definitely a strong one. That, and general arts grants. Some places/organizations will also offer cultural development grants*. Something like a roleplaying game fair (basically, a con set up for outsiders) or gaming magazine or ongoing cross-gaming-group events could be funded by this, but there'd be quite a bit of drift to get an actual game writing grant from cultural development funds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*Note, there are two things that are both called cultural development. One is about a specific religious or ethnic cultural background. The other is about developing community around ongoing events, lifestyles and commonalities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103467/#Comment_103467" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T12:15:46+00:00" title="October 17, 2007 12:15PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!
