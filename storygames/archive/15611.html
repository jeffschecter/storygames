She granted it.<br/><br/>On November 9, a message on Geraldine \u201cJer\u201d Parchman\u2019s answering machine at the Santa Monica Pier from Eric indicated that he was looking into events in Wheeler Springs, a Friendly Town approximately two hours northeast of Los Angeles.  These events were connected to the apparently accidental death of Lori E. Phillips, a church official, which had taken place earlier that year.<br/><br/>On November 10, Jer tried to call him back.  Eric\u2019s cellphone was listed as no longer in service.<br/><br/>On November 14, Jer arrived in Wheeler Springs to investigate Eric\u2019s disappearance.<br/><br/><b>Rules Changes</b><br/><br/>The demographic information for the Friendly Town scenario includes:<br/><br/>* the results of the blood test to see if someone is a mutant, if one has occurred.  Test results may be falsified in some cases, so people can secretly be a mutant or wrongly thought to be a mutant.<br/><br/>* whether the person is faithful (attends the Friends church in the town), unfaithful (does not attend), is an outsider (not expected to attend) or is a known mutant (is an enemy of the church.)<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/11-5tuAw83fl_jzyi77Dt5ZGQHj79cMcrtm9DAraHXQs/edit" rel="nofollow">Here's the character/bid track sheet I made</a> on Google Docs.
