Plus a lot of just taking for the last hour or so.<br/><br/>For this one I'm thinking about doing some discussion about failure that is interesting as in Burning Wheel (Any other good examples?) and some stuff about that I haven't thought of yet.<br/>For a second bit is the price of failure or success as in Dogs and don't Rest Your head.<br/><br/>Going by last time I should only schedule myself to talk for about 1.5 hours of the 3 hs. But does any one have some additional suggestions in terms of details for these topics or complementary ones to go with them?<br/>Most of the crowd will be the traditional gamer type, any ideas on how to relate my indieness to their play experiences a bit better?<br/><br/><br/>This post is mostly just fishing for ideas as I think this over for the next few days.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
