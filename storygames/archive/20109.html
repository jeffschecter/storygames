For example, some common and key components of combat are: line of sight, cover, movement, positioning, accuracy and precision.  From what I've seen, games tend to pick and choose out of lists like this, deciding how detailed an experience they want to give ("Are we going full simulationist, more gamey, or straight narrative?").  Now, I find it very easy to break down combat actions into their subsequent components.  I can even break down other kinds of physical activity with relative ease.  Maybe its cause of years of video gaming or maybe its cause these are primarily physical/kinetic tasks so it's easier to break them down into essential pieces.  However, I have a much tougher time deconstructing social interactions.<br/><br/>Are there any similar common and key components to Social combat?  What quantifiable components of social combat can a designer mess with?<br/><br/>In an attempt to help identify some of the parameters of social combat, I've made a small list of what I consider key aspects to social interaction.  This list is nowhere near complete, and it's full of ideas and terms that I've defined a certain way (sometimes not the way that most people would use the term).\n<dl>\n<dt>Sympathy/Empathy with the Target</dt>\n<dd>How well do you know the person OR how well can you read the person.  If you are experienced at noticing the minutia in body language and speech patterns, it is easier to understand the mental/emotional state of the subject you are engaged with.</dd>\n<dt>Ability to express oneself</dt>\n<dd>The very basic ability to communicate your thoughts and project your intentions to a target.  The more "expressive" you can be, the more succinctly you can communicate an idea or intention.</dd>\n<dt>Colloquial Etiquette/Expression</dt>\n<dd>Expressing yourself in a manner that is expected by and consistent with your environment.  Knowing the appropriate behavior for your environment. The term <span style="text-decoration: underline;">colloquial</span> refers to the social environment you find yourself in.  If your environment is the streets, its knowing the lexicon to say that you have a key of fishscales ready to go and knowing not to mention any names on the phone.  Likewise, if you're environment is an upper class social club, this is your understanding of how to make a witty comment that is just sharp enough to barb your opponent without being too overbearing.</dd>\n<dt>Ability to shield your own tells</dt>\n<dd>The conscious or unconscious ability to guard yourself from being read too closely.  Or, preventing others from seeing the intention behind your words/behavior too clearly.  Essentially, presenting what you want to present while hiding what you want to hide.</dd>\n</dl>\nMy intention was to create a lexicon for myself that I can build off and say, "I'll target this aspect of social combat and work out ways to mechanize it."  What other aspects of social interaction am I missing?  What aspects listed deserve their own section or should not be on that list?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444236/#Comment_444236" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-18T17:46:06+00:00" title="March 18, 2015  5:46PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2015 6:01PM by Rickard.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't naming it \xbbsocial <i>combat</i>\xab give the wrong assumptions of how it should be handled?

Emotions, on the other hand, colors the conversation. Imagine talking about a banana but having the either one of the emotions jealousy, love, fear, or calmness. How you would address the topic would change drastically depending on that single emotion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444238/#Comment_444238" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-18T18:08:24+00:00" title="March 18, 2015  6:08PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Doesn't naming it \xbbsocial combat\xab give the wrong assumptions of how it should be handled?</blockquote>\nTotally agree. It's why that list is intended to be a list of the components of social <i>interaction</i>. How that can be transferred to combat, conversation, etc. is something I'm going to try to explore once I have a solid Macro understanding of the components of social interaction. I should have probably named the thread Social interaction as opposed to combat. I think I chose combat, because that's the frequent mode of thinking of mechanized social interaction in an RPG. Still, I'm very guilty of oscillating between the terms combat and interaction w/o careful regard for the connotation it sets up.\n<blockquote>Very few people can hide their tells because that's something you have to train, like if you're a politician or a poker player.</blockquote>\nAgain, I agree with you that this is more of a trained skill rather than an innate ability. In fact, its part of why I'm not sure if it deserves to be on that list or not. On the one hand, people try this untrained every day. The girl at the coffee shop greets you with the false exuberance the company instills in her. But if you hang around for a bit, that mask will drop and she'll be complaining to her coworkers about something or another. This led me to include it as a natural part of social interaction, but I think facility with it is certainly a matter of training.  So, does it belong up there? Or does it lean too heavily on the spectrum of "things to be trained," so shouldn't rightly be included in a list of the macro components of social interaction?\n<blockquote><i>Emotions</i> is something that is part of communication but also <i>the way a person communicate</i>.</blockquote>\nThis is a pretty good point. Going back and looking at that list I have, I notice they're all geared towards something that can be trained in or advanced through application and experience. I'm not so certain this is a good way to approach this whole subject. Emotion is something that is very hard to control and sometimes simply cannot be, but I think it is definitely a key component in social interaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444241/#Comment_444241" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-18T19:11:22+00:00" title="March 18, 2015  7:11PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Act like a sociopath: find others inner fears and aversions, play them to get what you want without revealing that you know and are manipulating<br/><br/>Act like a human: you have inner fears and aversions, people are generally reasonable and will help with minor requests, overcome your own hangups and you just succeed<br/><br/>Act like a debater: screw emotions, try arguments and bribes.

It can reveal the true intentions of a person and/or make her prone to mistakes or rushing to conclussions.<br/><b>Empathy:</b> The ability to perceive other people's emotions and reflect it to gain their trust<br/>Pure emotion can be used instead of empathy if you're being completely honest about your intentions. I'm taking empathy here as a conscious effort to control the emotional output. Also, an actor could use a "performance" or "acting" skill instead of this, if it's higher (that would mean he has an actual method for acting)<br/><b>Reason/Logic:</b> the ability to find, relate and arrange one or several convincing arguments, either if they are true or not, or if the character actually believes them himself. It can also be used to see through other people's bullshit or even to invent excuses to yourself for anything. A failure in that would lead to rising your Emotion (Guilt) ranking, for example. Actually, this same stat could be used as a stress threshold: if any emotion goes higher than the Reason of the character, he stops thinking and starts acting.<br/><br/>As stated above, other learned skills could be used instead of empathy and reason/logic, if they are higher (more trained)<br/><br/>Dunno if anyone can see through my descrption, but I've thought this design in terms of game possibilities. I'd recommend that way of thiking for any design you want to try. Check every variable and think "What kind of game situations may arise if this value is high or low?" "What other variables are similar and can be bring together into a single variable with a wider descriptor?" "Which ones generate enough interesting complexity to be separated into new ones?" In the case above, it perhaps a bit minimalistic but I think it can produce several different interesting results.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444245/#Comment_444245" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-18T20:08:54+00:00" title="March 18, 2015  8:08PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2015 8:10PM by Luzelli.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> I like what you have there, but I'm curious: Are you leaving off the idea of actually expressing yourself because you feel it's already split across the 3 axis system you present?

For example, My character may not be too smart but he could have a skill that makes him quick with words (even if he doesn't know their meaning) so he could try that to outsmart an intelligent character. So etiquette would matter for the character that knows about it. I'd make that into a class related skill. Like, thieves have thieves cant and nobles have etiquette, wariors have their own slang and characters would need an additional skill to know more about other people's dialects.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444250/#Comment_444250" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-18T22:01:50+00:00" title="March 18, 2015 10:01PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm seeing a Venn Diagram.

It's logical to go sociopathic on the system once it's established that way, because players are confronted to a game about resource management, where trust, rapport, love and friendship have become resources that can be controlled by whoever exhibits a predetermined behavior. It would be best if no dice rolling was involved on roleplaying characters, but there will always be GMs and players with too poor social skills that would prefer to roll the dice to avoid uncomfortable talking and acting. And we can't forget about truly uncomfortable scenes that are best avoided or resumed into a dice roll. Talking about never-ending cycles...<br/><br/>Thinking about that and other things, let me re-state a mechanic:<br/><br/>Whenever a social interaction scene implicates an exchange (of resources, services, status, information, conditions, demands, etc) that can be solved inmediatly or that they would like to see develop because it could add an interesting twist to the story, players should use the situation to define the Emotion variable for each character. Let's take a d20 system as an example, scale it up later to the system of your choice.<br/><br/>Emotion should start at 5 (1/4 of the highest dice value of the system) and get modified according to the situation (+1d6 if the argument has been going on for a while without solution, if there has been previous hostilities, etc). We will use INT score as Reason/logic threshold. Once emotion goes higher that that score, the emotion it's evident for other people, though you may want to apply WIS modifier of the observers if it's negative: for those people, detecting emotions on others would be difficult anyway.<br/><br/>If Emotion hasn't gone beyond the INT score, to find out what that emotion is, players make Empathy rolls against reason logic rolls of the oponent. These rolls could use any skill or stat the palyer wants. Sense motive,  insight, perception, spot, wisdom, investigation, you name it.<br/><br/>To either control and/or hide the own emotions as well as for interacting with others you can use any skill for the Reason/Logic roll: Diplomacy, intimidate, persuasion, leadership, concentration, Intelligence, etiquette, seduction, etc. This roll will either hide emotions, or make them go up or down. The actual score and the emotion won't be know by anyone but the GM (if it's an NPC) and the player (if it's his character, until it goes beyond the logic/reason threshold. Then the emotion and it's intensity is clear for everyone as the character loses it's temper.<br/><br/>You can try to influentiate another character's emotion even if you don't know what it is. It's like the real world: you never know what someone is thinking until they state it clearly, go mad or break up in tears. Perhaps you will never know, even when you tried so hard to make them react.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444319/#Comment_444319" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-20T00:26:24+00:00" title="March 20, 2015 12:26AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2015 12:34AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Luzelli, I think your initial 4 categories and some of the subsequent suggestions cover varying levels of specificity.

Anyway, without worrying about which of these items belong inside which other items, here's my list of things you might want to do in a social interaction:<br/>- create an impression of value -- why they want what you're offering<br/>- create an impression of danger -- why they fear what you're threatening<br/>- establish credibility -- prove that whatever you're tempting them with is real<br/>- establish trust -- make them believe you'll follow through on your end<br/>- fix prices -- establish how much each side's part is worth to the other side<br/>- convincingly relay true info<br/>- convincingly relay false info<br/>- provide evidence<br/>- create urgency -- get them to commit before gathering other info<br/>- control the focus of the conversation -- keep it about what you want it to be about<br/>- distract<br/>- obfuscate<br/>- dismiss<br/>- make them look good for whoever else is there, if they do what you want<br/>- make them look good for whoever else is there, period<br/>- make them look bad for whoever else is there, if they don't do what you want<br/>- make them look bad for whoever else is there, period<br/>- diffuse a grudge or animosity<br/>- calm them so they deal with you rationally<br/>- shock or alarm them so they deal with you confusedly<br/>- fluster them so they do something that's bad for them<br/>- get them to like you -- bring a positive disposition into future dealings<br/>- get them to value your favor -- act for, not against, your interests in the future<br/>- set it in stone -- make it harder to back out of an arrangement<br/>- put it on the books -- create policy that governs others<br/>- notice when they lie<br/>- learn their values<br/>- learn their goals and priorities<br/>- learn their secrets -- what don't they want generally known?<br/>- establish confidentiality -- make them believe you'll safeguard their secrets<br/>- act covertly -- avoid giving away their secrets<br/>- manipulation -- get them to behave as you desire, for whatever purpose<br/>- evoke in them a certain emotion<br/>- mesmerize them<br/>- get them aroused<br/>- get them to fall in love<br/>- get them to discard protection and leverage -- e.g. in a room alone<br/>- get them to like your side -- party, faction, nation, whoever you represent<br/>- get them to hate your enemies/competitors<br/>- create the desired image of yourself -- e.g. you may want to seem incompetent<br/>- learn all they know<br/>- crush their spirit<br/>- coerce<br/>- bribe<br/>- drug<br/>- alter your appearance<br/>- control your body language<br/>- control your facial expressions<br/>- control your voice -- pitch, timber, accent, cadence, diction, everything<br/>- impersonate -- locale, role, rank, specific person                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444325/#Comment_444325" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-20T01:09:22+00:00" title="March 20, 2015  1:09AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a fucking awesome list, Dave.

So... however long it took my fingers.  <br/><br/>I've been working on social conflict mechanics for a while, trying out various emphases.  All this stuff was already at the front of my brain.<br/><br/>For my inchoate game Blackmailed Kingdoms, I want to be able to model pretty complex negotiations, where, for example, a player character who's a rich ambassador of a powerful nation can trade a promise of eventual aid to a local militia leader for immediate help in a fight, but only with the right amount of cash for weapons as a sweetener, plus the right amount of public deference to boost the leader's standing with his own people.  \n<blockquote>\u2022 How prepared are you for this negotiation?  Are you even aware of all the relevant factors?  Do you have any inside information or assistance?<br/><br/>\u2022 How do you establish that your word is good?  How can you come to trust the help you're getting for the fight?  How much cash are you willing to part with?  How can you use what leverage you have without giving a public insult or challenge that the militia leader will feel obligated to attack you for?  <br/><br/>\u2022 If you can't get what you want, can you still leave, unattacked, with this guy as more friend than enemy?  Can you spot a different opportunity for gain, so as not to waste what it cost you to set up this meeting in the first place?</blockquote>\nThose are the sorts of things I'd love to bring into play as genuine strategic elements.  Rolling to get what you want on a "yes, but", "no, and" etc. table can easily produce all the same fictional outcomes, but it's the decision-making process that really appeals to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444353/#Comment_444353" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-20T18:44:58+00:00" title="March 20, 2015  6:44PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> Wow!

This happens all the time, you don't need to mechanize achieving it, so much as highlight it. The other half of this is the judgement side of "what relationship is this" - and that is a very open area. Years ago I designed an entire game built on structure of convincing other players that your character had become friends, enemies, or lovers with another specific character.<br/><br/>Another big chunk of social interaction involves communicating information. We have enough trouble with this during RPG play we tend to downplay this in the fiction. Certainly there are some alternatives to asking if anyone in the party speaks Gnomish. <br/><br/>Some social interaction involves inflicting emotional harm - I think of this as emotional combat. This is very common in drama. It represents when people are fighting, struggling for dominance, generating emotional blackmail, falling in or struggling to escape destructive or abusive relationships. I happen to like framing this in D&amp;D combat style, with emotional armor and hit points and various nasty maneuvers. After all, emotional violence is still violence. <br/><br/>Even less social interaction involves influencing or changing beliefs and behaviors. In reality these often involve leveraging relationships or harm to encourage or discourage changes in the other person. This can also involve using the tools of confidence, cognitive tricks to exploit biases, and even sometimes the tools of rationality. Lies are harder because confidence and consistency may be more difficult for the persuader, but just because something is true or you believe it to be true, doesn't make the process of persuasion much easier. Beliefs versus behaviors is an important distinction: one interrogator could be trying to get a suspect to believe they should tell the truth, while a different interrogator could be trying to get a suspect to slip up and mention something they would habitually keep secret. <br/><br/>There is also the halo of non-interactive social elements: dressing to impress, cold reading, hiding tells - most of which involve either the complexities of culture or perception. There are also group dynamics, which largely build on maintaining relationships and communicating information, but also involve the way groups evolve (and occasionally develop) social tools, shared experiences, unspoken assumptions, and implicit hierarchies. If you extrapolate that even further you enter the realm of politics and culture, as well as social formalisms like laws. <br/><br/> - Mendel<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444375/#Comment_444375" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-21T20:17:46+00:00" title="March 21, 2015  8:17PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even in the most adversarial and formalized social situations, which I am in regularly, combat is not a good metaphor.

For Potemkin's fast-paced OSR experience a simple zero-sum game is probably totally sufficient.  For a more detailed "simulation" experience a more complex mechanic is required, and this makes the differences between zero-sum games and multivariant spaces painfully evident - which is why we've all seen NPC dialog-response mechanics that seemed woefully... um... mechanical.  We end up ditching them and improvising.<br/><br/>One answer might be to borrow narrativist "oracle" techniques (which are similar in many ways to surrealist literary techniques) and mount them on top of such a mechanic.  Written flexibly and evocatively, they might cover the joints in the mechanic with narrative prompts which spur the interpretive powers of the person narrating.<br/><br/>I would love to think that one could achieve a "one size fits all situations" model by keeping the actionable terms vague but suggestive. Maybe it's possible. But my vocabulary is pretty large and I haven't hit on it yet, despite lots of trying.<br/><br/>In <i>DayTrippers</i> I included a mechanic I call a "Complex Dialog Action" which simulates any kind of extended verbal interaction in which multiple stakes are at risk (arguing a legal case, for instance).  The variables used for both parties' rolls depend on the characters themselves; could be a skill, could be their innate CHARM stat. For each stake, rolls are modified and compared, and the result will usually be a bipartite "YES AND", "NO BUT", etc.  Then somebody gets a -1 on their next stake roll.  This seemed sufficient to me.<br/><br/>But in playtesting I found this to be a place people sometimes get stuck. Interpreting the "BUTs" and "ANDs" of an imagined conversation gives people pause in a way that interpreting combat mishaps doesn't. Perhaps it's because we haven't HEARD the actual WORDS that apparently caused the secondary result, and it's not something you can run back and picture in your mind like a combat scene in this here room on the map with these dimensions and these other contents... so it's hard to think of what the secondary result might reasonably be.  And that's why the GM Guide (wip) will break out Complex Dialog into a separate table of its own, adding short lists of suggestive phrases to help contextualize the results.  It's less elegant, but hopefully more useful.<br/><br/>I don't know much about biogenetics, Roy.

RPG combat isn't like real world combat either. I'm just saying as a guy who persuades other people in rules-heavy situations for a living, "combat" doesn't feel like what I do. I've never seen a social combat system that feels like social interaction to me.<br/><br/>Last week I had a lying person on the witness stand and a GChat message in my hand showing that they lied. I had to persuade a third person (a judge) that the witness is a liar, but I couldn't talk to the judge (right now), I could only talk to the liar.<br/><br/>"So let's look at this message together, okay?" I say.  We're doing this together. We're gonna work through this together.  <br/><br/>"Here in this part you are talking about something - and your message says Ms. AAA could choose to 'stash', 'sell' or 'do' what you were going to give her, correct?" Look at my finger, pointing at this piece of paper as I helpfully hold it up, yes, see, we are working together, standing next to each other, yoked as one in our work. <br/><br/>"Ms. AAA says the something you were talking about was prescription pain medication, correct?" I open my body, revealing, sitting across the courtroom, Ms. AAA, look, there she is, how could I not be correct, look at her there. Yes, I'm correct. <br/><br/>"You say you were talking about money, correct?"  Yes, I said that.<br/><br/>"And if you were talking about money, saying that she might choose to stash that money makes sense, right?" Of course! Look how much sense you made in this message. Those dastardly lawyers aren't going to trip YOU up. <br/><br/>"But it wouldn't make much sense to say she could 'sell' it if you were talking about money, I mean, you don't 'sell' money.  You've never 'sold' any money, have you?" Well...no...<br/><br/>"You're not a currency exchange operator?" A big smile! Ha ha, that would be crazy. They would never let a currency exchange operator have a tattoo of an AK-47 on their neck.  <br/><br/>"The mother's not a currency exchange operator to your knowledge?"  Oh, what a pleasant smile we are exchanging, ha ha, of course not.<br/><br/>"And 'do' I mean...'do' REALLY doesn't make any sense if you mean money, you don't 'do' money, do you?" No, of course not, what a silly notion! We are smiling at this silly notion together.<br/><br/>"People don't sell money and people don't do money. Right?" Right. <br/><br/>"You have heard of people selling prescription medication, though." Yes. Wait. Uh oh. You already said yes. <br/><br/>"And you have heard of people 'doing' drugs." NO! WAIT! SHIT! OF COURSE I HAVE, EVERYONE HAS, WHY DID I SAY NO!! I MEAN YES!! <br/><br/>And then I sit down.<br/><br/>I never fought with them - I actually never argued with them at all. I don't argue with witnesses; it's the best way to make everyone in the room love the witness and hate you. I actually think argument changes very few minds; that's not what argument is for or good at.  Most "versus" social interactions are more like trapping. You stealthily place a viable, workable trail, and then try to turn the interaction until their ankle is in the snare.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444385/#Comment_444385" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-22T05:29:09+00:00" title="March 22, 2015  5:29AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It strikes me as being like judo or aikido: you move in harmony with your opposition so that you can bring them to a place where they unravel themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444387/#Comment_444387" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-22T11:16:01+00:00" title="March 22, 2015 11:16AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of arguments are lost because we dont say the right things, only after the argument do we mull over what was said in our heads to see what we could have said. <br/>Why is this ?

For someone like myself who's spent a lifetime training in completely different skill sets, coming to grips with a particular notion like social conflict, combat, what have you, has been difficult. I know what to do, but I don't fully understand the underpinnings behind what I do.  Now, lets talk a bit about that nomenclature:<br/><br/>I specifically chose combat in my thread title because the system I'm working on has a fleshed out way to do one-on-one dueling, so I wanted to mirror that idea in the social sphere. However, as so many of you have pointed out, combat carries a certain connotation which does not always fit the bill. I think JDCorley would say it rarely ever fits the bill.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, let me say, I would hate for this discussion to end because I am gearing for a particular kind of social interaction that is inherently adversarial. So, by all means continue the discourse, because I already have plans to use what's been discussed here to approach social interaction from a completely different perspective. Less adversarial in nature and more about the kinds of subtle manipulation that's been dissected.  Now, for the individual responses:<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>: I wasn't necessarily looking for a social contest involving an audience, in the Burning wheel vein of things. In my game, the players are newly minted human/droid creatures. They may have at one time had a normal life, but they've been kidnapped by/volunteered for the Empire to use them as a part of a new policing program. In effect, they've been turned into a new breed of secret police, given a much greater degree of latitude to perform their duties. Because of their half-construct nature, they have a hard time reconciling their human emotions and their programmed sense of reason and logic. The main antagonists are a group of freedom fighting Insurgents.  So... given all of that, I was trying to create a social system that takes into account attempting to convince Insurgents to return to the fold of the Empire, or stop their terror activities in one part of the regime because it's destabilizing the area and wreaking havoc on the lives of the commoners, whatever.  The point is, it is primarily intended for one on one or PC group on one type situations.  The audience is largely irrelevant.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>: I agree that social combat or conflict doesn't quite encapsulate the subtlety of true social interaction. I find most of what you've elucidated pretty fascinating, however, I do have a few questions: You say that threatening is very probably a form of social combat, however, there are no instances where persuasion is as well? Because by it's nature it is most successful when approached in a non-adversarial context?  Or that persuasion by itself is not combative.  Which is to say, manipulation is just manipulation, it's not necessarily violence or unviolence, it's a different category altogether. Just curious as to your take on that.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Wyrmwood">@Wyrmwood</a>: I like the idea of splitting up social interaction by: Establishing/maintaining relationships, communicating information, inflicting emotional harm, Influencing belief/behavior, and non-interactive elements.  I am certainly stealing that in the future, so don't be surprised <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_88">@Paul_88</a> One thing I've been trying to model for a while is exactly the kind of firewall breach moment you mentioned.  Where you say something unintentional because you're so flustered. Or you feel so cornered you slip and can't make a proper retort, or only afterwards think of what you should have said.  I quite like the notion of figuring out how to mechanize that bit of helplessness, but i'll save that for another day.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a> The idea of using an oracular approach to social interaction is pretty interesting. I would like to hear more about your "Complex Dialog Action" system. What I'm wondering about is the multiple stakes aspect of it.  Is that mechanized? Do players have a score in.. i dont know.. how much they care about porsche's and how much they hate toyota and finally how prejudiced they are against asian corporations.  The end result being they have a high bit of defense against a salesman, like Gill from the Simpsons, trying to sell them a Toyota car they don't want or need?  I mean obviously that interaction is pretty silly, I'm just wondering if you have found a way to quantify the stakes and if it's used as a kind of resistance as well as chink in their armor (so to speak).<br/><br/>Ok, I think I responded to everyone.

In my game "social rules' are invoked if one character is trying to achieve a goal that way.  Commonly that goal is an "inner goal" which means satisfying some emotional need in themselves.<br/><br/>The means they achieve their goal is through emotional manipulation, which is a harsh sounding term, but its accurate enough   It just doesnt necessarily mean cynical intent, but it could.  Attempting to make someone feel better or to like you is still emotional manipulation even if the intent is not malign.<br/><br/>But anyway, each character has a stat called soul which represents, amongst other things, their emotional state/stability.   When one character does or says something designed to elicit an emotion in another character, their soul stats is tested to see if it is successful.  This is all the mechanic does - informs the player of that character that they do, or dont, feel that emotion.  <br/><br/>The player then has the option to repress (hide)or express that emotion.  If they repress it, they temporarily lose one sou point, making them less emotionally stable going forward.  If they express the emotion, they can do it in any way they think is fitting at the time.<br/><br/>So the mechanics are really just there expressing the emotional subtext of the interaction, and the interpretation of that subtext is left to the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444462/#Comment_444462" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-28T15:41:22+00:00" title="March 28, 2015  3:41PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2015 4:12PM by Paul88.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stefoid that works great for arguments which get under your skin making your blood boil or other emotional response.

There might be modifiers applied for various things, including psychological mods like "this reminds me of a lifeshaping event from my character's past".  Here's a brief example...<br/><br/>In a job negotiation with X Industries, Chaz has two main points on his agenda: (1) He wants the client to provide the ship, and (2) he needs at least 10M to cover Marty's salary and pay down some debt.  His counter-negotiator is Maxina Rholfe, a disciplined contract specialist.<br/><br/>Frame 1: Chaz will be saying that, given the particulars of the mission, it\u2019s only fair and customary that the vessel be provided by the client.  Maxina will point out that Chaz has not been very fortunate with clients\u2019 ships in the past.  The GM rules that no mods apply here.  The dice are rolled.  The results are:<br/>Chaz (CHARM 2d6) = 5<br/>Maxina (CHARM 2d6, Rhetoric +2) =  5<br/><br/>Resolution: \u201c<b>YES BUT</b>\u201d.  Chaz gets Maxina to agree on providing a ship, BUT he must agree to pay for any damages that may be incurred.  \u201cNo problem\u201d, he thinks.<br/><br/>Frame 2: Maxina has lost ground due to her defeat in the first Frame.  A modifier of -1 will be applied to her roll this Frame. Chaz decides to tell her that there are some important expenses he\u2019ll have to cover in preparing for the mission, and that he can accept no less than 10M.  Maxina is imagining more like 6M.  The dice are rolled. The results are:<br/>Chaz = (CHARM 2d6) = 2<br/>Maxina = (CHARM 2d6, Rhetoric +2, Dialog -1) = 4<br/><br/>Resolution: \u201c<b>NO AND</b>\u201d.  Chaz has lost this Frame, and badly.  Maxina stares him down.

Its called Ingenero.<br/><br/>Even if we are just talking 'winning arguments' , I still think ultimately it comes down to emotional manipulation, and establishing the emotions in play leads to more fruitful roleplaying then establishing a win/lose outcome, I think.<br/><br/>In 'contested' social situations, Ingenero isnt concerned with establishing if one character is able to make another character do or say something specifically - its just offers the mechanics for the characters to conceal/uncover facts about the objective situation and cause emotional responses in other characters.  The result of which is information for the _players_ to then decide how their characters behave and resolve the situation accordingly.<br/><br/>Like Rickard says, the characters emotions will colour how you roleplay any situation - and it neednt be blood boiling, it might be the reverse.  Imagine if your character wants something from a character who is angry.  The best way is to make that character feel remorseful or compassionate or whatever.   If the game mechanics resolve just that, - either success or failure in getting the character to feel remorseful, then it doesnt hidner roleplaying to resolve the characters goal - it facilitates it with extra information.  Whereas  mechanics that resolve the goal itself (whether the character gets something from the other character) short circuit roleplaying the outcome in an artifical way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444523/#Comment_444523" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-03T15:49:36+00:00" title="April  3, 2015  3:49PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I think of social "conflicts" in games, it's usually one of these situations:<br/><br/>1. A PC is making some kind of deal with an NPC. This is a negotiation of costs vs. benefits for both sides, usually. For example, "Hey, we want into the castle. Let us in and we'll give you some money and promise not to tell your boss that you were asleep on your watch."<br/><br/>This doesn't have to be sociopathic. Both sides can work to find the best deal for everyone and not try to screw the other guy over.<br/><br/><br/>2. A PC is tricking or fooling an NPC. This is usually a one-sided thing, but it can look like a negotiation (but the NPC who thinks he gains from the trade doesn't actually get that thing). For example, "I'm a noble. Let me into the castle, and you'll have my favor."<br/><br/>This is fairly sociopathic, in the sense I've been using the word. The PC is using the NPC, and might even bring the NPC to harm, probably without much remorse. <br/><br/><br/>3. A PC is trying to sway an NPC to prevent a violent conflict. Here, the NPC holds most of the cards and it's about the PC showing her true colors so the NPC has a change of heart. For example, "Whoa whoa, slow down there, pointy-spear. I'm not here to hurt anyone. I just wanted to sneak into the king's ball so that I could get a message to the princess. I swear I'm not up to no good--well, not the kind of 'no good' you think. Once my message is delivered, I'm out of there. I swear by the god Brom."<br/><br/>This doesn't have to be sociopathic, either, if the PC has truly good motives. This is about clearing up misunderstandings, de-escalating conflict, and other good things. If the PC has terrible motives and is lying about being a good dude, then it's just -pathic con artistry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444525/#Comment_444525" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-03T20:00:25+00:00" title="April  3, 2015  8:00PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a game that cares about sociopathic vs otherwise, maybe you could make a check against Humanity, with failure meaning that your scruples trip you up in your sociopathic attempt.

That's pretty slick, I like that oracular design you have. I'm surprised that you actually found quite a number of Yes, But; yes, and; etc. type statements that go quite well for a lot of different situations.  Let me know how it progresses, I'd love to see the final organism.<br/><br/>Edit: While this may have started in an attempt to help me work through a specific system, I am still very interested in the different types of ways people approach this aspect of playing the game. I think what makes social interactions the hardest part to deal with is because it's something that CAN be done at the table.  Rarely, unless your group is some kind of bloodsport/rpg hybrid group, do people ever act out their various combat scenes. But the social scenes of a game can be acted/talked through.  So, in some ways, it seems odd to drop mechanics on something that can be accomplished without the rules weighing in too much on the scenario.<br/><br/>When I was posting this to begin with, i was trying to make a system that would help people who kind of suck at the whole social aspect of games step up their game. A system that would facilitate their lack of RP skills and make it viable for them to accomplish.  I'm imaging the scenario where a guy who's lacking in social skills (IRL) wants to play a character who's a hustler/silver-tongue.  In a lot of games, the rolls help you accomplish these actions.  But the Rp narrative imposed is pretty poor if the player can't do it themselves.  You just have these silent montage scenes where the music swells up and two people's mouths are moving and they are gesturing wildly or in some other way to convey the emotional context, and then finally one party nods and the camera fades to black as they transition away from that scene.  I wanted a game that helps add dialogue to those moments.  Might be a bit too ambitious though.  If anyone is wondering, I spectacularly failed in that aspect.  Kinda just came up with something to plug the stop-gap cause it was pissing me off.  But I think the stuff we've been discussing throughout this thread can be applied to another project of mine, especially if i start w/ the social mechanics and build everything else around that idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444528/#Comment_444528" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-03T20:58:44+00:00" title="April  3, 2015  8:58PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think some of this comes down to murder-hobo play. Murder hobos are, by definition, murderful and hoboriffic, meaning they kill without remorse and then they go somewhere else. They do not have to face the consequences of their actions. This lends itself to sociopathic play.<br/><br/>In the social domain, murder hobos enjoy a lot of single-interaction encounters. They want to get into the castle. They meet a guard. They con the guard and get into the castle. The guard probably gets in huge trouble with the captain of the watch, maybe even the monarch. If the murder hobos actually lived in that town, then they'd have an angry guard after them, and maybe also an angry captain and an angry monarch. But they're in Cleveland now, so no worries.<br/><br/>I think if you're designing a social system then it has to take reputation into consideration. Shunning and shaming are powerful forces of society, if you live in that society. Don't bother designing a social system for murder hobos, because they live outside of society. <br/><br/>At the same time, no self-respecting guard would act like a bunch of murder hobo PCs are anything but wandering troublemakers; there's no deal to be made there, and maybe no con to fall for. The guard knows everyone in town and might even know most of the foreign visitors. The guard knows the social norms for foreign visitors better than the PCs, too. "Oh, you're from Cleveland? Do you know Bob from Cleveland then? No. Better prove you're actually from Cleveland. They usually have royal papers. Do you have royal papers? No, those aren't royal papers; they're obviously a forgery."<br/><br/>But say the pull a fast one on the guard. Eventually, they come back to that castle. "Hey, aren't you guys the assholes who got Bob tossed into the dungeon for a week? And I don't mean shackled to a wall; the dungeon here is a maze with monsters in it, and there's only the one way in and out. Bob survived, I'm sure you'll be overjoyed to hear, but he's got a wicked case of PTSD and mostly hides under his bed at home now. So no, you're not getting into the castle, and you can be sure I'll let the captain know you're in town. We call him Captain Charon, on account of him escorting so many across the river to the land of the dead..."<br/><br/>Reputation matters in real society. The worst thing that can happen to a person in normal society is shunning. Worse than death, maybe. Shunned people live alone with no friends. Dead people don't have to be lonely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444531/#Comment_444531" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-04T01:03:15+00:00" title="April  4, 2015  1:03AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2015 1:05AM by JDCorley.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This actually doesn't require that it be your own conscience trip you up.  Aristotle divided rhetoric into pathos (emotional appeals), logos (logical or reasonable appeals), but said the most powerful and the one most in the command of the persuade-r was ethos (ethical or virtuous appeals).  He was talking about how we tend to trust ethical people - those that demonstrate in their words and actions that we share values. I can't tell you how many times I've heard something like "Yeah, that makes sense, you're absolutely right, but I still won't go along with it." That's ethos beating logos.  They don't trust me (or my client perhaps).  They may even believe or know intellectually or emotionally that I'm right, but they can't go along with it anyway because they suspect we have different ethical priorities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444532/#Comment_444532" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-04T01:50:02+00:00" title="April  4, 2015  1:50AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, JD.

I guess it's not just an <i>easier</i> way to win votes than authoring constructive policy; it's a <i>more effective</i> one too!  To me, this kind of behavior is <i>way</i> more sociopathic than just lying to the guard about why my mission earns me admission -- on top of that, I'd also be (e.g.) finding the guy's weakness in that his tribal identity trumps his logic, lying about my own identity to position myself as a tribal authority, and then lying that doing what <i>I</i> want is really doing what our <i>tribe</i> wants.<br/><br/>As for Adam's point about community, I agree -- all this stuff <i>really</i> gets interesting when embedded in a web of consequence.  I'd love to play a small-world RPG and see some character act like a modern politician but then face actual consequences when the truth circulated about how his actions did not support his stated ethos.

They are obviously not objectively and quantitatively verifiable, but may be worth investigating for stuff to represent in your game.<br/><br/>For example, one model separated "conflict styles" into four quadrants. One included people who prioritize maintaining a positive relationship with their opponent over winning the actual argument. While that sounds like a losing strategy, it may not necessarily be (particularly if it allows them to get more of what they want in the long-term, appeal to sympathy, or use other similar tactics). For instance, you might say, "Hey, why are we arguing? This is all out of hand. Why don't we cool down for a minute and go over here, I'll buy you a drink?" And perhaps later you'll magically find that your opponent is no longer as hard-headed as they were at the beginning, despite nothing about your actual disagreement having changed.<br/><br/>Another consisted of people who approach conflict very directly and head-on: strong emotional tactics, bullying, very direct stuff. A third had to do with people who prefer to appeal to reason and persuasion, and remain relatively distant emotionally. There were also categories for indirect approaches (these have to do with appeals to tribal identity, winning the sympathy of the other party by telling stories demonstrating shared values or background, analogy/metaphor, and so on - politician stuff definitely fits in here, I'd say).<br/><br/>There was also a category of people who would dynamically switch strategies whenever they saw one wasn't working. They weren't tied to any particular approach, only winning. A bit scary, but also very effective!<br/><br/>Some interesting takeaways were that if you didn't try to mirror your opponent's strategy/approach to at least some extent, you were likely to run into trouble. For instance, in a culture where direct confrontation is the way people settle disputes, someone who attempts to placate their opposition and deal with the problem indirectly, instead of facing it head on, might anger their "opponent", who feels that he or she doesn't respect them enough to meet them halfway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444540/#Comment_444540" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-04T06:08:15+00:00" title="April  4, 2015  6:08AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2015 6:08AM by JDCorley.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually I do not consider ethical persuasion at all "sociopathic"...why should logic/reason automatically win out over values? Why privilege the mind or even the heart over the soul?  <br/><br/>Anyway, here's how I do it:<br/><br/>First, you give up your weaknesses before you talk about your strengths. Only someone's ally would do that!<br/><br/>Second, acknowledge points of agreement by saying WHY we are in agreement on them. It is because we value the same things.<br/><br/>Third, openly make clear promises and explain why you're doing them and why you'll follow through no matter what the other party/parties decide.  (Then do - you're able to do this because you're identifying areas where you're in agreement.)<br/><br/>Fourth, acknowledge and preserve the strength in the other side's position and explain why it is worthy.  Or, if you want to propose a different route, do so in a way that preserves both the strength and the value the strength is defending. ("Rather than have a trial, what about if you made a statement to the court; this would mean the court could hear what you're feeling about the situation and draw on your experience in making future decisions." is something I do a lot in my current (extremely invasive and personal) job.)<br/><br/>Cultural aspects definitely play a role, but sometimes it can be helpful to be the guy who will break the rules.  "Finally someone who will give it to me straight, even if he is a vulgar jerk", or "Of course this guy will go the extra mile for me - he clearly doesn't have any boundaries at all!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444542/#Comment_444542" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-04T06:43:28+00:00" title="April  4, 2015  6:43AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not saying ethical persuasion is worse than logical persuasion, just saying that ethical deceit is often worse than logical deceit.

Most of them are either victims or perpetrators of domestic violence, often both at different times.  They've all just experienced the biggest trauma of their lives - the state taking their children away from them.  So..."unreasonable"...I don't know. Yeah, probably. It feels weird saying that because they respond to their situations with the tools in their toolbox: denial, making things up, deflection, victim-blaming, more violence, resentment, hate.  The same way they've gotten through their lives so far.  They do have lawyers to deal with me though, and they're reasonable (though they do the bidding of the client so their freedom is limited.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20109/what-are-the-components-of-social-combat" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20109/what-are-the-components-of-social-combat" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20109/what-are-the-components-of-social-combat/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20109%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20109%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
