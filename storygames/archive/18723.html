(At least I think I remember that correctly.)<br/><br/>Keeping that in mind, I wonder if the theory I wrote about in my previous post is not really valid. Maybe the problem is not that you needd to do roleplaying in order to understand it (after all, who <b>doesn't</b> roleplay at somepoint in their life?). Maybe the comes from D&amp;D 4th Ed. apparently being about telling adventure stories together, while actually being a tactical war game with its focus on combat. The roleplaying aspect is there as something you can do if you already know how to do it, or if you can just draw on previous experiences from childhood, but the game's mechanics don't support it so much in themselves. That might be what confused the person in this example. <br/><br/>Maybe if she'd happened upon another game first, her experience would have been very different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420185/#Comment_420185" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-16T01:14:46+00:00" title="August 16, 2013  1:14AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I picked up the 3.0 D&amp;D Player's Handbook when I was a teenager, knowing nothing about roleplaying games but just having an intuition that this was something that I would love. After reading it through, I still didn't know what roleplaying was. But I felt more strongly than ever that roleplaying and me were meant to be, if only I could figure it out. So, since I didn't know anyone who roleplayed, I bought the Dungeon Master's Guide and the Monster Manual. <br/><br/>It was two thirds of the way through the DMG that I suddenly discovered a transcript of an imaginary session - an example of a dungeon adventure. Suddenly, it made sense - it was a game you played through talking about the shared situation the characters were in, with each player taking one character, and the DM looking after the rest. No where up until then had this been explained. I'd had this vague idea that it was like a super complicated board game, but I'd known that couldn't be right because it also emphasized complete creative freedom. Now that I understood, I had to go back and reread everything again, and it all made much more sense once I knew the fundamental thing they were driving at.<br/><br/>True story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TallPaul" title="TallPaul"><img alt="TallPaul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/761/nEEFJAV72ZSZR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TallPaul">TallPaul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420186/#Comment_420186" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-16T02:52:31+00:00" title="August 16, 2013  2:52AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2013 2:52AM by TallPaul.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>This can be a good approach if the person feels shy: if they're surrounded by their friends (who are also new to the thing), they don't have to worry about "not knowing the ropes".

It was a good starter.<br/><br/>Sadly however, the RPG industry is obsessed with these big hardback books because that's how to maximise your profits from the existing fan base. An awful lot of Kickstarters for example are about getting existing fans to buy a $200 leatherbound hardback of something they already own. The sort of box sets that I grew up with in the 80s thanks to Games Workshop (before it went Warhammer mad) just don't get the sort of attention they once did.<br/><br/>I don't know what the answer is because those big companies have staff to keep in jobs and a willing audience. But the indie crowd has no such existing market and has every reason to grow their own audience (although I've read too many indie rule books with the words "experienced gamers only" in them as well - at least they're honest I suppose).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420198/#Comment_420198" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-16T09:06:48+00:00" title="August 16, 2013  9:06AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps I'm an an extreme minority, but I actually did learn how to run and play D&amp;D from how to play chapters. I'd been running games for years before I ever got a chance to play in someone else's. In my experience, reading a few RPG main books and using a bit of empathy and understanding of social dynamics are a more reliable way to start running games, than trying to discern which habits of a mentor are good or bad, or for that matter easy or difficult to acquire. <br/><br/>I've wondered how much abusive and juvenile behavior in RPGs comes from people doing what they saw others do, and then retroactively justifying it in the play advice. Sure some of it comes from simply immature social dynamics, but it seems possible that these sections often fall under the "do what I say, not what I do" - and this become apparent when you compare folks playing to the idealized descriptions often occurring in books.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420199/#Comment_420199" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-16T09:39:30+00:00" title="August 16, 2013  9:39AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again, it's the Techniques! It's like glasses: you can't see a thing without them and once you wear them for the first time it's like a new world ahead of you... but then you get so used to them you forget you're wearing them. The same has happened to you, me, and way too many game designers out there. <br/><br/>You see, it's true, we have <i>roleplayed</i> at some point in our lives, that's easy and intuitive. But Techniques are a missing key piece that isn't intuitive at first, but becomes a second nature once you see them in action. That's why everything becomes clear ONLY when you read an actual play or see people play. You're probably still using the same ritual expressions to convey each step of the process, just think about it:<br/><br/>-"You are in the town of X doing Y when suddenly..." and then you learned about scene framing and how this is a cue for everyone to pay attention.<br/>-"What do you do?" ...and then you learned that this was the cue for when the GM had finished framing the scene and it was time for your input.<br/>-"I try to convince him of N, do I roll Diplomacy?" and that taught you about how to give your input as an intention and not as a fact, that in this kind of situations you might be asked to roll the dice and how you could back up your roll with skills to have a higher chance of success.<br/><br/>And so on. These ritual phrases aren't roleplaying, but they are so ingrained with it we often confuse both, think Techniques are also intuitive and end up writing books that doesn't explain them, except for the actual play examples, which could actually be better at this or at least could be given a lot more of importance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420203/#Comment_420203" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-16T10:00:51+00:00" title="August 16, 2013 10:00AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't know what the answer is because those big companies have staff to keep in jobs and a willing audience.

The term "game" has an implication that there are strict rules to follow, turn orders, win conditions, whatever. And if you buy a massive Player's Handbook for D&amp;D to "learn" the game without any handholding, forget it; it's a hundred pages of magic spell tables and reference guides. If you have no knowledge of what an RPG is, you come in thinking it's a big complicated boardgame, and then the PH is just a large excel spreadsheet.<br/><br/>Heck, I haven't played D&amp;D for 20 years or so, but my wife wanted to pick a Monster Manual just because she thought it would be a cool reference guide for all of the fantasy novels she was reading at the time. And looking over that tome, with the countless stats and terms...it just made my head hurt. It's complete data overload.<br/><br/>Really, the best way to learn to play an RPG like D&amp;D is to sit down with someone who has played  before...and be told "the only rule is, tell the GM what you want to do, he'll tell you what to do next." Or, watch people playing (and watching a TV show playing doesn't really count).

There's something very different between a man saying "I would totally go, but I don't understand it and I might slow people down" to a woman saying it.<br/><br/>There are some fairly classic things going on. She feels she doesn't understand, she feels she might slow people down. I'm not saying Gender Is The Reason Behind All Of This, but I'm saying it a factor we can't ignore.<br/><br/>And gender is important in this thread. It's a very man thing to say: let's reduce this whole situation down to rational rules and techniques! (WarriorMonk's post, above, is a classic. And I am very happy to explain the link between rationality and masculinity off-line. It is fairly convincing.)<br/><br/>Anyway, I won't go on about this. There is something highly strange about gender conversations that just involve men.

I'm thankful you realize how complex is prodding the Gender landmine in this or any issue and why it deserves a thread of it's own. <br/><br/>You see, that's why I was asking you not to take the thread there; it's not that I'm denying there' s a bazillion of problems there too, it's just that I had a point I feel it's important to solve the subject stated in the very first post: How to explain the game to anyone, regardless of gender issues.<br/><br/>And I won't get tired of saying it again until someone takes it seriously: Techniques.

"I read the manual, but, I mean, I'm not a D&amp;D nerd or anything, so I couldn't possibly start playing." "Wow, you guys all seem to really know what's going on! If I jumped in, I would just slow you down with my questions." "I'm not a 'geek', so I'll never totally understand this crunchy system." <br/><br/>Gaming in particular, I think, can make people feel like impostors because we have a strongly embedded idea of what makes a typical gamer.

They still lack how to get the group to form a creative environment, where people cheer and build on each other's ideas. They still take things for granted.

I'm basing this statement on my first game that was heavily based on techniques. This is why I'm not talking about game mechanics and techniques anymore but instead about <i>structures</i>. By explaining the game in structures, which includes both game mechanics and techniques but also a lot more, you can more easily explain how to play the game, rather than explaining how the game works (which is common when explaining game mechanics).<br/><br/>GAME MECHANICS<br/>1. Roll initiative.<br/>2. Roll attack.<br/>3. Roll damage.<br/><br/>TECHNIQUES<br/>Typical for this genre is to attack someone by spinning, jumping or running.<br/><br/>STRUCTURES<br/>Roll attack roll and, if it's a success, include one of the following in the description of the attack.<br/>- Spinning.<br/>- Jumping.<br/>- Running.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420245/#Comment_420245" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-17T09:11:38+00:00" title="August 17, 2013  9:11AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Nanogames seem better at this when they focus on an specific procedure to start playing.

When you only allow yourself, say, 500-800 words to give a full game, you realize how much stuff you need to concretely put down, so you get rid of everything that (in a longer game) would obfuscate the point.<br/><br/>One thing I've noticed in particular about nanogames is an authoritative voice, because it's necessary.

AW's Principles may be confused with Techniques too, but actually they are more like guidelines which make you remember or develop Techniques to handle the negotiation of the fiction.<br/><br/>Also, most people can either infere/learn this Techniques by reading APs, watch other people use them in play and the hard way, by trial and error while playing.

Game designers are to focused on writing a <i>game</i> which is more instructions on how the game works. It's my belief that we need to start to rethink how to write roleplaying games. They can be shorter (below 20 pages), more to the point (more obvious in why to use the structures) and actually instruct people how to communicate within the group to make it a better session.\n<blockquote>I defy you to find a book on baseball that could teach people how to assemble teams and play the game.</blockquote>\nI don't know anything about baseball, but I'm a soccer coach and there are tons of books that talks about how you should hold your body while making a pass, how to set up a team, how to train on bypassing a defending player, and things like that.

I'm playing <b>InSpectres </b>with non-gamers and it takes them ten minutes to figure out the game. I'm going through the setting in short terms (McDonalds, Big Brother, Ghostbusters - some time in the future), what they are supposed to do (playing employers at a Ghostbusters firm), and how we should play the game (by <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/392340#Comment_392340" rel="nofollow" target="_new">doing an exercise in how to communicate to storytell</a>). I'm making them create the soft mechanics of the character (name, previous profession), and sadly also letting them divide dice in attributes and in their company. Then we start playing, taking off where the exercise ended. The first thing I do is to guide them through the first three phases that InSpectres got, on the way  explaining how to roll and read the dice. In the last phase, the field work, I introduce stress roll and cool. Up to the last phase, the time it takes to go through this, excluding the time it takes to make characters, is around 10-15 minutes. An InSpectres session for me takes around 45 minutes but we usually play it twice, so I can use the second session to introduce the confession chair and how to create traits for each other, how to regain lost dice in attributes, and the economy of the company.<br/><br/>My own <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/400300#Comment_400300" rel="nofollow" target="_new">This Is Pulp</a> is even faster, and instead of having a rulebook of 70+ pages, like for InSpectres, the rulebook is 2,5 pages long. I even had gamers taking over the GM seat after just one seventy minute session. That's how easy it is to learn the game. In how to communicate this through written words, however, is a challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420304/#Comment_420304" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-18T08:14:29+00:00" title="August 18, 2013  8:14AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly Rickard, I didn't think it couldn't be done, but actually, that it should be done more. On top of that, discovering the setting in play and learning new mechanics every once in a while adds a lot to the fun, so you could actually have a very complex set of rules, procedures and mechanics but not release them to the players until later in the campaign, providing you've got a good excuse for that.<br/><br/>Some years ago I GMed a game about teenage sorcerers discovering their powers and the worlds of magic beyond the realm of men (it was more based on Books of Magic comics than in Harry Potter) which used a single d10 for everything.

In other words, prep and play should be explained at the same time.

Say it's about a treasure hunt.<br/><br/>First, everyone picks a character. The intro is read aloud and the first scene is set (by the text). The instructions say "Act out the scene where you meet at the tavern and agree to go on a treasure hunt. Act your character and when you all agree to go, the scene is over."<br/><br/>Maybe the second scene is preparing for the voyage. The instructions say "Make up a thing your character does to prepare for the voyage and describe it. Saying goodbye to your lover, loading the sip, that sort of thing. Take turns."<br/><br/>Third scene might be facing a disaster, and now someone gets to make up the disaster and everyone has to say what they do, and in the end we roll a die to see how it goes, with set alternatives (if you roll a 1-3, your ship is detroyed and you are shipwrecked). Later conflicts will have the players make up the alternatives themselves (a higher roll is better for the characters). By the end of the game, people have been introduced to some light rules and have also been gradually introduced to making stuff up. The final scene is finding the treasure, at which point anything goes. Likely, you'll fight over the treasure (conflicts between characters having been introduced earlier) and freely set scenes of trying to backstab each other and getting away with the treasure.<br/><br/>Something like that. If you want to do a gradual approach, don't just introduce the rules gradually, introduce the concept of roleplaying by starting with simple instructions that go "Ok, stop here, now do this. When you've done this, read on."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark" title="lizziestark"><img alt="lizziestark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">lizziestark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420354/#Comment_420354" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-19T10:24:03+00:00" title="August 19, 2013 10:24AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a woman.

I suspect it has something to do with being cultured to attend to the details of social interactions and not wanting to feel like a social roadblock.<br/><br/>I wanted to watch rather than play because I was nervous about coming into a social situation I had no context for. I think that's a very human emotion and one that men probably feel too.

Also, having a procedure to create adventures considering player input is great, since it helps a lot to get players in the same page quickly, they get more related to the setting because of the creative investment they are making and whatever challenge you can make out of it. However, to really make that work you still need to take time, consider all that player input and write a few surprising/amazing/provocative scenes out of it, to have the players reactions and later actions built the story.\n<blockquote><br/>I actually think settings are written in the wrong way.

We GMs need to plan sessions, story arcs or campaigns, not the story of a whole world. If you're a designer and you've got this strange and incredible world of yours, just tell us the general concept, communicate to GMs and players  the feeling you've got of the diferente setting locations and characters, give us a list of the things and situations we can find on your world and a process to build the starting point and main turning points for a session, an story arch and a campaign. \n<blockquote><br/>The method used for creating an adventure <i>should be first in the book</i> together with structures that tells the reader how to play the game.

Otherwise, you wont understand why you're doing the prep, and you can't understand how to play if you don't know the prep.</blockquote>\nAgreed, you can always introduce the game through a module, ready for players to use right out of the box, but then it'd be perfect for readers to find the procedure to create more adventures. It would be for the best to present all this stuff in the appropiate way for players and GMs to process it in the order it's needed, instead of expecting GMs and players to read the whole book or worse, having the GM study it until they learn it by heart, to later explain everything to the players besides of finding their own way for building adventures. Specially when that task also has to deal with a complicate mechanics and thousands of modifiers / special rules for everything.<br/><br/>I think I'd still start the book with a short comic showing an AP that specifies the techniques, and as a parallel, show what's going on in the fiction to convey what the fiction proposed by the designer should look/feel like.<br/><br/>Right after that there would be the procedure to create characters with the most basic options, interwined with the start of the adventure, handing a pre-made module for the GM. Then would come the procedure for prepping more GM material, followed by the full library of locations, NPCs ideas, monsters, items, mc guffins, weapons, equipment, etc. Another section after that would feature the whole procedure for creating characters of all levels of complexity needed for the game along with ideas of how to relate them to the adventure and other PCs/NPCs.<br/><br/>BW had the right idea, but it's still too complex for my taste :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420363/#Comment_420363" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-19T13:56:26+00:00" title="August 19, 2013  1:56PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To the original post. <br/><br/>I would imagine that your person was experiencing a natural level of shyness.

I can think of five uncomfortable situations I've had in the last ten years in gaming that technique could not fix (one of them gender, others power-related, others related to illness), and could think of ten more if given a minute.<br/><br/>I know where you're coming from, but unless the original poster Brian confirms there were no gender issues in play (how is another discussion, to be sure, but at least he was there) and says he doesn't want to talk about that in this thread, gender is on the table. <br/><br/>At the very least, keep your mind open to techniques that can be used to create a positive environment across gender lines.<br/><br/>Long story short: <b>Gender's in play. Stop dismissing it as an angle, or shutting down the discussion.</b><br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420438/#Comment_420438" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T13:55:47+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  1:55PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So I guess gender is irrelevant after all, huh.

To me, there's not a lot of gender subtext <b>there</b>, aside from the bigger gender issues around gaming.<br/><br/>In the course of our conversation, I mentioned a local gaming event (which, as it happens, is pretty woman-friendly, as far as I'm aware). She expressed some hesitation about <b>that</b>, which certainly has a gender component. (But maybe not so straightforwardly as some in the thread feel. This is someone with no knowledge of what gaming events are like, so maybe now we're just talking about how women are socialized generally, which is a lot to take on.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420445/#Comment_420445" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T14:31:10+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  2:31PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As further development, I'm going to run a game for her and some friends so she can see what this D&amp;D business is all about.

Yet everybody here wants to go there, so I'll address the gender issue with some experience of my own.<br/><br/>I was kinda in the same situation here: I told a friend of mine about roleplaying games, she became interested and wanted to know how to play them. She took a glance at some of my books, loved the art and laugh at the anecdotes of our sessions, but up until that part she still didn't know how to play it and hadn't meet the rest of my group. So she explicitly (though half joking) said that probably my friends would hate her for stalling the game, that it felt a bit complicated and a couple other excuses alike.<br/><br/>I've gotta add all the things she didn't said but were clearly readable in her attitude: she's quite a people person, she's a therapist so she knows a lot about dealing with all kind of people. Of course, that doesn't make her completely extrovert, but my point is that perhaps it wasn't completely about shyness that she felt intimidated.<br/><br/>There was also the fact that she found our anecdotes fun and unexpected, like something out of a novel, and thought you had to be incredibly creative and very good at impro to play the game. Not a surprise there, I'm a veteran player and I think that myself about games like Fiasco and other indie storygames.<br/><br/>My guess was that is was the combination of all these all among other things, which generates a complicated emotional situation. Try to put in her shoes: you've got to get along with people you don't know, all not only from the opposite sex but who may misinterpretate your curiosity as personal interest. Then the whole activity is about a complex game for which you will have to make a ton of questions, which could also get misinterpretated as personal interest, and mainly will probably halt the game may times and make the experience frustrating for everybody. You don't want these strangers hate you nor fall for you or think bad of you, so you're trying to be polite only to find later that you're sharing a table with barbarians. But you are curious about this game, want to play it eventually and you're sure all you need is some reassurance.<br/><br/>So, it's like a blind date with a game, get it now?<br/><br/>Ok, here's what I did:<br/><br/>-She told me that she wanted to watch. I know from first hand that watching a session without playing can be boring and off-putting sometimes, and on top of that you might still end up not understanding what you see (the fisrt time I saw a group playing D&amp;D I didn't, though some things started to become clearer). So I told her that. But then I didn't force her to play one game, I gave her options.<br/><br/>-I had two or three simpler games that work both as a ice-breaker and help people relax a bit while learning some of the techniques for roleplaying, I offered that and also a list of boardgames we have. So it wasn't like "our way or the highway" but more like "you've got nothing to lose, all choices are fun"<br/><br/>-I reassured her about my group; while they get into barbarian mode from time to time, they know how to behave in front of a lady, and I'm often ready to make them behave in case they dare go back into barbarian mode. I made this clear in a humorous way, which seemed to work (she visibly relaxed).<br/><br/>-Finally she came to our session and though we started with Aye, Dark Overlord! (which is hilarious but a bit rough and stressful since you might end up bullied) she relaxed a lot and then we went into roleplaying.<br/><br/>-I used my Adapt game, which is a sort of light-hearted version of Paranoia XP with lots of randomness. It worked like a charm and she realized the game didn't had to be serious, it's a game after all. She saw us use the basic techniques and soon she was figuring out new ones by her own and finding us ready to roll with her input and build upon it.<br/><br/>-Later we improvised a dungeon with some D&amp;D cardboard tiles and my Resourcefull deck (which now I'm more proud of, it helped me to improvise a nice story and characters on the run, and then it helped me to populate the dungeon with traps, puzzles and monsters as the players went further into it) and we saw her gaining confidence on each scene, to finally turn for a moment into the avatar of a dark godess. She even roleplayed the part nicely; the party managed to rescue her and then they all escaped just in time as the whole dungeon collapsed.<br/><br/>Now, you can see that yes, there was a gender issue there, but again, I'd go the same way if the new player was a male with the difference that I'd had to adjust my sensibility to not hurt his pride.<br/><br/>Ok that was my take on the gender issue. And still, I don't feel is related to the fact that learning a game from the book is quite difficult. Why? because while the D&amp;D art has a high male-centric content, it was still appealing to my friend; and besides that, there's nothing in the book that makes it harder to learn the game for any specific gender (I'm not sure if somebody meant that when they referred to the gender issue; I hope not but at certain points I had that impression, hence my insistence not to go there since I find that really insulting).<br/><br/>So I beg you pardon but IMHO the problem about a reader unable to understand the game from the book, is in the book. It's in the way it explains the rules and leaves other important things for veteran players to explain to the new ones. <br/><br/>For the rest of the problems, yes, I agree that when teaching and bringing new players to the hobby, veteran players still make too many mistakes out of passion for the game. I feel embarrased that there's still so much bigotry among fellow players, designers and publishers. I feel terrible about the gender issues and It's certainly something we have to address now, something that can't be denied or minimized. If somebody thought I meant any of this you're totally wrong. I blame my poor writing skills in english which as some of you know, isn't my native language. Feel free to correct my own methods for dealing with the problem; it worked in this case but I'm sure it won't for others, so the more I learn about treating other people the more grateful I'll be.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420460/#Comment_420460" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T19:49:50+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  7:49PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2013 8:07PM by Brian_Minter.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Uh, oh, Brian, I don't get if you're dismissing the gender part or not, I'm taking like it's still on the table though you as me don't see that as the main issue in discussion. </blockquote>\nThis thread was way more involved than I guessed when I posted, so I definitely don't feel like it's my place to shut down any discussion.

Either way, somebody's gonna end up playing with the box in which it came.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420562/#Comment_420562" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-22T09:53:51+00:00" title="August 22, 2013  9:53AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420603/#Comment_420603" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-23T03:36:17+00:00" title="August 23, 2013  3:36AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure someone could entertain themselves gluing chess pieces together into interesting scultures.

No, I don't either. That's the genius of the trick - to take advantage of peoples inclination to think that only if a right way is shown, is their way disproven. How do you <i>hijack </i>such a notion? <i>Never provide a full procedural break down of the right way to play to begin with!</i> Over and over again people will (if they don't just say 'I have no idea how to play' as with the adorable OP example) invent entertainment at the table, and because of their notion they must see a right way or else what they are doing is not disproven in regards to how to do it, they keep finding what they do as the very way to play D&amp;D (or any other number of RPGs). No matter how incompatable their play is with another group (see the <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17334.msg188019#msg188019" rel="nofollow">constructive denial</a> thread). Also the hard look at D&amp;D article gropes at this as well "<i>How did you know it worked? What did you do it for?

I went through the same thing back in the late '80s: I knew that roleplaying games sounded totally awesome and I wanted to get in on that action. So I started buying RPGs. I went through the Batman RPG, MERP, and Bunnies &amp; Burrows. I bought them, I read them, I occasionally created a character... I had absolutely no idea how to play them. It's actually kind of amazing how bad the majority of RPGs and STGs are at making themselves accessible to new players. (Like a lot of other people, it was finally the Mentzer D&amp;D Basic Set that finally let me figure things out.)<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18723/i-just-literally-do-not-know-how-to-play" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18723/i-just-literally-do-not-know-how-to-play" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18723/i-just-literally-do-not-know-how-to-play/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18723%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18723%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
