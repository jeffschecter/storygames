                            I'm not sure I can speak to the story game issue, but this chapter certainly feels relevant for writing role playing games.  : )<br/><br/>This chapter changed how I look at stories. Or pointed something out: if you take characters/situations and find ways they can be inter-related then resolve some aspect of their interaction, you've got a complete story. It reminds me of AG&amp;G, really. <br/><br/>Another thing is that a routine is analogous to Vincent's <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=66" rel="nofollow">static situation</a>. The disruption of the routine makes it dynamic. It was interesting though that what made it routine was being predictable.  I usually think in terms of adversity to make things dynamic, but simply changing things up can have the same effect. So an embellishment would work as well as a complication.                        </div>

                            of the games ( and I realise that there is a more important lesson) I think that the character game is already being used pretty well(as in master creation in MLWM), and the dream game is sort of a modified Pull ( a pushmepullyou), experts seems like the closest thing to what we already do. Automatic writing would be cool as a starter, as would a verbal chase. They could get the juices flowing and get everyones minds limber.<br/><br/>Emily - I was also thinking of AG&amp;G while I reread this ( haven't played yet) you are certainly playing spontaneously and taking on characters at random then pushing them into whatever situation is most interesting for you. when I read AG&amp;G the first time I was associating it with the Cheap &amp; Cheesy name so I didn't think much about how the game does all of this stuff. Does the game reward reincorporation on any level? I think the "we owe list" is sort of a reincorporater but is there any mechanic that rewards a character for brining back an item or a location from a previous session?<br/><br/>I would lastly like to look more closely at the last bit about what Johnstone calls "content". I think we have grown to call it premise and I think that he is right that we play better toward it when we let thinkng about it go.                        </div>

                            For me, the two really useful points to take away from this chapter are:<br/>
<br/>
1. Reincorporation is really satisfying. For example, if the players find a crystal scroll at the start of the game, it's really satisfying if that scroll solves the problem at the end of the game. It doesn't matter whether it makes sense or not (well, not much).<br/>
<br/>
2. Quiet bits (platforms) are really useful in a story. There's a temptation to make stories big and full of conflict (Bam! Conflict. Bam! Another conflict. etc etc). But the quiet bits, where nothing much seems to happen but you establish lots of colour, are important too.<br/>

                            OK, cool.  I'm back.  <br/><br/>Take a routine and disrupt it.  Instant story. That's obvious but also pure gold.  This is something I really want to explore more.<br/><br/>I'm not too familiar with freeform, but to what extent is the "guided story" a technique used in that approach to roleplaying?  And how does that relate to Pull?<br/><br/>AG&amp;G doesn't do much mechanically to reward reincorporation (you do get extra specialties, so there's a little), but remember Johnstone describing the audience applauding with delight when stuff comes back around?  That is <em>totally</em> there.                        </div>

<blockquote>what are the games which build routines well? what games reward the breaking of routines?</blockquote>
Oh, great question.<br/><br/>Dogs In The Vineyard does a bit of this. The Dogs come into town (routine), they talk to the townsfolk (routine) but then <i>something's wrong</i> (break). (I'm aware that I give Dogs In The Vineyard as an example for everything).<br/><br/>My Life With Master, too, sort of. You establish a routine of:<br/><br/>1. Master orders<br/>2. Minion carries out orders<br/><br/>but the story <i>really</i> starts the first time that routine breaks.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

Something like this, perhaps?<br/><br/><i>Player: So we go into the tavern.<br/>GM: Suddenly someone shouts "Get them!" and everyone leaps at you.<br/>Player: Fine. I draw my sword.<br/>GM: Your sword says "I grant you three wishes!"<br/>Player: All right. First I wish for great wealth.<br/>GM: You get two copper coins.<br/>Player: I pick up the coins...<br/>GM: They're red hot! They burn your hand!<br/>Player: All right, I cast Cure Light Wounds on my hand<br/>GM: And suddenly your God bellows down from heaven "Stop using that spell!"</i><br/><br/>...and so on. Any one of those breaks in the routine is fine, but one after the other, it just becomes a jumble.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            You're right, Graham. The quiet moments are necessary to allow the twists and turns to become integrated. <br/>
<br/>
I am reminded of The Rock and other Bruckheimer movies that KEEP THE ADRENALINE PUMPING. After 10 minutes of it, it's hard to care what is happening since the tension is so high all the time. It's a dynamic tempo that keep one's attention.                        </div>

<blockquote>A kicker is the definition of a broken routine. (well, figuratively)</blockquote>
Oh, that's good. Yes, kickers and bangs are both pretty much broken routines. I like it when you can relate areas of theory to each other.<br/><br/>You know how, at the start of <a href="http://www.septemberquestion.org/lumpley/tnaplay.html" rel="nofollow">The Nighttime Animals Save The World</a>, you have to choose a bad feeling and name the animal that made you feel it (e.g. "I'm scared because Basil the Cat chased me up a tree")? And then, later on, the GM is encouraged to have the bad animal show up and not back down?<br/><br/>To me, that's great reincorporation. At the beginning, you say "There's this bad animal"; so throughout the story, you expect him to appear; and then you bring him back into the story and it's very satisfying.<br/><br/>Oh, that leads us on to Promises. Has the concept of Promises been mentioned yet?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I don't remember reading about Promises, but I don't have the book with me to check. What are they? <br/>
<br/>
I don't know if this relates, but re-incorporation has got me thinking about foreshadowing.  The reason foreshadowing is so satisfying is because it creates a "loop" of reincorp that gives things a bigger kick when they happen. <br/>
<br/>
Also, in order to bring about that surprise moment of the routine being broken, a misdirect can be spectacularly helpful. I've been watching a lot of Buffy the Vampire Slayer lately and they use that technique to great effect.  I'm mulling over how that can be used in rpg.  It is different since you are the audience...                        </div>

                            So I finally ran MLWM last night and I purposely let them do a lot of semi irrelevant stuff so that they would push out things which they were interested in. Next week I am going to try to incorporate as many of the little things as I can back in. <br/><br/>I just started masks and I haven't encountered Promices yet.<br/><br/>Is a kicker a broken routine if there was no routine set befor the game? I see that they are something that breaks the routine if they come in durring the game,  but what about at the start?                        </div>

                            I think a kicker is a good example.  The routine is implied in the backstory:  "I was just a photocopy repairman until I came home to find my house occupied by gorgons."                        </div>

                            Character creation is a sort of routine creation. And setting, too. Rpg in general is one big re-incorporation machine: you get rewarded for using the story stuff on your character sheet etc again and again. <br/><br/><i>I'm not too familiar with freeform, but to what extent is the "guided story" a technique used in that approach to roleplaying? And how does that relate to Pull?</i><br/><br/>It sounds a lot like using pull to me. Though I've used this particular format a lot more in ritual space than rpg. The process of collaborative development and brainstorming that happens a lot in free-form I've been involved in (table top, co-gm'd etc) has a lot of similar elements. One person may think of something and ask someone else to give details.                        </div>

<blockquote>Rpg in general is one big re-incorporation machine: you get rewarded for using the story stuff on your character sheet etc again and again</blockquote>
Oh, yes, good point, especially about the fact that you get <i>rewarded</i> for reincorporating. That's very true. Hadn't thought of that.
<blockquote>I don't know if this relates, but re-incorporation has got me thinking about foreshadowing. The reason foreshadowing is so satisfying is because it creates a "loop" of reincorp that gives things a bigger kick when they happen.</blockquote>
That's very true. Interesting.<br/><br/>In a way, foreshadowing is a special case of reincorporation. With foreshadowing, you're setting up something you know will be reincorporated later ("You see a black rook overhead, which you recognise as an omen the King will die.").<br/><br/>I think reincorporation is slightly wider. It gives you the power to set up something unspecific ("You see a black rook overhead, which you recognise as an omen.") and then reincorporate it later in a satisfying way ("As the King dies, the rook comes to perch by him, as if his death was fated."). Even though when you introduced the rook, you didn't know quite how you'd reincorporate it.<br/><br/>(Have I understood foreshadowing right, here?)<br/><br/>Jason, I tell you, I've been looking forward to that Masks and Trance conversation since we started these threads. If there's ever a chapter for making people go "What the <i>hell</i> is this about?", it's that one.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            In the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/risus-companion.htm" rel="nofollow">Risus Companion,</a> breaking routines is used as a scenario design technique. You split up a routine into several sub-routines, and then break every single one of them.I don't remember the exact example, but the principle goes something like this:<br/>
<br/>
Routine:<br/>
Order pizza<br/>
<br/>
Sub-routines:<br/>
Go to phone. BUT on the way to the phone, you're attacked by vampire buffalo.<br/>
Call pizza parlor. BUT there's a mess-up, and your call is transferred to the local Mafia branch instead.<br/>
Speak to pizza parlor people and order pizza. BUT they try to sell you their Daily Special, which requires you to answer a quiz and take a quick time travel trip.<br/>
Wait for pizza . BUT while you wait, there's shooting in the neighboring flat, and you have to find out who did it.<br/>
Pay for pizza. BUT you don't have any money, and the pizza guy tries to take your computer as payment instead.<br/>
Eat pizza. BUT it starts talking to you.                        </div>
