                    I've been searching for RPGs that deal with time in a way that affects the game mechanics.  Not necessarily what happened an hour or even a week ago.  But changing game dynamics based on the past, present or future.  This could be flashbacks, flashforwards, and the like that involve the same characters.  Which would preclude the interesting "ongoing" sense of time in a game like Hero's Banner since it switches to new characters.<br/><br/>Have you seen any games that do what I am describing?                </div>

                            Aaaaaaah!<br/><br/>Hating to pimp my own still-in-development work, but Grey Ranks does exactly this.  Each scene takes place on a specific day, moving forward in time across a span of two busy, awful months.  The scene number is used to measure adversity, so it ramps up from 1 to 10 across as many scenes, which closely corresponds with the real-world situation reflected by the dates I picked.  <br/><br/>You play out missions taking place on those dates that are player-authored, and missions are interleaved with flashbacks and other personal scenes.                        </div>

<em>Feng Shui</em> (or was it <em>HKAT</em>?) allows you to spend your XP at any time by having a flashback to a training sequence.  It's not exactly what you're looking for, but I've always thought it was clever.                        </div>

                            Jason, I'm glad you did pimp Grey Ranks as I had already downloaded your pdf but hadn't yet dug much into it.  I like some of the following notes you have about Personal Scenes, if you don't mind me quoting:
<blockquote>Personal Scenes should revolve around a clear goal for which success and failure are both options.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Personal Scenes interrupt the narrative flow of a Mission. In contrast to a Mission Scene, a Personal Scene should focus on the interior life and growth of the character.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Personal Scenes can build on previous efforts, Chapter by Chapter.</blockquote>
I was looking at your Personal Scenes in particular because they deal with flashbacks that are more than just color, they can and do affect the present and the future.  I'm still working on mechanics for unveiling one's Dark Past in 'The Naked City' using flashbacks, so I am really digging your use of time here.  I get the feeling that your game is constantly moving...even grinding...forward; with occasional breaks to see what has transpired in the past.<br/><br/>I'm working on characters traits and relationships for my Film Noir game that are actually tied to a place in time.  So while you might have been <i>happy go-lucky</i> in the Past; in the Present you have become <i>embittered</i>.  And it's up to the players to decide how and why that transition took place.<br/><br/>Oops, didn't mean this to become a thread about 'The Naked City'.  You just threw down some good content.<br/><br/>Any more games that I am missing?                        </div>

                            My game "The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries," whose most recent playtest draft is available  <a href="http://ericjboyddesigns.com/Documents/The%20Committee%20v6.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> is premised on the characters recounting an expedition from which they have recently returned. As part of telling tales of their exploits, they can introduce tangents discussing events of prior adventures to receive a mechanical boost in the current story - sort of a flashback within a story of past events. And at the end of the game, you flash forward to the future and see the eventual fates of the characers in the wake of the expedition. Sounds sort of like what you have in mind. <br/><br/>I'm looking forward to seeing more of "The Naked City," by the way.                        </div>

                            "grind" is a good word, because things are inexorable and monolithic and, generally, suck.  One thing that interests me is how personal scenes are used in play, because there is very little guidance and no huge mechanical benefit to success.  Fighting for success is an individual decision to value love over hate, which is strictly optional, believe me.  Failure is much easier but few players seem to go for it.<br/><br/>In Naked City, is there an incentive to resolving that dangling transition from happy-go-lucky to embittered?  It's a cool idea and a built-in opportunity to frame a fun flashback.  Maybe that's enough!                        </div>

There isn't necessarily an incentive to resolving that transition.  It exists to cause the player to play their character a bit differently in scenes that take place in the past vs. those in the present.  But those traits are often a hint to the character's dark past that they are hiding at all costs.                        </div>

                            John Wick's Wilderness of Mirrors (heh, makes it sound like a tourist attraction, maybe in Branson) has a mechanic where you dock the players some resources for every twenty minutes of real, out-of-game time the mission takes. A brute-force way to ratchet up tension, maybe, but certainly effective.                        </div>

                            We occasionally play a game of d20 CoC (yeah) where the team goes back in time for various weird-ass missions. they have a clock with them, a special clock that shows them when it's time to get back to their original location in order to be picked up by the time-portal thingie. The weird thing is, the clock does not move at constant speed, even though it always accurately shows when the return portal appears.<br/><br/>The clock is also an actual physical clock, and the out-of-game mission time is usually 1 hour. The weirdness of in-game time is explained by the typical time zoom factor of rpgs - in fights, we count seconds of game time, then in the next scene we might just say "yeah, we go to the next city", and be there near-instantly in real time.<br/><br/>I do not know if this is our GM's invention or what, but it sure does make for some intensive sessions.                        </div>

                            It seems to me that this thread is about two totally different things. Maybe it's just me, but in my mind "dealing with time" using a physical clock has little to do with characters having flashbacks...<br/>
<br/>
As for the former, we use a timer, a very old mechanical one which "beep" sounds more like a fire alarm. If the characters are short on time and have to do something really fast, I set the alarm for 10 or 20 minutes, and when it goes off, the expected bad stuff happens. For example, last week the characters were on a treasure hunt, and had to search in a place which was possible to enter only at low tide. We never play dungeon crawl, so obviously the players would've liked to be as careful as possible and would've discussed all the little details for hours if it wasn't for the alarm.<br/>
<br/>
As for the latter, I am actually designing a game now which does have some mechanism for dealing with flashbacks (or flashforwards). It's called Great Naruto Storytelling, but I'm afraid I don't have any meaningful reading to offer you just because currently it's all in Russian. However, I'll try to explain right here in a few words, feel free to ask for more info if you need it.<br/>
<br/>
A flashback always has a goal, a trigger and a plot. You can't just say "well, let's stop the game and I'll tell you a funny story about myself". A goal is usually "explain something" or "show something" (in a wide sense). A trigger is an action that initiates the flashback: a question, an attack or anything else that can give you the right to say "oh yes, this reminds me of...". A funny variant is when the Master introduces a new character, and a player says "hey, I know the guy, we went to school together!" or "I once fought him, it was long time ago" (the system allows you to do that) - and then the story of how exactly they met follows. A plot can involve several characters, so you begin with listing what do you need ("in order to tell this, I need a 'wise one-armed teacher' and a 'little sick brother'"). Any player at the table (or on the forum, if you play online) can say "I'll take that", and play that role inside the flashback. Everything about such a character besides the short description is up to the player who took it (e.g., the reason for losing an arm can be child's foolishness or a knightly exploit - if the flashback master didn't mention it, (s)he doesn't mind). Then the flashback is played with all involved players, and the rest just have to sit back and enjoy the show. The main lines of the flashback are determined by its initiator - if the 'little brother' has to die, he dies, no question asked. At the end of the flashback its goal is achieved. If it was to explain why the character had an ugly scar on his face, it's explained; if it was to make a decision, it's made and the reasons're explained; if it was to get back to your senses and find a reason to fight for, the character gets up and receives an appropriate combat bonus.<br/>
<br/>
Flashforwards have two significant differences: first, they can involve existing characters ("ok, tomorrow evening I'll drop in to see you"); second, they can be played simultaneously with the main storyline in the case of a forum-based game (the goal does not have to be reached here and now). I could show you a nice example, but yet again, guess what language it's in?<br/>

I hope I answered the question (and hope I didn't type too much ;) ).                        </div>

                            I'm not sure if it's quite what you're after, but my game in development, <a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/taxonomy/term/60" rel="nofollow">Six Bullets for Vengeance</a>, runs time backwards. It starts with the climax and leaps backwards via scenes and chapters towards the start of the story. It works pretty well, especially when you bring revelations and foreshadowing into it.<br/><br/>I've always been interested in playing with time in games. I think a game that used real time somehow would be cool, maybe something like 24 with the players against the clock.                        </div>

                            I am fiddling with a time travel project called 'Stitch' that will use time in a real way. Basically players will only have limited amount of time in the past to prevent a future crisis happening. It will be a game about doing what is necessary versus doing what is right. At the moment it is just notes though. Might see if I can wangle a playtest version together for conpulsion.<br/><br/>Any other good time travel games out there?<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Iain                        </div>
