The plan seems to have been that modules from Sweet20 could be applied piecemeal to D&amp;D 3E, or with all the modules you could play without D&amp;D 3E altogether.<br/><br/>The only module that I can find is <a href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/sweet20/" rel="nofollow">experience</a>, which was based on Keys from <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> (you might know them from <i>Lady Blackbird</i>). But it got me thinking: there's been nine years of new RPGs since TSOY; what could they contribute to D&amp;D?<br/><br/>The one thought that came straight away to me seems like a cop out, but here it is:<br/><br/>In <i>Love in the Time of Sei\xf0</i>, players can choose what the places look like, choosing from three options. I think that would be a cool approach for magic items and monsters. <br/><br/>THE MEDUSA<br/><br/>The medusa is:<br/><br/>A writhing mass of snake heads that slides onto the heads of virgins and controls them.<br/><br/>A snake-tailed monstrosity, hooded and fork-tongued, with snakes for hair.<br/><br/>A statuesque woman dressed in a wine-dark robe, with an aura of coral snakes about her head.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411893/#Comment_411893" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-12T05:57:30+00:00" title="April 12, 2013  5:57AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dungeon World?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411898/#Comment_411898" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-12T08:02:44+00:00" title="April 12, 2013  8:02AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would like to see more of these ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411931/#Comment_411931" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-12T18:02:01+00:00" title="April 12, 2013  6:02PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Dungeon World?</blockquote>\n<a href="http://livinglibre1.wordpress.com/2013/04/06/download-grim-portents-issue-1-here-submissions-open-for-issue-2-theme-the-wine-dark-sea/" rel="nofollow">I really like Dungeon World.</a><br/><br/>But it's not what I'm looking for here - at least, not in its entirety.

'Contribute'? That's harder to pin down. I guess I'd say 'Improve the play experience for you, without changing the fundamentals of the game'. So Scrape's tiered success is cool, I think you could make a module that gave tiered successes that would fit well with the rest of the game. If he'd said 'Delete the skills chapter.

But combat, way too often, is about standing around hacking away to see who takes more damage faster. We still have tactical stuff, and there's plenty of nail-biting tension all over the place (especially when the "killer DM" is running the game), but I still find it too slow with not enough effective options other than attacking, or using a spell or magic item.<br/><br/>So my World of Algol thing was basically me using Apocalypse World to run old school D&amp;D. For my particular style of DMing, it worked great. The one player who loves over the top scams and always tries to hoodwink NPCs got to be more effective at it, and since in that first game I started them off with AW-equivalent weaponry, at the end of four sessions they had literally obliterated my semi-mega-dungeon. It was probably faster than Dungeon World, too, because I used AW-style harm and then reduced that capacity in the later, more-hacked version.<br/><br/>Probably the one downfall is that because combats went faster, the PCs moved through the dungeon faster, and because the DM has to show up with a finished dungeon, that means more prep time. If I were to run this kind of game even every two weeks, I don't think I would be able to keep up. This, incidentally, is a non-negotiable part of the essence of old school d&amp;d for me, so switching to the AW/DW style where you make things up during the game isn't an option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411994/#Comment_411994" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-14T10:41:20+00:00" title="April 14, 2013 10:41AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2013 10:55AM by WarriorMonk.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, sadly nothing beats a good ol prep. Sadly, because it takes a lot of time to prepare for a session and not everything gets used (tough it can be recicled for later) and even then players might go and find a good reason and way to avoid entirely whatever you prepped. And then you can't just do all the prep for your campaign in one seat, you'll need to prepare most stuff only for the next session cause you won't know what will happen then.<br/><br/>And boy d20's math makes that laborious if not complicated (though not impossible, I admit). So I always pick any system with simple prep over d20 any day, or hack my own like I'm doing right now.<br/><br/>The other option of course is to do prep on one seat and railroad like a god. Which isn't as a bad experience as it may sound to some people, if you've got a GM good at that. That detailed prep certainly pays a lot.<br/><br/>Uh, but the point is about contribution: I'd say it depends on what do you want to add to the game. You don't like combats taking so long? Other than houseruling, you'll need an entirely different system, sorry. An you'll be taking tactical gaming (but not tactical thinking) out of it. You don't like it being so lethal or want more acting from the players? Rip off the Aiki chits system pron Tenra Bansho and use it like story points                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412005/#Comment_412005" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-14T18:51:52+00:00" title="April 14, 2013  6:51PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some discussion along these lines over here: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18148/partial-success-in-d20-systems#Item_29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18148/partial-success-in-d20-systems#Item_29</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412021/#Comment_412021" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-14T22:44:29+00:00" title="April 14, 2013 10:44PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Railroading isn't an option either, because the players are exploring a location, not pursuing adventure goals and fighting opponents. I guess the dungeon could be linear, but players who are cool with the GM saying "this is the only dungeon I've got prepped so this is the dungeon you're going into tonight" will still get bored by that.<br/><br/>For the last few years I mostly dealt with this by running mostly one-page dungeons. They don't always tend to tie together into a coherent setting or campaign, though. Stuff like threat countdowns (fronts and dangers in Dungeon World) are good for adding that, although if you don't have time to prep dungeons, you likely don't have time to prep countdowns either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412028/#Comment_412028" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T00:03:42+00:00" title="April 15, 2013 12:03AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The place I first posted these doesn't exist anymore, but here's an old idea I had called <a href="http://ww.w.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/101526" rel="nofollow">Say Yes or Face the Dungeon</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412036/#Comment_412036" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T04:41:22+00:00" title="April 15, 2013  4:41AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The place I first posted these doesn't exist anymore, but here's an old idea I had called <a href="http://ww.w.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/101526" rel="nofollow">Say Yes or Face the Dungeon</a>.</blockquote>\nI love it! The one thing that gives me pause is the stakes-setting. Is there a way to do the same dungeon-as-conflict-resolution without drawing the players out of the fiction to negotiate stakes? (Others' opinions on stakes-setting may vary of course - feel free to convince me otherwise in whispers or whatever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
