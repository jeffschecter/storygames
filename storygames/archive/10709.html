In order to do that I need people to help me playtest it over Skype. It's a GM-less no-prep game with an interesting situation generation mechanic (inspired by In A Wicked Age, but with less pre-authored content) and an attempt at a story structure that mimics the source literature rather than a "D&amp;D adventuring party" structure.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
