I'm new to the forums, but I thought I'd dive in head-first. <br/><br/>I've been involved in the hobby for more than a decade now, and most of that time was spent GMing. Most of <i>that</i> time was spent GMing homebrew games. There are very few things my group has played without tweaking it half to death in the process. <br/><br/>Recently, I've been really wanting to do something as a real project from the ground up - ending in a real book, with art, layout, and the whole shebang. I'm a graphic designer by trade. That will be easy. What will be hard is making the game itself. <br/><br/>I'm choosing my topic as a labor of love - I want to make a late bronze, early iron age game in the sword-and-sandals(-and sorcery!) genre. I've always loved the era and genre and I'm a big history nerd, so parts of this won't be too hard. On the other hand, I recognize what a big project this will be and so I thought I'd turn it loose to the public and get some feedback along the way. This is where you come in.<br/><br/><div style="margin: auto;"><br/><img alt="image" height="444" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OtBegT1WpS8/TuJS4cY-ScI/AAAAAAAABwU/6R7leCfZfPE/s1600/hoplite_by_cyclops854-d4f7gdx.jpg" width="500"/><br/></div><br/><br/>Here are my guidelines so far:<br/>* It's going to be loosely based on the system used by SOTC and Chronica Feudalis. My current group discovered CF and loved it. I have been keeping a campaign/changes bog here: <a href="http://polyhedralpleasure.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://polyhedralpleasure.blogspot.com</a><br/><br/>* I want to keep the core flexibility of Chronica Feudalis, but I don't mind slight additional crunch. Even our medieval group (in the link) expanded some on the core rules.<br/><br/>* I'm not going for absolute historical accuracy. I want it to be a "bronze age world" in the same way middle earth is early medieval. Thus we have a lot of room to play with.<br/><br/>* Greek settings, whether in movies, books, or games, tend to fall into one of three categories in terms of realism. The first is simply historical fiction. There are quite a few books that go into this style of setting. HBO's Rome is a good example. The second is mostly historical, but in some ways over-the-top or represents supernatural forces in an obscure, dark and sinister way without totally proving them. 300 and Spartacus are both excellent examples of almost film-noir style larger than life settings. Troy did this as well. The third category goes all the way into mythic elements, with the central characters often demigods, or with great monsters and things walking the earth. Clash of the Titans did this. Not well, but they did it. All of Homer falls into this.<br/><br/>I want the setting to fall somewhere in the middle, with elements of dark and gritty fantasy - quite probably with a Robert E Howard Hyborea / H.P. Lovecraft Cthulhu Mythos undertone. Never quite falling into the "wizards guild" level of fantasy, but with weird and unsettling occult and supernatural elements blended in.<br/><br/>* The setting will be drawn from elements of classical Greece, Homeric Greece, early Rome, and some of the bronze age civilizations - Crete, Egypt, Babylonia, Israel, etc. I'd also like to include some bronze-age celtic and germanic flavor as well, but I'd like to avoid direct YACAPE scenarios even though I'm not entirely opposed to them. <br/><br/>* I want to write it from the ground up to capture the feel of the setting<br/><hr/><br/>So. here is the first topic of discussion. What can we do to make this feel like a bronze/iron age setting, beyond changing the available weapons and armor? This isn't necessarily strictly a mechanics question at this stage, but a general area to brain storm. <br/><br/>As a secondary topic, does anyone know of an existing game that has done this well? I have read Agon, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for. <br/><br/>Thoughts?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385122/#Comment_385122" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-14T08:31:03+00:00" title="July 14, 2012  8:31AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would this setting be for the individual hero?

It isn't a bad place to start, but it isn't exactly my 'kind' of game, with the players competing directly against each other and so forth. It does have some interesting elements though. At the moment, I'm toying with the idea of some kind of meta-game mechanic for including elements like Destiny, Hubris, Nemesis, and other major themes from greek mythology but I fear that might be too far into the third category of "gods walk among us" kind of fantasy and I'm not sure that's where I want it just yet. <br/><br/>I tried looking at the zenobia stuff, but the pdfs don't seem to exist anymore on that site.

I'm at that stage where I know quite a bit about various cultures in the time period, but I still haven't crystallized exactly how to translate that into something fit for human consumption. You did raise some interesting angles to look at from though. <br/><br/>In the end, I think I want to wind up with something like a bronze-age saga with a character-centric focus in the style of George R. R. Martin, with a little bit of Cthulhu darkness hiding in the uncharted regions of the map. Players should be Spartacus or Leonidas - individual mortals from various walks of life with the ability to cause far-reaching change. The movie Troy actually does this beautifully. It retains all the feel of a greek epic tragedy, and is entirely centered on the main personalities involved but without having the gods show up and minimize their importance. <br/><br/>I'm going to think on this more and post my thoughts.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385329/#Comment_385329" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-17T22:15:22+00:00" title="July 17, 2012 10:15PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2012 10:16PM by Irminsul.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>At the moment, I'm toying with the idea of some kind of meta-game mechanic for including elements like Destiny, Hubris, Nemesis, and other major themes from greek mythology...</blockquote>\nThe sci-fi Greeks-in-space game <a href="http://www.hellasrpg.com/" rel="nofollow">Hellas</a> has similar mechanics [Destiny/Fate, Honor, Glory, etc.] -- so it might be worth checking out -- there are quickstart rules and previews and such in that link.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385333/#Comment_385333" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-17T23:02:18+00:00" title="July 17, 2012 11:02PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2012 11:06PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think I want to wind up with something like a bronze-age saga with a character-centric focus in the style of George R.

What kinds of stories are we telling? Who are the characters? Is there a "party" (a problem for a lot of games which seek to emulate certain types of fiction, and particularly something like Game of Thrones, although it may be well-suited to a group of Hellenic heroes traveling together).<br/><br/>As for the supernatural issue, my personal interest would in maintaining the gods as a source of power and influence, but making it very ambiguous as to whether they really exist, or there's something else at play. (A bit like religion in George R.R. Martin's stuff, perhaps.)<br/><br/>Have you read Ilium, by Dan Simmons? It's not strictly related to what you're doing, but has an interesting "modern" take on the Iliad. You might really enjoy it, if you aren't familiar with it already.<br/><br/>What is a YACATE scenario? That reference lost me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444591/#Comment_444591" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-05T21:37:34+00:00" title="April  5, 2015  9:37PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2015 9:38PM by AsIf.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What is a YACAPE scenario?</blockquote>(fixed typo) <br/>Judging from the context, I'm gonna guess:<br/>You Actually Can't Avoid Playing Europeans   :-&gt;<br/><br/>Hey <a href="/forums/profile/jacksonmalloy">@jacksonmalloy</a> - another game to check out might be "The Atlantean Trilogy" from Bard Games.  This is an oldie from the 80s.  I never liked the system enough to run it, but that didn't stop me from getting use out of it: The sourcebooks are filled with excellent material for a global bronze-age campaign.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
