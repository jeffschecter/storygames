The person who never roleplayed before rocked our worlds. <br/><br/>The guard went looking for a missing grain peddler. Why? Gwendoline, leader of the guard, suspects she's a spy. The guard do the usual, fight snakes, nearly die, suffer grievous wounds, interrogate the peddler, and confirm she is indeed a spy. All pretty standard stuff.<br/><br/>Then the person (a young teenager) new to roleplaying games turns to everyone and says, "maybe Gwendoline deserves to be spied on."<br/><br/>What followed was 2 back to back sessions (4 hours total) that went from fighting snakes to political intrigue and Gwendoline's assassination. Lockhaven broke into riots. The assassin was caught but before he could admit who was really responsible was killed by another player because of a personal vendetta. So the other player (the person new to roleplaying) got away with it. He took over Gwendoline's place. But that's not the end!<br/><br/>He won! But he was paranoid. He lived in fear that someone would find out what he did. So even though he got everything he wanted, he ran away so he wouldn't have to look anyone in the eye. And no one knows why!<br/><br/>I posted more information in a <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1124" rel="nofollow">Story Games thread here </a>(before I saw this one):\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Wow, that was just... I don't have the words... amazing is a start!<br/><br/>123 people played games and hung out! At least 55 new people! Many new to gaming! And several old friends that we missed dearly.<br/><br/>Several new people came in to check out what this social gaming thing was about for a few minutes on their way to somewhere else and then canceled their plans to stay and play!<br/><br/>1 person was on their way to a blind date and canceled their dinner plans and brought their date to Recess instead!<br/><br/>I saw people making friends, exchanging contact information, and others playing too many games to count! We definitely accomplished "make friends, play games."<br/><br/>I couldn't be happier.<br/><br/>Almost every game filled up instantly. And we kept running pickup games to fill the demand. I kept making photocopies of my gaming materials so people could run more games. I think were at least 2-3 additional on the fly mouse guard games.<br/><br/>I ran 1 mouse guard game that was was easily on my top 5 game sessions I've ever played ever!<br/><br/>There was also plenty of indie goodness including in some cases multiple games of Danger Patrol, Lady Blackbird, InSpectres, How We Came to Live Here, Burning Wheel, Burning Empires. FreeMarket, Mouse Guard, and Spirit of the Century.<br/><br/>Everyone was so enthusiastic, so positive, so happy... I was swept in by the awesomeness!<br/><br/>Now we need to find more space for more people!</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254224/#Comment_254224" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T07:40:48+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  7:40AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I must confess, I was impressed.<br/><br/>It was busy with an interesting mix of people.
