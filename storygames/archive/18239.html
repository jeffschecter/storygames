There are five major narrative arcs in the game world and several scenarios connected to each of the arcs.  Also lots of NPCs with motives that I will introduce as necessary.  I'm not bound to any particular outcome.  It's a full speed sandbox.<br/><br/>I have also found Chris Perkins' campaign advice at "The GM Experience" helpful.  Check out "<a href="http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4dmxp/20110224" rel="nofollow">Previously in Lomandra...</a>".  <br/><br/>I intend to make notes on the scenario sheets as we go and start the session with "Previously....", letting the players tell <i>me</i> what happened. They are English learners so it's a good exercise for them and will help us [and me especially] stay on story.<br/><br/>That's the plan anyhow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411448/#Comment_411448" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-06T05:58:30+00:00" title="April  6, 2013  5:58AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a crazy challenge!

I am definitely going to look for opportunities to fold students into co-GMing.  And you're right, it is definitely a good opportunity for the advanced students.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/PaulB">@PaulB</a>: Players will be in a single group but there is the chance that some will have info.  I've thought a little about this and the solution is a little mind-bending but also exciting.  Players start the game in one location with one of the five arcs providing an immediate threat.  For groups that are near to another [I'm teaching these classes among a few local colleges in Ho Chi Minh] I intend to start them in another location with another arc or immediate threat.  Managing this is will be the biggest challenge.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Biest">@Biest</a>: I have the good fortune to have been teaching a few years now and the preparation resembles how I plan for classes.  I use a standardized collection of lesson plans and tailor them to the classes.  The plan is pretty much the same: print the relevant material, make notes on the printouts during the session and immediately after and then keep it together in one place.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">@Dreamofpeace</a>: I have a system that I use when I teach and I'm adapting it for these games.  Also, and this is fun and funny to me, I have set the game world in a near future America gone nuts and each of the locations are towns and cities that I know.  The NPCs are even modeled after friends and family.  I am hoping to draw on that familiarity.  But you are right, I can't rely on the players alone.  They will tell me what has happened and then I will certainly have to elicit some of the other relevant details.<br/><br/>Wow, mostly three session maximums.

If they're totally free-standing, and the games are not really heavy on character-arc development, then I think it would not be crazy to keep notes on 15 simultaneous game-states.<br/><br/>I remember doing a fun classroom RPG in middle school that broke my class up into uh...I think four groups of 5 kids each. It was a postapocalypse scenario (it was late into the Cold War) and all four groups listened simultaneously to the same prerecorded "radio transmission." Then the teacher would have us deal with a crisis, taking into account what we'd just heard on the radio and the ongoing game-state. Then we'd have to work it out amongst ourselves (creating lots of terrific psychodrama), and occasionally interact with other survivalist groups (trading assets we'd lucked into or hoarded throughout the exercise). <br/><br/>That was, basically, four simultaneous games that touched each other once in a while. I could easily see running the same thing in four different settings, resulting in 16 games (grouped into four higher-order games).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411516/#Comment_411516" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-07T18:36:44+00:00" title="April  7, 2013  6:36PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Paul, that sounds like some of the LARP stuff Morninstar is doing now.

Again, simple game, 3 sessions only, and only three "characters" per group to keep track of. While it was pretty nuts, it was also some fundamental English grammar at the core of the teach, and overall really worthwhile.<br/><br/>But, *meaningfully*, I've only run 4 max, very briefly (one weekly, one biweekly, one monthly and one irregular; that overlap was only for about two months, before two of the games ended and we switched GMs). But the trick there was that with three of those games they were very different games, and two of them were the same system.<br/><br/>It was the ones with the same system that fucked me up the most, actually, not the wildly different ones. For example, once or twice I'd make a side-reference to a major NPC, to which the players reminded me that they didn't know that NPC ("Oh, crap, you're right, sorry; that's the other guys").<br/><br/>Good luck, tell us how it went!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mjulius" title="mjulius"><img alt="mjulius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/120/n2JOMXNIW6TVM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mjulius">mjulius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411519/#Comment_411519" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-07T20:01:21+00:00" title="April  7, 2013  8:01PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2013 8:08PM by mjulius.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">@Jason_Morningstar</a>: I thought about all the groups existing in the world [it's a great idea] but sadly nixed it.  I think that it will get too complex.

Pretty detailed early but fuzzy later with just a few notes regarding the overall likely intent of each of the organizations.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">@TomasHVM</a>: Sounds like Chris Perkins' "Previously..." and encounter notes [link above].  I like the table and players/characters names. I'm gonna use that.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/PaulB">@PaulB</a>: I am definitely keeping notes.  The plan is to copy the pages from the repository and then make notes on the sheets as we go.  If an NPC dies I'll cross them out.  I will also refer to the previous session's notes before we start.  <br/><br/>I like that middle school post-apocalyptic game.  I live for classroom psychodrama.  I did some continuing education recently and they introduced a game in which we accused three students of theft from the school, then assigned the rest of the class as police.  The accused must corroborate their stories and the police must take the stories apart by cross-examining the suspects.  I was amazed at how wound up the students got over the whole affair.  Now THAT is motivated English. It was a blast.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Andy">@Andy</a>: 19? You're the man.  I'm glad to hear that it encouraged good English.  I also like the notion of a character shared between students.  If I find myself somehow with more than six in a group, I'll use that.  The players can pair and discuss what they want their character to do.  <br/><br/>The group that I want to appeal to are college student gamers so I want the games to be as meaningful and deep as I can manage.   It's going to be an organizational challenge.

If so, you could create interesting "assignments", where a certain group's progress during a certain scenario becomes a challenge for another group. For example, we have a difficult situation--maybe some hostages must be rescued or negotiated out of some kind of conflict. Let's say they manage to rescue the hostages, but their captors get away free, and with a bunch of money or weapons (or some other resource).<br/><br/>Once the players have resolved the conflict (to some extent), you ask them: "What is difficult and challenging about the situation now? What are the dangers? What kinds of difficult choices remain?" They write down their answers (essentially, another scenario), for the next group to deal with. Who will take care of the survivors? They're running out of water. The captors are heavily armed and heading towards another village nearby. Etc, etc.<br/><br/>This way each group takes action "in the game world" and then passes on the stick to the next group of players, who must deal with the consequences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411611/#Comment_411611" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T18:30:00+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  6:30PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think my PA game was...1983?

I'm running seven groups a week currently, each for sessions 2 hours and 15 minutes. Some of my experiences may help you.<br/><br/>Here's my penny ...<br/><br/><b>First; use a good game! </b><br/><br/>- It should be much more effective in feeding the fiction than most classical game are ("more effective" = faster, easier to "read").<br/>- It should be simple to run, as in; let you make scenarios on the spot (preferably).<br/>- One die is preferable to many, sketchy characters preferable to complex (all characters grow complex in the course of game-play)<br/>- I have nothing but good experiences sharing scene-framing with my players. Let them take rounds framing scenes. They tend to feed the game with what they are interested in, lifting that responsibility from your shoulders. <br/>- Make sure your game support a broad array of themes and conflicts; in groups like the ones you plan to start there will be a broad range of interests, so you need to have a wide range of "fishing gear" to get them hooked <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>- RPGs need some time to hook the participants, so tell them up front that the first session will be a bit boring; making characters, learning the method. And tell 'em: "We'll have a great adventure when all that dreary stuff is done!"<br/><br/><b>The room is important!</b><br/>- and how you use it. You need to be undisturbed (a door to close is good). You should have as small a room as possible, and as small a table as possible. RPGs are based on dialogue, and dialogue thrives in intimate spaces. Sit close, so you may use low voices too (whispers are great for atmosphere). In a big room; use a corner, with a loose wall or shelves or curtains to make a smaller space.<br/><br/><b>Be direct, practical and positive!</b><br/><br/>- set regular times; the same time each and every week; a must if you are to cope with the many groups<br/>- be very polite to your pupils, and clear in your communications<br/>- make a blog with background-info for the games<br/><br/>- be very friendly and welcoming the first session; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shake hands with each and every player</span> (even if that feels a bit "special"), say your name and ask for theirs<br/>- tell the players this is for FUN, and most fun will be had if all is playing along, treating their characters with serious intent, doing their best to survive<br/>- establish group-loyality: make it clear that they are meant to collaborate on the challenges you throw at them<br/>- entice them: tell them you are meant to play non-player characters nice AND WICKED for them to meet<br/>- help them along! You need to be helpful to make game-play fun for them; RPGs have some codes which is hard for some to crack; give them time by being patient and helpful as game-play proceeds<br/><br/>- do NOT use a GM-screen; it detracts from your communication with the players, and anything you could put on it may be put on the table, or in a chair beside it<br/>- make yourself a game-sheet for each group; with names of players and CHARACTERS <br/>- be sure to write down what happens during each session, on the back of the game-sheet<br/>- invite players to re-tell last session at the start of a new one<br/><br/>- let game-play build and develop in liege with player initiatives, but be not afraid to make your mark on the fiction; you are a leading player, so lead by example<br/>- look for dramatic opportunities all the time; play the table, play the group, play each and every player<br/>- have fun!<br/><br/>- use the alarm on your bright new and shiny smart-phone to keep time, so you may engulf in the sessions as a focused and engaged man <br/><br/>Invite players to laugh a lot, and invite them to be serious and focused too. A good mixture will earn you their friendship, gratitude and respect. Use that to make the sessions a good time for all of you<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411781/#Comment_411781" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T15:12:08+00:00" title="April 10, 2013  3:12PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another great post from Tomas!<br/><br/>Following up a little on the "written" component, I think it would be pretty cool to have the students write letters "in character" in order to communicate with other characters or other groups. If the outcome of the story is dependent on their writing good, informative letters, this would be a great spur to developing writing skills. <br/><br/>For example: in session 8, you find out that a group of bandits is coming to attack the Farm at sunrise two days from now, and that they will most likely be approaching from the North on snowmobiles (!).<br/><br/>If the players can write a good letter explaining all this to the other group (their friends who live at the Farm), they have a chance to survive the attack.

Nice to hear that this is useful to you! I've done this for a long time, as said, and my system has been carefully crafted and re-crafted through the years. These things works for me. If they work for you too, all the better.<br/><br/>Forgot to mention three important tidbits:<br/><br/>- Make yourself a <b>list of names</b> suitable for the setting; one column of male and one of female names. Include columns of names for different regions and races, if needed. Keep these names in front of you during play. It makes it easy to come up with names for NPCs invented during the game.<br/><br/>- Make a <b>resource-sheet</b> with useful information on the setting; names for inns, coins, wares, tools, weapons, travel-gear, etc. Include info on traditions like summer-festivals and well-known songs and tales, and info on ethics too (a list of virtues and sins). Make it a double-sided sheet to hand out to players during play. It will help them establish a framework for the setting for themselves, and enable them to frame great scenes for you all. It will help you too.<br/><br/>- Make a simple <b>scenario-sheet</b> with 5-7 elements in LARGE LETTERS on it, for each game session. Place it in the center of the table, visible for all, and tell the players these are the elements of the scenario. Tell them they may frame scenes with these elements, if they want to, or they may leave those scenes to you. The elements may be marked by dots or numbers. If dots; you may frame scenes on any element. If numbers; you must frame a scene with element number 1 before you can introduce number 2, and then 3, etc. You may keep an element hidden (on the back of the sheet, or on another sheet), to surprise the players, if the scenario calls for it. You have done some thinking, of course, of how the elements interconnects, but you have not <i>fixed</i> the connections. You need to keep the the substance of each element and the connections between them open, to cater for player ingenuity. This way of doing scenarios goes very well with classical rpgs, and helps players understand what is going on. It is a simple way of increasing the pleasures of interaction for the players. You will find it makes the games much easier to lead too! And it makes for more fun, and more excitement, on your part.<br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_411812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411812/#Comment_411812" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T23:49:30+00:00" title="April 10, 2013 11:49PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2013 1:47AM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The large and open scenario-sheet is a simple way of "framing the scenario".<br/><br/>An example of a numbered scenario-sheet:<br/><br/><i>1 - RONDIAN, a disgruntled guard<br/><br/>2 - THE BUCKET, a hidden inn<br/><br/>3 - The last words of a DYING RASCAL<br/><br/>4 - THE CELLARS<br/><br/>5 - ACID-WORMS!<br/><br/>6 - An old and wicked <b>DRAGON!!!</b></i><br/><br/>As you see; this is numbered, so the guard must be first in line, and so on. You mark the elements as they are introduced, so there is no doubt about what is available. And the players may re-visit any element, of course, if possible within the confines of the narrative.<br/><br/>The list lays out the road to adventure quite clearly to the players, and helps them envision some possible venues of play. It also helps them understand each scene in the larger context of "what is really going on here". The things you as a leader has to pay attention to, is to remind them that the list contains elements <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not known to their characters</span>, and to observe <i>the confines of the narrative</i> (obstacles, challenges, misfortunes) as they present themselves in the course of play.<br/><br/>Here's an example of a dotted scenario-sheet:<br/><br/><i>*   LAVINIA, the whore<br/><br/>*   AMBARIAN Rosythorn, the prince<br/><br/>*   LUDO, ambassador from the Kingdom of Lucia<br/><br/>*   THE SCEPTER, an ancient artifact<br/><br/>*   A DARK STRANGER<br/><br/>*   THE GREAT TOURNAMENT<br/><br/>*   Queen PARTHANIA Rosythorn</i><br/><br/>Dotted elements makes the players free to visit any element on the list whenever they want, bar special hindrances that may be placed in their way during earlier scenes. This way of "framing scenarios" are well fitted to play on intrigues and other conflicts of complexity. As the elements are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">talked</span> about you mark them with a slash, and when they are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">visited</span> you make the slash into a cross (and you may keep adding crosses to mark several visits). You also make notes on the elements if necessary; a single word may be enough to help you and the players remember a secret or quality that surface during play.

I tend to do it in sets of 2-3 groups and round it up with them all meeting eachother in person for the first time (In some cases, OOC AND IC) and finding out why the campaigns had ended up conspiring themselves as such.<br/>What I found really useful was designing NPC/plot flowcharts. Have you ever played Chrononauts? The layout of the game has flipping of cause cards causing effects later down the line. Something very similar and ripply tends to occur if you try and run multiple groups through at the same time. You need to do very very little work beyond some simple NPCs, and you can rely on the actions of each PC group to play the GM role for you in the next session with the next group. This also gives a great way to PLAN sessions inbetween, in that by using a single planning document, rather than 15 separate ones, and marking inputs and outputs, rather than a list of actions performed by the groups, you can observe from the meta scale what is occurring to the world and how it might respond in kind. <br/><br/>If you are planning on same set up and with the groups not interacting, I feel like it might increase workload despite outward appearances. Players have a tendency to be wildly varying in their actions and reactions to events, so whilst you might all start at the same point 1, group one will end up at Z, group 2 at M, group 3 at ; and group 4 at smiley kitty face, so to speak.<br/> <br/>Also Tomas provides some really useful framing and adventure advice that I might have to crib next time I try to run a simultaneous world...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mjulius" title="mjulius"><img alt="mjulius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/120/n2JOMXNIW6TVM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mjulius">mjulius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411882/#Comment_411882" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T19:55:22+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  7:55PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2013 8:04PM by mjulius.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">@TomasHVM</a>: All great stuff.  Like James, I'm cribbing large swathes of it.  You need a site!  Get this together in a FAQ.  I had this idea after teaching only six months but didn't really know how I would implement it until two years later.  I looked online and found a couple of ESL teachers who had tried it but they had no real teaching goals. Even on a quick stroll through Story Games I found another ESL teacher lamenting this as a kind of dream opportunity.  The time is now as it seems like a lot of people are rubbing the computer screens out of their eyes.<br/><br/>I've built a simple blogger thing with a few pages and the intent to document the progress so that I can communicate to players and other teachers can see a path..  I will probably fold a lot of what you have offered into it [attributed of course].  It's still a car wreck but have a look: <a href="http://d20.mjulius.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://d20.mjulius.com</a>  Truthfully, though, I would like to see you make something.  There are a lot of ESL resources out there but nothing like that.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">@James_Fleming</a>: You know, I've been getting a lot of messages suggesting that I keep them in the same world [not just the same setting] and I have resisted but seeing that last post makes it clear that I have to rethink this.  I've assumed divergent paths but your point re: the degree of divergence is taken.  I mean, what the hell am I going to do with semi-colon and kitty face!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_411885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411885/#Comment_411885" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T21:07:16+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  9:07PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2013 9:11PM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Mjulius! Crib it, please do! These things are parts of the new edition of the fantasy rpg <i>Fabula</i>. It's in Norwegian, so I presume the full text and method will not be available to you. <br/><br/>I do not have an English blog, so if you want to post any of this on your site, please do! I would appreciate acknowledgements, of course.<br/><br/>By the way; I saw on your blog that you are "waiting out for D&amp;D Next". I seriously doubt that game to be able to deliver on the level you need. It's an old game, and full of old stuff that sets limitations to your game-pace and methodic flexibility. I doubt that the game will be transformed into the thing you need. So I would advice searching for something more modern and effective, or making something yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411895/#Comment_411895" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-12T06:09:25+00:00" title="April 12, 2013  6:09AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2013 6:11AM by thadrine.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            5 Games at once. <br/><br/>3 were Dresden Files games all set in different cities at the same time, in the same over all story. <br/><br/>1 was Burning Empires <br/><br/>1 was my weekly online Games on Demand group.
