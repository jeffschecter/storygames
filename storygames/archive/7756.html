The drive is about five hours, and everybody takes a shift behind the wheel.  I GM the game, so sometimes I wind up skipping my driving shift (or I make it up on the trip in the other direction).  The players roll their own dice, except for the driver, who's dice are rolled by the GM  (I use a rolling app on my Palm rather than physical dice, when I'm in the car).  That campaign has been through three different rules systems over the years; we're currently using a homebrewed PDQ/FATE crossbreed.  No minis or battlemat needed, only 2d6 required for dice, so it's <i>just</i> component-light enough to play in a car.  In terms of concentration for the driver, the trip is basically one straight run on a highway for five hours, so reacting to traffic, following directions, etc. is not really a problem.  It probably helps that the flow of our game is fairly slow-and-talky -- although we have had one car-session that involved a space battle, the defense of an orbital outpost from pirate boarding parties, a Kamikaze attack in a disabled fighter-craft, and a John Woo-esque temple-to-temple blaster standoff between one of the PCs and the pirate captain. High action throughout!  For the space battle and the outpost defense I did sketch maps on paper and pass them to the players in the back seat.  The driver had to contend with just my descriptions of where the other ships were.  <br/><br/>In retrospect, I maybe should have been alarmed that the driver of the vehicle I was riding in was, in her mind, Kamikazeing the figher-ship she was piloting into a pirate spacecraft, and ejecting just before impact...<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172087/#Comment_172087" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T08:46:04+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  8:46AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So this is interesting timing. For the past couple months, I've been working on a car-portable/road-trip-specific RPG. The VERY rough draft of it goes like this:<br/><br/>* License plates generate lists of numbers and letters<br/><br/>* Road sign colors generate specific in-game events -- yellow warning signals are dangers, red signs mean fighting, blue signs mean an NPC wants to talk to you, etc.<br/><br/>* The players have a single sheet of paper. This paper is folded once from top-to-bottom, and once from side-to-side. It is normally read unfolded. Folding the character sheet heightwise reveals a second column of information on the back that becomes available to you under certain circumstances -- like, to resolve some colors of sign-generated events. Folding the character sheet widthwise reveals half of that other back-side column, except obviously upside-down when folded that way. My thinking was that upside-down information represented adversity.<br/><br/>* My thinking, for car-RPG purposes, was that you'd have one long column of letters, A-Z, that ran down the far left side of the back of the paper. A-M would be entries for "useful" assets -- allies, equipment, safe locations, etc. N-Z would be liabilities like enemies, monsters, curses, etc. It's the N-Z list that would flip "up" when you folded your sheet widthwise.<br/><br/>* One train of thought I was pursuing was that any given asset/liability in the game would be "resolveable" via three steps: Reveal, Challenge/Transform, Resolve. Verrrry very simple and rough here. So, like, under "A" you might have "My Best Friend and Protector, Philip." But he's not part of the game fiction 'til you've had your Reveal scene with him. Once revealed, the next scene would be either a challenge or a transform (maybe depending on which color road sign brought the element into play) -- a challege might be to the friend/protector role of that character; a transform might change Philip to an enemy.<br/><br/>There's more than that, but that's the very rough gist. One two-sided piece of paper, a list of 13@ assets and liabilities, random value and event generation based on what you see on the road.<br/><br/>If there's any more interest I could build out my notes in more detail.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao" title="sacredchao"><img alt="sacredchao" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao">sacredchao</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172230/#Comment_172230" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T23:28:57+00:00" title="September 30, 2008 11:28PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've used "guess a number between 1 and 10" pretty effectively for resolution.
