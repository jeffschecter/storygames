<p>Ok, I posted a couple crappy AP posts about the most recent <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rpgjunkie74/infected.html" rel="nofollow">Infected</a> playtest here and at the Forge.  It's awfully telling when even your own playtesters aren't interested in your AP posts.  So, in the interest of stretching my AP-post-muskles, I offer this new &amp; improved reflection on Friday's game.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>What went right</h3>
<h4>Dependants</h4>
<p>I'd added the Dependant rules only a day or two before the playtest.  The idea was to "add a slice of Nar pickle to the big, fat GAM hamburger of play"  I think it turned out pretty well.  I can't name a single PC from that session, but I can tell you all about Rachel, the not-a-girlfriend tagalong that turned to a speaker-headed monster.  I can tell you about little Jennifer, rescued from the Hospital after the loss of Rachel.  There was The Ringmaster, insane mentor to Remi's character, and Prof Goatboy, master of higher mathmatics.  I loved them all and they all stuck in my head as groovy and fun.</p>
<h4>Act 4, the Final Stand, and Waystations</h4>
<p>In the early drafts, these three elements were very rigid.  In Act 4 the characters were all expected to travel from one location to another in order to survive the city, and for the players to be able to declare that they 'won' the game.  I was regularly dissapointed at how terribly confined this seemed, so I incorporated the current reading of the Final Stand and Waystation locations.  I was pretty nervous.  I was afraid that allowing PCs to arrive at the Final Stand location early would be tactially unfun, meaning that it would be too much of an advantage for the players.  Turns out those fears were pretty much unfounded.  The finale was pretty exciting and, IMO, probably had some of the most fun narration of the game.</p>
<h3>What went wrong</h3>
<h4>Used up locations and the OverRun</h4>
<p>There was one GM action where Ully's character, Andy's character, and Remi's character were all in the same place and I mistakenly assumed that they'd like to stay there into the next phase.  But when I initiated an Over Run action I immediately got the vibe that no one cared that the Industrial Complex was about to turn to dust.  Everyone was ready to move on anyway.  After all, the Hardware and Comfort of the place had been used up.  Suddenly I was faced with a terrible situation;  There was no win or loss condition for the combat that was starting up.  If the location was OverRun, no one cared.  If the location was not OverRun,  no one cared.  Crap.</p>
<p>We fixed the situation with a stop-gap measure of no longer having Comfort or Hardware reduced as part of an Arm Up or Relax action.  This change in the rules may stick to later versions.</p>
<h4>Act 1 and starting "Everywhere Else"</h4>
<p>This rule effectively -requires- that the game start out with a bunch of un-connected Travel actions.  I'm concerned that it's crappy crappy pacing to start a game out with.  I'm further concerned that it's just unfun and unnecessary.  If that's so, then I need to figure out what other way the game might get started up and how to make sure play is invigorated from word one.</p>
<h4>Agendas did not fire like I wanted them to.</h4>
<p>Now, it seemed that everyone enjoyed their own independant Agenda stories.  Problem was that while one player was telling the story of their Agenda, everyone elses' eyes kinda glazed over.  Agendas kept PC and players in bubbles to themselves.</p>
<p>In my eyes, this was the most severe failure of the game on Friday.  Everything else was about tuning.  With a little help I've come up with a possible solution to this problem.  I've posted the basic framework of new Agenda rules <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18635.0" rel="nofollow">over at the Forge.</a></p>
<hr/>
<p>That's all that's coming to mind right now, although I'm sure there were other things.  With a little luck my playtesters from that night will show up and talk about what they saw going well and going poorly.</p>

                            I agree when it comes to the agendas.  I did mine pretty much straight out the gate and I can honeslty say, it was pretty lame.  At least in my mind it was.  <br/>
<br/>
Since you placed the rule that you could only play your agenda in a location you authored, I think that in and of itself is part of the reason that we were in our own 'bubbles'.  We -had- to go our seperate ways if we wanted to get our agendas.  Or at least that's what we all ended up doing.<br/>
<br/>
As for starting out in Act I.  I was thinking, the GM authors three locations. Why not roll a d3 and that determines where the players start.  This may end up with a few of us together.  It might end up with us seperated (depending on size of the group).  That would be one way to get people to start acting together or against each other pretty quick I think.<br/>

<p>Lisa,</p>
<p>Yer right, the "Roll for Agendas only in the locations you authored"-rule was completely in opposition to what I wanted the Agendas to do.  I remember what my train of thought was when I made that rule, but it falls right into the category of rules that one makes to ensure that players are going to do what players are going to do with or without your rules.  If that makes any sense at all.</p>
<p>Random assignment of PCs in Act 1?  Eww.</p>
<h6>(Lisa and I actually talked about this via IM before I decided to bring the results back here.)</h6>
<h3>This is what I think may work a little better;</h3>
<ul>
<li>The GM authors 3 locations pre act 1.</li>
<li>Players can choose any one of the three locations to start their PC off in.</li>
</ul>
<p>And um... that might be it.  The real solution may be in other rules.  Sidelines.  Like a better solution to the OverRun/AssetReduction stopgap rule.</p>
