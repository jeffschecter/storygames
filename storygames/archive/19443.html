They are now on board with the idea of shared narrative creation. But sometimes, especially at the start of a new game/arc, I feel that when I ask a leading question it generates a deluge of content that is hard for everyone to incorporate or engage with.<br/>Am I wrong?

There are games and creative priorities where that genuinely is what people want, but for the majority of roleplayers (story games, traditional, whatever) the shared narrative powers aren't the true point of the exercise. This can then result in a sort of "false consciousness" similar to when freeformers convince themselves that their play is great now because they don't have dice and rules spoiling it. The reality might not be so simple.<br/><br/>That is obviously just a guess. If it seems like it might fit, you might consider toning down the methodological emphasis on shared narratives in favour of other things that the group actually wants and likes.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you're convinced that you want shared storytelling, then a good rules-system that actually does that is a must. Going with a Story Games darling is a foolish thing in this context; just because it's called "story games" doesn't mean that it is technically about shared narratives - most story games are explicitly not. We've seen many cycles of people playing games like say Primetime Adventures with the expectation that they're more refined takes on Once Upon a Time, just because they're termed "story games". The choice of game has to be based on the factual properties of the game, not on hyped up assumptions.<br/><br/>To give an example of the difference, consider <i>Apocalypse World</i> vs. <i>Microscope</i>. One of those games has a creative agenda of experiencing and exploring meaningful stories, while the other is all about celebrating shared creativity and riffing off the contributions of the other players. I'm not saying which is which (such a difficult riddle), but the point is that one of those games incorporates the kinds of creative bursts that you describe, while the other does not. If you decide that you'd like to explore the possibilities in unconstrained narrative control more deeply, choose a game that makes use of and assumes such behaviour.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432814/#Comment_432814" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-19T05:30:38+00:00" title="May 19, 2014  5:30AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found that it is often beneficial to facilitate strongly and edit judiciously, even in games whose rules promote equal responsibility around the table. <br/><br/>As Eero suggests, different games handle this in ways that may work better or worse for your particular group, so try different things.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432816/#Comment_432816" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-19T05:56:13+00:00" title="May 19, 2014  5:56AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main thing is for the group to incorporate/reincorporate and accept.

If no ideas get weight, your shared fiction is light and flimsy and easy to rip apart or blow away. When you have enough weighted ideas, and relationships between ideas, the fiction holds together and is strong enough to really play with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432817/#Comment_432817" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-19T06:22:35+00:00" title="May 19, 2014  6:22AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And you can guide them toward that while still letting them have a lot of reign.<br/><br/>"Ok that happened.

What the hell is a hot dog cake?<br/><br/>Chocolate cake is great right? And hot dogs are also delicious, right? Hence, wouldn't a adding hot dogs to a chocolate cake make the best food ever? (... Nope. It might just be the worst food ever.) <br/><br/>Just like in cooking you need ingredients that go well together in an roleplaying/story game. What you need to do is at the first stage of the discussion get an agreement in what sort of thing you want to be doing. If you all agree that you want to make a cake, you can build on each others ideas like:<br/><br/>"Let's make a cake!"<br/>"Yeah. We all want to make a cake!"<br/>"Perhaps we could make a chocolate cake. Is everyoen okay with that?"<br/>"Yeah."<br/>"Oh! It could have frosting!"<br/>"And we could serve it with some with cream!"<br/>"I think it delicious when you add a bit of chili or cinnamon to chocolate cakes. Are you willing to try that?"<br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/>Then if someone suggests<br/><br/>"I love hotdogs! Can we add pieces of hot dogs into the batter? And perhaps some mustard? And ketchup?"<br/><br/>Then you can tell that player:<br/><br/>"Erm. Hotdogs are great and so is mustard and ketchup. But I'm not sure they would be right for a chocolate cake... Perhaps we could do something with hot dogs some other time. Is there something you like that you like in chocolate cake?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432838/#Comment_432838" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-19T15:25:59+00:00" title="May 19, 2014  3:25PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2014 9:30PM by Rickard.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure if we're going off topic because I don't fully understand the OP.\n<blockquote>The garden variety leading question in a story game is something like the following.

The examples above can put the player in the spot. I've done it to other players and seen how they froze up for a couple of seconds and I have had done to myself as well. It's not a comfortable feeling to be pressured like that. I do find the fun in playing with <i>descriptive challenges</i>. Heck, I'm currently producing <a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/tip/" rel="nofollow">This Is Pulp</a> that's all about that, but you still need something that the players can lean onto when you do that. The questions above doesn't have anything to leave. You just shove it onto the player's hands to handle it. It's like that old joke in improv: "And the next thing is a really great idea. Simon, tell me about it."<br/><br/>The other way of using leading questions is to feed creativity and you do that in the simplest way in asking yes and no questions. "Does it rain?" gives a lot to the person in question but it also gives the power of saying "no". Perhaps it doesn't rain, but the person gets an incentive of describing the weather. To feed creativity, you need to ask a lot more questions but they can create the same result. "Is something appearing in the dark?", "Is it a giant purple tentacle?", "Does it knock something over?", "Is it a vase that is knocked over?". When you create something collectively, it's good manner to accept the leading questions but even if that's an unspoken rule, it's still reassuring to be left a choice. Further on, it also leave a wiggle room. Perhaps the player answers "Yes, a strange old woman appear" to the first question. Isn't this a starting point for another question? You can find how I use leading questions in a <a href="www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19441/does-my-two-page-game-make-any-sense#Item_1" rel="nofollow">game that I posted recently</a>.<br/><br/>The trick is to listen and adapt.

When the players come up with stuff by themselves, I would rather move on to a different technique. When I play <b>InSpectres</b> or <b>This Is Pulp</b> with high player influence\u2014when they can control more than just their character\u2014I start off by explaining a ground rule: you're only allowed to give out one detail. This goes for both the game master and the players. If the characters enter a new scene, I'm only allowed to say where they are: the library. It's then up to them to fill out the scenery, but only one detail at the time per person. I can also response at any time by adding another detail to their details. This "conversation" goes somewhat like <a href="/forums/profile/w176%27s">@w176's</a> sausage cake example.<br/><br/>There can be other rules that breaks this first rule, but I wont go into that yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432852/#Comment_432852" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-20T05:54:19+00:00" title="May 20, 2014  5:54AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the absence of procedural rules like Rickard's for limiting any given player's input or for otherwise moderating a creative free-for-all, someone is still the GM. It's that person's job to make sure that each individual contribution makes sense in the context of the on-going fiction, sticks to the tone accepted or expected by the group as a whole, and is interesting in and of itself. If there's no GM, those functions still exist but are distributed to the group at large, but since you're the one asking the leading question, presumably you have the authority at the table both to ask it and to do something with the answer--the strong facilitation and judicious editing that Jason mentions. In terms of specific techniques, I often find it useful, having asked a question like, "Tell me why you're here," (in this relatively open-ended opening situation, for example) or "What's your relationship with him like?" to interrogate the player's response a little bit, to draw out its implications or potential consequences. So if the response is, "We're sworn enemies," to the second question, then I might ask, "So will you shoot him on sight, or are you trying to set up a more complicated revenge?" My goal is usually to get a sense of how to frame the situation so that the player can go into motion. "Get revenge," the player tells me, which leads to more questions. Send him to jail? Deprive him of his fortune? Steal his wife? Undermine his greatest intellectual achievement? Once I have an answer, I know more about the NPC, and the PC's adventure is practically laid out for me; all I have to do next is roll some dice. This is what Rickard means when he says "Listen and adapt."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432856/#Comment_432856" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-20T07:04:17+00:00" title="May 20, 2014  7:04AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lot of good advice here.

Creative scattershot<br/>("Spitballing", creating new material, widening out the scope of the fictional space being explored - "Oh, and there's also an island of cannibals nearby!")<br/><br/>This is, more metaphorically, "setting out on a journey". (Which often, but not always, includes establishing points of conflict.)<br/><br/>2. Resolution and reincorporation<br/>(Resolving conflicts and tying up loose ends; coming back to earlier material, reusing and transforming it - "...and it turns out the killer from the introduction was actually a cannibal from the island!")<br/><br/>This is, metaphorically (and sometimes literally), "returning home".<br/><br/>Generally speaking, you need a lot of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> to start, and less and less of it as you go along, dropping to almost none by the end (unless you want the feeling of open-endedness and incompleteness, like a movie begging for a sequel). As the game/story develops, you need more and more of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, to bring this to a close.<br/><br/>I've seen some games do this well, and some games do this poorly. Being aware of this dynamic (think of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> as the gas pedal and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> as the brake pedal in your traveling vehicle) goes a long way towards using the "right flavour" of creative input at any given time.<br/><br/>(I developed a system-agnostic technique for ending a game in an earlier Story Games thread, which is possibly up to 50% relevant here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/7806/ending-games-without-endgame-conditions/p1" rel="nofollow">Ending Games Without Endgame Conditions</a>.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
