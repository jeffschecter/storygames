We had a bunch of fun with the alpha edition, and after looking over the changes and new character options, we liked what we saw. And, since our GM for Scion was going to be late that day, we figured it was a prime opportunity for some pulp-action ass-kicking.<br/><br/>We ran a variant setting called Danger Troop, set in an alternate version of WWII, based on the ideas and feel of the Hellboy and Knights of Pendragon comics. I made up adjusted character cards (Alien was now \u201cDemon,\u201d Ghost was \u201cUndead,\u201d and adjusted the equipment to be more appropriately WWII pulp-ish). If anyone knows of a good free file-hosting site, I\u2019d be happy to post them at some point.<br/>We also have a house rule of using only blue or green 1D8s for Bonus Dice, that go in a bowl next to the red 1D6 Danger Dice bowl. That aside, it\u2019s pretty much the same Danger Patrol.<br/><br/>My friend Conrad made a Mystic Warrior named Templar (he\u2019s always a mystic\u2026this time, a religious fanatic mystic\u2026) and Johnny made a Demon Agent named Caustic Agent.<br/><br/>Anyway, the story starts with the Danger Troop aboard a Nazi luxury passenger zeppelin flying over Nazi-occupied France, disguised at a party being thrown by American starlet Vanessa Redgrave (I recycle Hollywood names all the time), who is trying to forge peace between the Allies and the Axis. The party is interrupted by Nazi agents pursuing a scraggly Russian scientist, Doctor Medyedev (terrible at spelling Russian names\u2026). One of the officers hisses \u201cYou will give us the secrets of the mountain for der Furher, or you shall die!\u201d The scientist exclaims, \u201cSo I will die!\u201d as he jumps through one of the glass observation windows. Danger Troop, to the rescue!<br/><br/>In the Previously On segment, Caustic Agent narrates how he had been tapping his contacts within Nazi Germany for information, to discover that troops and strange scientific resources were being diverted to an otherwise nondescript area in France near the Italian border. Templar was previously meditating when his daily devotions were interrupted by visions of a mighty Thunder Lizard being worshipped by a Nazi cult, and a name is whispered \u201cBaron Von Boa.\u201d<br/><br/>So, on to the action. Caustic Agent lept to the rescue, using a grapple line from his utility belt to tether the falling doctor safely, hanging outside of the zeppelin out of harms way. Templar proceeded to smash Nazis left and right with his holy hammer. The hissing Nazi turned out to be some sort of lizard hybrid that spits acid, and used it to not only damage the heroes, but to then loosen the moorings that held the primary gondola (or whatever the hell you call it) to the zeppelin itself. With the heroes occupied with that countdown threat, and with his other goons taking Redgrave hostage, he intended to make good his escape. It was not to be, however, as Caustic Agent\u2019s technical know-how, and Templar\u2019s hand of God secured the moorings once more. Caustic Agent phased through the hull to cut the Nazi off at the pass (had the Ghost\u2019s ability), while Templar blinded the others to release the hostage and defeat them soundly.<br/><br/>Cut to the first Interlude, as the zeppelin docks at a neutral Swiss port. Caustic Agent decides that he will travel to Paris with Doctor Medyedev to retrieve his papers and maps of what turns out to be an ancient volcano with a hidden Dwarven tomb inside, while Templar elects to stay behind in Switzerland to investigate the Nazi hybrid.<br/><br/>During the Suspense scene, Caustic Agent uses his contacts to sneak back into Nazi-controlled Paris, where he and the Doctor rummage through the tatters of his old office to find the papers he had hidden (while unfortunately alerting the Nazi secret police to their presence). Templar uses his ritual magics (which we said gives him x2 Trait dice when using it to solve problems during Suspense scenes) to examine the Nazi hybrid and its acid. Specifically, he wanted to find some way to counteract the acid (\u2026to which there was a silent \u201cNo, really?\u201d from Johnny and myself), and see if he could find the hybrid\u2019s weakness (which was magic).<br/><br/>From there, Templar met up with Caustic Agent and Doctor Medyedev in Paris, where they were deciphering the Dwarvish runes on the old maps, when the Nazi secret police, a Nazi Snake Cultist, and several more hybrids raid the office. These are much more advanced hybrids, as they use their arms to constrict Templar before he can do much damage. Caustic Agent pushes the doctor out a side door to safety, while fending off acid attacks. It soon gets pretty sticky, as a series of bad rolls allows the Cultist to summon poisonous snakes to nip at Caustic Agent\u2019s heels, and Templar inches closer to Vaporized. Once released from the hybrid\u2019s grip, Templar grabs Caustic Agent and teleports out of the office\u2026rather poor ending for an Action scene.<br/><br/>Our heroes split up again, with Templar staying behind in Paris to decipher the runes and maps, while Caustic Agent first tries to find the doctor (who had been recaptured outside the office), and later he heads off to the French-Italian border to find an easy route into the volcano tomb.<br/>During this Suspense scene, Caustic Agent is very successful, and describes scouting around the enemy stronghold where he finds a secret passage to the bowels of the volcano. Templar, on the other hand, discovered that the Dwarven tomb was the prison of the mighty dragon he had dreamed about before, built to contain its world-destroying power. Then he busied himself with finding out what KIND of dragon it was (snake-like, winged, feathered, lots of horns, etc.) instead of something useful to the story (like, oh, I don\u2019t know\u2026like how to defeat it???). Needless to say, I was giving him a great big raised eyebrow, in my silent \u201cWTF?!\u201d way.<br/><br/>Afterwards, he again goes to join the much more active Caustic Agent in the south of France, where they infiltrate the mountain, to the great lava pit where the dragon slept. Standing before it was none other than Baron Von Boa, leader of the Nazi Snake Cult, and his many henchmen and hybrids, draining fluids from the dragon to create the ultimate hybrid, the PanzerDragon! While Caustic Agent snuck around a bunch of Dwarven traps, Templar decided to teleport right in, to deliver \u201ca killing blow against the Dragon\u201d (his words).<br/>I should note that at this point, both Johnny and I looked up at Conrad, both with raised \u201cWTF\u201d eyebrows. This was the mighty dragon, imprisoned by the Dwarves because they couldn\u2019t destroy it, with a 3 Countdown and 3 Resistance. It was the big, big bad thing, that I was hoping they\u2019d either find a way to keep asleep, or negotiate with if it awoke (which both Johnny and I thought was perfectly reasonable, since he was a Demon).<br/>We got Templar to instead teleport in and smack Von Boa and his lead henchman (which was entirely more effective), but in turn, Von Boa was able to use a mystical Golden Coil of Doom to entrap Templar, while Caustic Agent was caught by surprise by hybrid troops. The sounds of battle also woke up the PanzerDragon.<br/>The battle was pretty intense, but Caustic Agent managed to trick the PanzerDragon into running straight into the Dwarven traps (must\u2019ve been a demonic bullfighter\u2026), while Templar was arguing that he should be able to \u201cslip out\u201d of the Golden Coil of Doom and redirect it at Von Boa, since my description apparently made it sound like it was still wrapping itself around him (I had to point out that the threat \u201cGolden Coil of Doom\u201d was indeed on the board, and on HIM, and had to be defeated if he was going to use it against his enemies).<br/><br/>Finally, while Caustic Agent was using the Dwarven runes in the prison to keep the dragon from waking, Templar managed to use the Momentum ability to kill the dragon after busting through the Golden Coil (which, I think, was probably not a proper use of that ability, but I gave it to him anyway since he had been on everyone\u2019s case about restricting him too much). This, however, used up his last Power token, and since Von Boa had been pretty much ignored for two rounds, he took the opportunity to stab Templar in the back with a wicked curved dagger\u2026which mortally wounded him. At this point, Caustic Agent only had a single Power token left too, so he used it to grab Templar and phase out of the mountain and to safety.<br/><br/>Mission successful\u2026kind of\u2026<br/><br/>Observations:<br/>Anyway, overall it was an absolute hoot. Still taking a while to get people used to the idea of providing part of the story arc for the adventure, and the Suspense scenes are still a bit clunky (I\u2019m sure when there are more examples provided, that will be of great help).<br/><br/>With the way character abilities work now, the players are taking far less Danger dice (and almost never asking anyone for additional Danger), in favor of using up their Bonus dice. Of course, then they run into the problem of running out of Bonus dice to use later. They thought it would be good if there were an Interlude after each Action AND Suspense scene\u2026I on the other hand can see that it only makes sense to have only one Interlude per pair of Action/Suspense scenes\u2026otherwise they\u2019d be using their special abilities ALL the time, and never taking any risks\u2026which is pretty much what they tried to do.<br/><br/>We also thought the 1 point Threat Move (escalation) works now should be changed. Before the Beta was released, we were treating the escalation as an automatic point of Danger added to the result of whoever attacked it, or to increase it\u2019s Threat Move if ignored. The whole rolling the die separately felt a bit against the flow of the action.<br/><br/>Other than that, the only other quibble we had was that weapons were now almost ignored (in fact, neither Templar or Caustic Agent used their Danger Troop-issued firearms at all during the adventure, in favor of their more individualized equipment). Without the special effects the weapons offered, they were just not as interesting.<br/><br/>Anyway, anybody have any suggestions or comments (particularly relating to Suspense scenes)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
