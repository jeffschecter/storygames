                    Howdy All,<br/><br/>So, in an odd and winding turn of events, I'll be attending <a href="http://www.darkcon.org" rel="nofollow">DarkCon</a> this coming weekend in Phoenix (az) while visiting some friends ... and running / demoing some Spirit of the Century, and possible other story games as well.<br/><br/>What's more, apparently I'll be on the "VIP Stage" to do so.  As I understand it, they have a separate room with a stage.  Games can be demoed and run on the stage, with audience able to watch.  I was specifically asked if I could do more presentation style, explaining to the audience what's happening, and otherwise try to enlighten the audience (in addition to the players).<br/><br/>Being me, I said "hells, yea" (and did my best Luke Crane impression).<br/><br/>Should be an interesting experience.<br/><br/>I'll be bringing SotC (duh), and probably a handful of other games I'm familiar with and can run (so, PTA most likely) as well as some of my favorites so I can talk to folks about the incredible diversity of rpgs out there (Agon, DitV, Seven Leagues, Shock, Universalis ... ?).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I can't bring everybody's game with me - please don't feel slighted if I didn't mention yours.<br/><br/>I don't know if IPR or others have any one sheets, or other small items.  I leave tomorrow at 4 pm, but would be happy to print a few copies of fliers to put on the table and use as talking sheets.<br/><br/>Yes, there was some schmoozing to get me onto the VIP table.<br/><br/>No, Fred Hicks doesn't need to bribe me ... again.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Brian                </div>

                            The demo area stage is something I want to see in action. I opted to run a couple of playtests of The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries at Dark Con rather than do demo slots (though being currently an unpublished game makes it more appropriate anyway). I know Alexander Cherry is also doing the demo stage for Fastlane throughout the con.<br/><br/>This will be my first Dark Con, and I'm hopeful the response to games outside the norm will be good. Almost all the gaming schedule is RPGA and boardgames, so something different may attract attention.<br/><br/>I'm also running a game of Dogs on Saturday morning hoping to spread the love of story games. Hopefully, Brian, we'll see each other at the con.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Eric                        </div>

                            Well, got through Friday night at the Con.  Interesting time.<br/><br/>I got the phone conversation a little jumbled - for one, I wasn't VIP, and so didn't hang out with Jewel Staite  <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/>   ... although I believe John Wick was so qualified (I'll try to hit him up for details).<br/><br/>The roleplaying was in the lower level.  Sign ups were in the little lobby area, and then there were a series of interconnected rooms, with tables for gaming.  The first such room was the "demo stage", which was a standard table, with some additional chairs gathered around audience style.<br/><br/>So, not nearly as freakish as I had worried.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> <br/><br/>John Wick ran some Discordia, and some Thirty (I didn't play, but got to BS with John, who had hoped to sit in on my SotC game).  <br/><br/>The Con seems pretty heavily d20 oriented, btw.<br/><br/>At 6:00, I set up, and despite passersby, had exactly ... 0 players.  Such is life.<br/><br/>But, after an 8:00 dinner, I came back and roped my friend and three others into an ad hoc game of SotC (my friend had been set to run M&amp;M ... then I said I'd run Spirit, and it was pulp, and everyone jumped right in). We used the pregens from the book, and I ran them through a bastardized version of Adamant's "<i>Lost Temple of the Incan Blood God</i>".  Everyone had a great time, and we broke about 1:30 am.<br/><br/>All four of the players (John, Jenny, Ben, and Harry) had never played SotC before (or really heard of it) or Fudge.  All of them were very interested in the game afterwards, and expressed interest in getting copies. <br/><br/>I'll be back tonight at 6 pm and try to engage more folks in some games, or at least some discussion about story-type games.                        </div>

                            Brian,<br/><br/>Glad you're getting some gaming going on. My three events, two playtests of my pulp exploration storytelling game plus a game of Dogs, yielded zero players in total. Pretty disappointing since I ran a great game of Dogs at Phoenix Congames over the summer. A lot of the events being run near me also never got off the ground due to a lack of players. I'm not able to be there during the evenings with a new baby in the house, but the mornings and afternoons are pretty dead other than the RPGA events. Phoenix, a gaming mecca it is not.<br/><br/>Eric                        </div>

                            Getting players signed up at cons is the next big leap forward. I recommend doing what the d20 guys do - post like mad on local gaming newsletters and in local gaming stores, try to get a blurb on the con website or in the con flyers, etc.<br/>

                            My friend that was in the dealer's room was disappointed in the con.  He estimates about 350 people in attendance.  My other friend that pulled booth monkey duty said that several events and gaming sessions were canceled and things like the non-stop anime room had nothing playing when they went.  Tuscon was about 8 tables in the dealer's room; there were fourteen(?).  Game-wise, there was one guy selling a backstock of games plus several eurogames (a pretty good selection, mind you) and two of the three Pulp Gamer podcasters who also had some games, but not too many as they didn't want to compete with the other game seller at the con.  I don't know how many units my friend sold, but from the description of the traffic in the room, he may have just broke even with the table.<br><br>One thing I have to note about the convention: the website is plain awful.  Go ahead and Google "DarkCon".  You won't find the convention's website in the first hundred hits.  Why?  It's all in flash and search engines can't read content in flash websites.  Let's say you're lucky and can find DarkCon's website (it's darkcon.org), there's nothing that tells you where the convention is.  Well, there's a page that reads "Con Hotel is the same Location, just full!" and has details all about the hotel for people to stay at, but it doesn't state that the convention is in the hotel.  As a visitor to Phoenix, I didn't know if the convention was going to be in the hotel or in a nearby conference center.   Directions or a map would have been helpful.<br/><br/>The closest I came to meeting up with others from Story Games was seeing Brian's name on the Pulp Gamers podcast newsletter sheet.  I don't know when you signed up for that newsletter, Brian, but when I signed up for it about 11 am on Sunday, there were about fifteen names between yours and mine (and three of those names were my Wednesday game group's fellow gamers that were booth monkeying.)  This might be an indication on how active the dealer's room was.                        </br></br></div>

                            Well, to wrap up, I had no takers on Sat night (I went an hour at the table - I spoke to one gentleman a little bit about SotC), and called it a night after watching the Masquerade (costume) show.  I flew out Sunday afternoon, and didn't spend anytime at the Con that day.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thomas D</cite>My friend that was in the dealer's room was disappointed in the con.  He estimates about 350 people in attendance.</blockquote>
Dunno about attendance - there definitely seemed like more people on Saturday than Friday. Agreed on the dealer's room. <a href="http://www.imperialoutpost.com" rel="nofollow">Imperial Outpost</a>, the local gamestore, had an ad in the program indicating they would be present, but were no where to be seen.<br/><br/>As a side-note, my friend did bring me to Imperial Outpost on Sunday, after breakfast.  I'll note that there were no story games on the shelves.

I chatted with one of the Pulp Gamers late morning on Friday. I was happy to see (another) podcaster there, and had a nice chat. I also picked up a nice leather laptop / book bag in the dealer's room.

Absolutely. I was there on extremely short notice; that's my story and I'm sticking to it.  <br/><br/>As last tangents:<br/><br/>I spoke at length with the founder of <a href="http://phxcongames.com" rel="nofollow">Phoenix Con Games</a>, the larger Con in the area. He's looking at about 1,500, and is looking for more games ... the con's June 14th - 17th.<br/><br/>The game of Necronomonopoly with John Wick was hysterical.<br/><br/>The con organizers were very nice people, I'll add.  I understand the con isn't considered just a game con - movies and SCA were also focal points, I think. And, apparently, the founder's party with the open bar.                        </div>
