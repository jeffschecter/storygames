There's no specific instance this is referring to, and there's no anger at specific people, but it's something that comes out of lots of occurrences over time. This also, even if it's good, isn't a rule, because obviously some circumstances are different than others.<br/><br/>You get Directed Promotion to push your own stuff. When it comes to mentioning your own games outside of that, be wary? sheepish? about it. Often, if a game you've written fits a discussion, it's probably a good thing to just be like: "Here is me making an interesting post about the issue in general. Oh, and I guess I made a game that deals with it, end of post."<br/><br/>If people want to know more, they can ask questions! If other people know about your game, they can bring up your game for you!<br/><br/>Part of roleplaying games being flexible enough to handle lots of different situations is that they could with some plausibility, be brought up in lots of different circumstances in relevant. Let's try and not use that for dubious ends and keep the self-promotion isolated.<br/><br/>If people disagree with this, feel free to disagree with me here! Let's talk it over.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449203/#Comment_449203" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-30T15:24:49+00:00" title="October 30, 2015  3:24PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has this actually been a problem?

Then again, James is basically just restating the traditional etiquette (don't drive-by advertise - engage the discussion instead) as far as I can see. It's a good etiquette, I think; using other people's discussion as a marketing platform is just crude and rude - as Immanuel Kant would have it, it's using another person as a tool instead of a goal <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Then again, I wouldn't want to go to the opposite extreme of ostracizing hobbyists who also happen to be publishers for the sake of noncommercial purity. The Finnish scene used to do that sort of thing in the early '00s, which resulted in some frankly pretty stupid moderator calls at times. The issue has never been whether some commercial effect might conceivably occur due to a public discourse (that's going to happen regardless if one allows the discussion of commercial products at all); the real issue is respect for other people and the meeting of minds, which is soiled by shallow drive-by advertising. This is why I like the traditional SG attitude of allowing people to talk about their own projects, even if those projects happen to involve products that are for sale.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449209/#Comment_449209" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-31T08:58:34+00:00" title="October 31, 2015  8:58AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read James's announcement as being, exactly, "the traditional SG attitude", summarized and clearly stated so as to be immediately accessible to any newcomers.

I haven't seen a lot of that here lately. <br/><br/>James seems to be talking about something different. For example, occasionally someone will ask "Is there a game that does X?" and I'll go "Yeah, I wrote this game called Verge; here's a link," and then we can discuss it. Allegedly, people use that as an opportunity to go on and on about their game, basically threadcrapping with their advertisement. I can't remember a case of this happening, though, so I'm wondering if we're just worrying about something that doesn't really occur. And if it does, maybe just a gentle moderator poke would fix it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449241/#Comment_449241" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-02T17:53:22+00:00" title="November  2, 2015  5:53PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2015 5:47PM by catty_big.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> in that it's probably not a huge problem at this stage, but I also agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a> in  that as there's quite a high new-join rate it's probably worth James re-stating the rules now and again.

Feeling uncomfortable self promoting and uncertainty as to how to go about it can make it really hard to actually do.<br/><br/>So posts like this are definitely helpful! Thank you.<br/><br/>I would also like to say that anyone who just wants to do a drive by promotion here is quite frankly nuts. The level of good advice and support this community has given me is invaluable and far exceeds its size. I have generally found that big forums tend to produce very little actual engagement compared to smaller and more specialised ones. If I were to rate places I shared with my kickstarter with in terms of real returns this community, and lone wolf roleplaying on google+ have been absolutely fantastic. Taking the time to stop and discuss here is definitely worthwhile.<br/><br/>I cant really keep up the sort of level of general engagement online with various forums and communities that I have been putting in for the Kickstarter - but this is somewhere I do want to maintain an active involvement. Aside from it being very relevant to my game, it feels like a natural home for discussion and sharing generally for me.
