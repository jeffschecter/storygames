                    I started a thread a few months ago asking  for advice on GMless RPGs since right now there are only 2 of us playing. The 2 most promising games I found were Polaris which didn't work out b/c it is basically a 4-player game (I want to try it some day) and Universalis which I wasn't too excited about since I was hoping for a game in which each player would have a primary PC.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised to see Universalis in my FLGS and I had no choice but to buy it. I quickly read the whole book and it helped me quite a bit. Giving some tools and confidence to play GMless. <br/>
<br/>
The system I came up with is an adapted, producerless PTA. Each one of us plays a protagonist. On our turn we ask for a scene per PTA rules and the other player acts as the producer framing the scene and "gm'ing" it. Either one has the liberty to add to the NPCs and story. Much like Universalis, we write down the important things (facts), and other we leave as color. We don't use the Universalis coin system, just accept (sometimes with a little discussion) and play along. The trickiest part was to define how to spend the budget. We use a virtual producer. It is a customized D10 with the following faces: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5. When time comes to decide how much budget to spend in a conflict, we just roll this D10. It was difficult b/c I had no prior PTA experience so it was hard to define the numbers. Initially, we tried a straight D6 (12345 and 0) and finally settled for that D10. If my FLGS had a blank D12 or D20, it would probably be even better. We distribute fan mail as per the standard rules. Since in the usual PTA games the producer also has a turn, we may also ask for scenes for the other player's protagonist.<br/>
<br/>
We had a successful first season. Right now, the second season is 3-4 scenes away from the end of the second episode and the game is red hot. I plan to post an AP sometime soon. I think one of the reasons this system is working well is b/c we chose a very familiar scenario and we have a lot of referrence. We are playing a medieval game much like Knights of the Round Table and A Game of Thrones. So, it is easy for both of us to add elements.                </div>

                            Very interesting.

                            We have some friends to play boardgames but we don't think it would work with the timeframe needed to play a RPG. Neither the 2-3 hours per session nor the regularity of sessions to keep the motivation. <br/>
<br/>
It takes long to write an AP. I wrote the first episode when we already played seven and things kept getting better as the game progressed and the characters got more development and I am afraid I will have a hard time accomplishing it.                        </div>

Can you invoke Facts in your game to get extra cards in a Conflict?                        </div>

                            We don't use facts to add any more cards to the Conflict. Universalis was mostly an inspiration. The rules are PTA's. <br/>
<br/>
I played about 14 episodes in my house. And, recently in Brazil, after we finished a 4-episode season, my friend really wanted to play some more but nobody else could and we played this version of the game and he loved it.<br/>
<br/>
To answer this last question. I don't feel PTA necessarily as a TV Show game as much as feel it as a tool to play an RPG that focus on the characters than the GM's plots and give the player more liberty to participate in creation and relieve some of the GM's burden in preparation.<br/>
<br/>
From this point of view. GM-less PTA feels almost exactly like the original game.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel PTA like a TV Show I am sure this version will do to.<br/>
<br/>
PTA is by far my favorite game/RPG. I think GM-less PTA does a good job as a playable 2-player game.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, thank you for the questions. If you ever get to play, plmk how it goes. And, any changes you made to make it work for you.                        </div>

                            There's a few things I'd like to do but don't know exactly how to balance the different elements.  I think I want just a little bit more Universalis in there.<br/>
<br/>
1) Hands: Since everyone's a Producer, representing Fan mail / Budget with a "hand" which they can throw down on extra cards in a conflict or for...<br/>
a) Bidding for scenes: Rather than taking turns, players play one card out of their hand at the beginning of a scene.  High card sets the Purpose / Location / Agenda, low card acts as Producer.  Producer gets Low Card # of cards to spend during the scene (but can also use their Hand).<br/>
b) Vetoes<br/>
c) Setting up Conventions (which can be called on in a Conflict for an extra card)<br/>
<br/>
2) Face Cards as Cues, play to gain 3 cards in your Hand:<br/>
<br/>
King of Hearts: Play this card when you make a conflict that directly addresses another protagonist's Issue.<br/>
Queen of Hearts: Play this card after a conflict that involves a romantic relationship.<br/>
Jack of Hearts: Play this card after a conflict within the ensemble about respect.<br/>
King of Diamonds: Play when you make a scene that develops the characters but doesn't have a conflict.<br/>
Queen of Diamonds: Play when you set the scene away from the main characters. <br/>
Jack of Diamonds: Play this card when you describe something important at or near the scene that the audience knows but the characters don't.<br/>
King of Clubs: Play this card when you set a Location as something in motion, like walking down a street.<br/>
Queen of Clubs: Play this when you Produce a Scene that starts focused outside the protagonists, and then enter the protagonists into the scene.<br/>
Jack of Clubs: Play this card when you are Producing and use a camera trick (black and white, long shot, etc.)<br/>
...and so on...                        </div>

                            Hey Ronaldo, you might well know this already, but if the only reason you didn't want to play Universalis was that you wanted each player to have a primary PC, it is in fact very easy to play Universalis that way.  If I remember correctly, it's actually one of the Rules Gimmicks suggested in the text itself.<br/><br/>But other than that, your Producerless PTA game sounds pretty cool.                        </div>

This is very elegant. How come I never have these ideas?<br/><br/>My D10 gives an average result of 2 per roll amd I figured something around 1.8 would be ideal. 2D6 gives just over 1.5 so I think it would work fine.<br/><br/>5th Child - I am aware of that rule. It was not quite what I was looking for. Thank you for the pointer, though.<br/><br/>RS - I am going to have to think about your suggestion of the hand of cards.                        </div>

                            Yeah, the hand of cards thing is a big shift from standard PTA play.<br/>
<br/>
As for those face cards, you could do a lot with that, like have players actually adding stuff to the chart based on what they see - <br/>
<br/>
i.e. "Play when you draw a diagram of the scene"<br/>
"Play when you narrate someone breaking an object"                        </div>

                            I am not sure how to balance the hand of cards. Other concerns include the fact that black cards don't help you win a conflict and low value black cards have no value whatsoever (maybe to bid for scenes you don't really care.<br/><br/>It almost feels like Universalis is the closer game for what you want and you could build from it instead of from PTA.                        </div>

                            I think you're right Ronaldo.  I think I should be looking at Universalis rules gimmicks to make Uni play more like PTA, or maybe just play Uni with irrevocable PCs and a Pitch Meeting at the beginning.                        </div>

                            I think that would be a very cool use of Universalis that is likely achievable with a variety of gimmicks/tenets.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who already approaches creating Universalis scenes as if I was visualizing a shot in a TV show or movie.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>
