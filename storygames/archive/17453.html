It did cause some entertainment when she did it first and gained her a string by disgusting her Choosen boyfriend during sex.<br/>Then later she became her darkest self again after a hex and the person she hurt the most was a vampire, who later died without her being able to offer peace. So it would have been possible for her to be her darkest self forever. We let her get out of it by wishing the dead enemy to rest in peace and really mean it. But otherwise she would have to hurt someone more first and then offer peace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395252/#Comment_395252" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T08:34:13+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  8:34AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!

The Fae option I didn't have to try, but I agree with the advice that it seems quite a vague darkness. The Mortal when played it went dark near game end and it was largely meltdown time. It fitted with the one shot format we were playing but I'm not sure how it would sit with happening as part of a multi-session game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395278/#Comment_395278" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T11:30:39+00:00" title="October 29, 2012 11:30AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Darkest Self was fun enough in my game.
