I've been fiddling with the magic and secrets and such and I'm going to post some of my stuff here.  I'd love any advice people have and any help in fleshing out some of the Abilities, Secrets and Keys that might be very appropriate for this setting.  Here are some specific things I'd love help with...<br/><br/>1.)  Racial Secrets and Keys.  I'd like the Elves, Dwarves and Goblins to be more distinct.  I don't want them to just be humans with pointy ears or short, grumpy humans.  Any crunchy bits attached to the different races would be uber-cool.<br/><br/>2.)  Cerilia is very driven by religion.  Crunchy bits related to religion would be awesome.<br/><br/>3.)  Any shortcomings with my current work.  Please, point broken stuff out.<br/><br/>Here's what I have thus far.  I'll post more as I add more.  <br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Shadow of Cerilia</span></b><br/><br/>This is an adaption of The Shadow of Yesterday rules to the Birthright campaign setting.  At this point I am not trying to develop any sort of nation vs nation meta-game that was included in the orginal Birthright game.  Instead, I'm just taking the character and story elements and porting them to the new ruleset.  I hope you enjoy it.<br/><br/><b>New Abilities</b>:  <br/><br/><b>Magical Abilities</b>:  All magical abilities have the following characteristics if they apply.  They general characteristics can be altered by Secrets.\n<ul><li>Duration - 10 minutes (or instantaneous)<br/></li><li>Range - Personal / Reach<br/></li><li>Targets - 1 target creature or  thing<br/></li><li>Amount / Size - 5 pounds or a fist sized object, whichever is smaller or appropriate<br/></li></ul>\n<b>Evocation</b>(v):  The act of creating something from nothing.  This is generally done with things like fire and water but can also be used to create more complex items like swords or bows, it's just harder to do (ie requires special Secrets).  With a rolled success, the character may produce a small amount of a common material or energy.  Common things produced are rock, fire, water, light, ice, and darkness.<br/><br/><b>Transmutation</b>(v): The act of changing something from one state or being to another (ie turning people into toads).  With a successful roll, the character may move a single Pool point from one Pool to another.  He could move one of his Reason points over to Vigor, for instance.  This lasts for the regular duration or until the point is used.  Depleted Pool points cannot be moved.<br/><br/><b>Abjuration</b>(i):  Protection spells.  The character can form a circle on the ground (or other surface) that surrounds himself and embue it with magical power.  If a successful roll is made, the character gets a bonus die to resist any Vigor damage while he remains in the circle.<br/><br/><b>Conjuration</b>(i):  Moving something (or someone) from over there to over here.  The conjurer can summon a small animal or object of no more than 5 pounds to his location.  At the end of the spell the object is returned to its original location.<br/><br/><b>Divination</b>(r):  Learn secrets long forgotten. Predict the future. Find hidden things. Foil deceptive spells.  The character can scry on someone if he has a bit of mirror or a still pool of water.  If the object of the scrying has no protection and doesn't know they are being scryed upon then a simple successful roll is required.  If the object is protected or attempting to avoid detection then an opposed roll against the appropriate ability is rolled.<br/><br/><b>Necromancy</b>(v):  Deals with the forces of life and death from raising the dead to creating undead.  The character can talk to a recently dead corpse.  A successful roll indicates that the character successfully communicates with the dead being.  This ability does not grant the user the ability to speak the dead being's language if they could not do so before.<br/><br/><b>Enchantment</b>(r):  Mind affecting spells.  With a successful roll the character may add a bonus die to his next social roll.<br/><br/><b>Illusion</b>(r): Spells to deceive the senses of others.  With a successful roll the character may create a minor illusion that affects one sense of any observers in the area.  If can be smell, hearing, sight, taste or touch.  The caster must create the illusion within arms reach of himself; however sound or smell can travel a very short distance from the origin of the spell.<br/><br/><b>New Secrets:</b><br/><br/><b>Secret of the Blooded </b>- You are one of the Blooded Scions of Cerilia.  This doesn't mean that you actually rule anything, it just means you could.  Some of the power of the gods that died has been passed down to you.  You now open up a 4th Pool called "Blood".  It starts at a value of 1.  From this point your Blood pool can be advanced as normal, except that each point costs double what a regular Pool point would cost.  Blood points can be spent on any roll, in addition to a point from a regular Pool.  There are also Secrets that require Blood Pool points to activiate.  You must take this Secret at character creation or have someone "Invest" their Blood strength into you.  Inventment is discussed in The Secret of Inventment.<br/><br/><b>Secret of Investment </b>- You know how to transfer your Blood Pool to another character.  Simply designate which character you are investing.  That character then gets a Blood Pool equal to half your Pool rounded down.  The character also gets Secret of the Blooded.  Your character loses all his Blood Pool permenantly and loses the Secret of the Blooded.  <b>Activation</b>: 1 Blood  <b>Required</b>: Secret of the Blooded.  <br/><br/><b>Secret of Blood Theft </b>- You know how to steal another's Blood strength.  By using a special weapon made of Bloodsteel and piercing your victim's heart, killing them in the process obviously, you can add 1 to your Blood Pool.  <b>Activation</b>: 1 Blood and 1 Vigor.  <b>Required</b>: Secret of the Blooded.  <br/><br/><b>Magical Secrets</b>:<br/><br/><b>Secret of Realm Magic </b>- You know how to use your magic over great distances using Ley Lines.  From the terminus of any Ley Line you are attuned with you may cast a spell and have it's affect take place at any other terminus of the Ley Line.  <b>Activation</b>: 1 Blood + cost of Spell.  <b>Required</b>: Secret of the Blooded.<br/><br/><b>Fire Blast </b>- Waves of heat and flame roll from the caster's outstretched hand towards his foes.  The player specifies any group of targets within line of sight of his character.  After rolling his Evocation, success levels are dealt out as Harm to that group however the person playing the group sees fit.  <b>Activation</b>: 2 Vigor  <b>Required</b>: Evocation<br/><br/><b>Azrai's Despair </b>- All those who oppose your will are crippled with hopelessness and depression.  If cast from a Ley Line terminus the spell can affect an entire province-sized area.  If cast anywhere else, it affects all those within line of sight.  The caster rolls his Enchantment and records his success level.  All his enemies within the area of effect must roll their Resist when taking any actions against him.  If their roll beats the caster's Enchantment roll, there is no effect.  If the Enchantment roll is higher, the caster's enemy has the difference in SL as penalty dice for all actions taken against the caster.  The spell lasts until the next sunrise.  <b>Activation</b>: 2 Reason + 2 Blood  <b>Required</b>: Secret of Realm Magic, Enchantment                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83507/#Comment_83507" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T13:38:17+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  1:38PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I so want to help, yet I know so little about Birthright...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83527/#Comment_83527" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T15:08:52+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  3:08PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy,<br/><br/>Think D&amp;D with armies clashing, political infighting, and the rulers of the land wielding the power of dead gods (bloodlines).

You're basically requiring them to specialize (which I have no problems with, but don't expect any general casters).<br/><br/>Can you imagine a character Transcending with Evocation? If so, cool. If not, think about it a bit more.<br/><br/>How I'd do magic is like I did at GPSE - One Ability with Secrets that modify or enhance it.<br/><br/>e.g. Weave could be your generic magic Ability. Secret of Rory's Evocation School could give bonus dice when incinerating things. You wouldn't (and shouldn't) define all these secrets at once - explain a template and let the players decide where they got their magical enhancements from. This will give them buy-in and help populate the world. Also, you're creating a bookkeeping with the spell stats. I'd dump them. Why worry about magic's limitations when a successful Ability check gets you everything you wanted anyway?<br/><br/>Blood - I went back and forth with my Mana pool concept. By taking the Abilities away from being tied to it, you leave out tough questions like "What does Blood Harm mean? How do I heal Blood Harm?" etc. Here's the big question you've kept, though: How does one recharge a Blood Pool? Make sure it involves roleplaying with a PC or NPC.<br/><br/>I see that you're following the Feat format of requirements for Secrets. This can be good to possibly keep that D&amp;D feel. Just don't let other secrets 'outweigh' the secrets with the requirements, or the players will feel gypped. Don't think they aren't going to tear apart your system for weaknesses.<br/><br/>Keep it coming! I think the more you play TSOY with no mods the more you'll see what you do and don't need to mod rules-wise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86066/#Comment_86066" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T08:14:45+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  8:14AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I redid the magical abilities a bit.

You can find it at <a href="http://shadowofcerilia.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">The Shadow of Cerilia</a>.<br/><br/>I do need to think on how to refresh Blood.  Any suggestions would be very appreciated.  I'm not going to worry about Blood Harm, since I'm not making any Blood Abilities.  Blood Feats, yes, but not any Blood Abilities.  This means there aren't any abilities that do Blood Harm.<br/><br/>I've got a couple of players who are interested in playing so I'm going to give the system a run and see how it works out in practice.
