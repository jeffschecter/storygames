I'll start by throwing a few things out there.<br/><br/>For my part, I'm really interested using an otherkind dice system, modified to take into account the minifigure that the players have built to represent their character.<br/><br/>As for range and movement, I'm thinking about using in the three scales: microscale, heroica scale, and minifigure scale as a determining factor, and using a range/movement dice as part of the otherkind dice mechanic (as Vincent did in the original otherkind game.)<br/><br/>Something like this, at microscale hand-thrown weapons can't be used and only powered missile weapons (e.g. bows) can be used.  At a heroica scale, hand-thrown weapons can be thrown into an adjacent "hex" and powered missle weapon can be used against anything that can be seen.  The dice roll is to determine whether you can get close enough.

To wit:<br/><b>1)</b> Play occurs on turns in and out of combat, but you can seize the turn (react) flexibly. Sort of like <i>Dead of Night</i>, if that's familiar, except we construe all action, whether dramatic or combat-y, in sequential terms.<br/><b>2)</b> Character actions are resolved by simple fiat comparison of character states; uncertainty and dice come into the picture in that those states are established by dice. This means that "I have the upper hand" is a generic state that is diced for, while "I hit him and then run away" is merely a simple action declaration made possible by prior state development. Similar to <i>Amber</i>, which also resolves conflicts with comparison of semi-static character states.<br/><br/>I'm pretty confident of this arrangement for minis drama play for various reasons. One of the big ones is that it gets out of the task resolution thicket (no mean feat for a minis game) and comfortably into conflict resolution space <i>without</i> obviating the need to move minis around and have them interact with each other. I also feel that play-like interactions with toys are more natural when all participants have a priori knowledge of what the goal of the interaction is. For example, if you're doing a sword duel with toys, it's much easier to do the play-acting part if you know a priori that currently character A has a '3' while character B has a '5' for their effectiveness/protagonism score, and therefore B is going to lead and A is going to lose. As long as A is not willing to risk trying to change those numbers (in itself potentially much more dangerous than merely losing the fight), we can just play-act the fight choreography, however much of it seems dramaturgically proper, and then wind it down with B's victory whenever. Or, A can decide due to the fictional detail to take the risk and try to change the duel state before the process finishes.<br/><br/>Note that a top-down conflict resolution system also means that things like weapon ranges, movements rates and such become much, much less important for player effectiveness. I feel that this is a good idea for a dramatic story game played with toys. If your definition for a single turn is "one dramatic action", and your definition for initiative is "whomever's action would be the most exciting now", I feel that this makes for a solid chassis for further development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460999/#Comment_460999" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-08T13:41:42+00:00" title="March  8, 2017  1:41PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm always both fascinated with the description Eero gives of his game, but then mystified at how it works in practice.<br/><br/>I'm going to go a bit out of order on comments, mostly because I think I'm largely on the same page as Eero with regard to his conclusion:\n<blockquote>Note that a top-down conflict resolution system also means that things like weapon ranges, movements rates and such become much, much less important for player effectiveness. I feel that this is a good idea for a dramatic story game played with toys.

Let's run with this, because it gets to the next two important bits: <i>One Dramatic Action </i>and <i>Action That would Be Most Exciting Now</i>.<br/><br/>If I understand correctly, it's very important for a GM to be present to clarify and officialize this stuff, based on what character-players are describing.<br/><br/>If I understand correctly, the GM sets the scene, peoples it with NPCs, and gives players rough indications of how/where they are in the scene. This of course is paralleled with layout of the toys.<br/><br/>The GM then broadly asks the players what their characters are up to. Each player then gives their One Dramatic Action, with the GM acting as something of a safe-guard on whether their One Dramatic Action is too big/too encompassing for what is going on compared to what other characters are doing, and then also determines the order of resolution based on What is most interesting right now.<br/><br/>This then flows and cycles until the scene is complete.<br/><br/>Also, if I understand correctly, this makes the range/movement issue more flexible, because the GM can stretch or compress things as needed as the definition of a turn is not X seconds/minutes but <i>One Dramatic Action</i>. How much time/space One Dramatic Action involves is relative to what is going on and what other characters are doing., and can feasibly flex throughout a scene.<br/><br/>Generally though, it is a bit "lumpier" than moment by moment actions, and there needs to be some kind of goal stated beyond simply "I shoot that dude".<br/><br/>Am I pretty close on this Eero?<br/><br/>Also, do you find that things become more fine-grained as action adventure type sequences begin, if they've evolved from a more chatting/exploring type situation? How do you handle that?<br/><br/>I am however confused by the Amber comparison, partly because I don't have very much knowledge of the game, and it's all second-hand.<br/><br/>As I understand it, Amber characters all have varying specialties, and if they have the highest value ( or a higher value) in a stat, they simply win versus someone with a lower value, unless that lower value character can somehow even the odds.<br/><br/>I'm not clear how that works in your system, although I can imagine a system where there are only really three possible match ups between characters ( and this would use dice unlike Amber, as I imagine it anyway).<br/><br/>1) The acting character badly outclasses the opposing character(s) through any combination  of inherent abilities, genre conventions, gear, and described preparations.<br/><br/>2) There's a rough parity between the characters in the situation because of those factors.<br/><br/>3) The acting character is badly outclassed in the conflict because of those factors.<br/><br/>I could imagine a very simple dice roll for conflict system based on that, producing a smallish range of general outcomes that are interpreted based upon situation. And, of course, this too could be scalable and flexible, rather than based on some sort of universally applied stat range.<br/><br/><br/>Is there any chance that you, Eero, could describe a bit more of how your system works?<br/><br/>Perhaps, using an example, how it makes range/movement less relevant, but still involves toy play?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461005/#Comment_461005" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-08T15:09:09+00:00" title="March  8, 2017  3:09PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Am I pretty close on this Eero?</blockquote>\nIn the neighbourhood, but not quite. Perhaps I'll write up a simplified example of the play routine - I was trying to be succinct about the theoretical basis in the above post, so as to keep to generalities. This is something akin to what occurred in a playtest, and it's going to be annoyingly long:<br/><br/><i>Five heroes enter a seedy tavern; four of them are player characters, while one is the GMPC Sipi Sormivaltti, the footloose "hero" of the game. They are here to look for clues to the whereabouts of the Devil, who had earlier cheated Sipi Sormivaltti to give up his shadow. There are several patrons in the tavern, including two sea captains, plus some service staff.</i><br/><br/>The GM sets up the scene with the toys. The players each sit around the table with the GM. Because it is a new scene, the "initiative" to act is with the GM first. This "initiative" really just means that we will constructively assume that an opportunity for dramatic action (that is, action that furthers the story) is on the GM first.<br/><br/>So let's say that the GM opts to let Sipi Sormivaltti act here - he's only getting one action, but he can choose which of the not-PCs in the scene takes it. As you might or might not remember from when I described this game earlier, Sipi is a picaresque anti-hero with a knack for making friends with powerful people - the player characters are all his companions who've promised to help him with his troubles.<br/><br/>The GM could in principle have Sipi do something mechanically meaningful, but that's not in character (his concept is pretty much that he is useless when it comes to practically achieving something), so instead he opts to merely set up for later moves: he moves Sipi Sormivaltti the toy into the tavern, describes how haughty and annoying Sipi is, and gets him up close to the barkeep - Sipi threatens him and tries to ineffectually bully him into telling him where the Devil went after their cardgame last night.<br/><br/>After this action the initiative moves clockwise to the next player at the table, whoever happens to sit next to the GM. Let's call him player A. The initiative means that we constructively assume that the situation has developed in such a way that his character now has an opportunity to contribute in an useful manner. The GM can often frame this in a more specific way. For example: "You are all surprised by Sipi's brash - and frankly stupid - actions on his return to the scene of the crime. You, player A, are the first to recover from your astonishment. Do you wish to take this opportunity to act?"<br/><br/>Now, player A gets to act. Because he's not the GM, he actually has an agenda in this scene aside from stirring the pot. (Sipi Sormivaltti as a GMNPC basically exists merely to create interactions and complications; it was never the point that he would actually obviate the need for the PCs to act.) Player A probably wants to restrain Sipi Sormivaltti - let's say his character is somebody who would do that.<br/><br/>"Do I need to roll for that?" he asks. The GM averts that - Sipi Sormivaltti is not actually antagonistic, it's a mere color action to go up, apologize to the barkeep and drag Sipi off him. This action does not further much, but it helps prevent social blowback a bit later.<br/><br/>Player A is not quite satisfied, though - he feels that if he's not rolling, he's evidently not doing anything really substantial. Thus, "Hey, could I also get the barkeep to tell us what he knows?" The GM allows this, because it is still one dramatic action, really; the players just describe how the character tries to smooth things out and get an answer to the simple question.<br/><br/>This time the GM states that there is resistance: Sipi Sormivaltti offended the barkeep, so it's not a given that he'll cooperate. The player needs to have a die on the table to accomplish this.<br/><br/>The principle rule here is that characters may or may not have dice accompanying them on the table - this is the mechanical "weight" of a character in the current situation. Characters with dice on the table are better able to get their way, but they are also more vulnerable to mechanical consequences from other characters.<br/><br/>So player A rolls a d6 and gets a '4' on his die. He puts the die next to his toy on the table so everybody can see what sort of mechanical weight he's rocking now. The dice could also be kept in front of the player, but I feel that this would require a placemat of some sort as well to keep things orderly.<br/><br/>(I'll skip the issue of where the dice come from - technically characters express various traits of their own, or the scene environment, to manifest dice. Not important for the big picture, though, and not intended as a serious constraint so much as an opportunity to expose character.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461006/#Comment_461006" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-08T15:09:24+00:00" title="March  8, 2017  3:09PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Now, with the die on the table, A can get his way against the barkeep. The GM would have the option to interrupt and have the barkeep roll as well, but it's not that important to the barkeep, so he lets it roll. A gets to lead in their further interaction, so if A chooses to intimidate he'll play the barkeep as meek, and if A chooses to talk nicely, the barkeep will be reasonable; the resolution has already been effected by the fact that there's a '4' against a 'zilch' on the table, so the actual theatrics will be informed by that.<br/><br/>The barkeep reveals to player A that the Devil left in the morning on a boat, intending to go to the Island of Perdition - an useless lump of rock out on the sea. Sipi Sormivaltti (as a non-action color detail) exclaims that he'll need to follow, and can anybody find him a ship.<br/><br/>Next the initiative moves to player B, to the left of player A in the seating order. The GM (or somebody else) may again characterize the shifting initiative in some way, but this is basically formalistic rules design: it's your turn now because you sit there, and we're inventing post-facto reasons for why particularly now is a good time for your character to act. Depends on the situation.<br/><br/>So player B decides to go talk with one of the sea captains in the tavern. He drags the rest of the timid party (really, just players lower on the initiative order) in the middle of the tavern in his wake. Rolls a die, too, because the first die is always pretty safe, and it makes things go quicker when you show some weight. He learns that this fellow is captain Reihelm, and he's an honest sea captain. Perhaps he would be willing to take the party to the Isle of Perdition, yes.<br/><br/>But, interrupt! The GM interrupts the action with the other sea captain. He rolls a die (mandatory to have dice on the table to interrupt, I think) introduces himself as captain Karppi, a nefarious seadog. He will underbid the honest captain Reihelm for the fare.<br/><br/>Now let's say that player B rolled a '1' for his on-table die just now, and when the GM interrupted, he rolled a '3' for captain Karppi. We might have a conflict here, so the numbers matter: because Karppi has a greater value on the dice, we know that he dominates the social exchange for now.<br/><br/>The GM says that this was his action: if the PCs do not contest Karppi's offer, Sipi Sormivaltti will choose it despite the blatant nefariousness of the captain, and off we go on his slave galley. In fact, the players need to act before the GM's next turn comes around, as that's when the deal's sealed - everybody potentially gets a chance to act before it, in other words. So there's a little bit of a time pressure here, too, but not much.<br/><br/>The next turn would be on player A again, because the GM's interruption gave him the turn and the turn always moves clockwise. This is by design in this game, though I am not sure yet if it's a good idea. Either way, the natural way for things to go is that the player to the left of the GM potentially gets a lot of turns by the virtue of the seating. There are ways to influence the seating order, though, so in a sense this is a way for the players to arrange themselves on the basis of energy level and story protagonism and such - let the most appropriate players take the center position, so to speak.<br/><br/>But let's say that player C, heretofore quiet, decides to react when he sees Sipi influenced by captain Karppi's attractive offer. He rolls in, gets a '2', and comes in shouting that he knows Karppi from before, and he's a dishonorable cur who cannot be trusted. We know that his die is lower than Karppi's '3', but it's by merely one point (a "small difference" as the rules term it), so he's still able to delay Karppi at the cost of losing his die and taking a "dint" (the mechanical term for a metaphorical wound in this game). He does just that, forcing captain Karppi into a long-winded yet glib explanation of how it's character C who's an untrustworthy person and how he is the real victim here.<br/><br/>(I'll skip explaining how injuries are dealt with, not relevant to the big picture. They're not really very dangerous in this game, more like what you'd expect of a Disney movie or something. Just momentary inconveniences and opportunities to depict determination and bravery.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461007/#Comment_461007" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-08T15:09:28+00:00" title="March  8, 2017  3:09PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Meanwhile, it's player D's turn, because C's interrupt again moved the initiative to that side of the table. D decides to go talk with some of the other people in the tavern in the hopes of learning something useful. He rolls a die as well for a '5', making him potentially quite effective later. The GM tells him about what some of the other patrons have to say about captain Karppi, as a back-handed way of justifying how D might come in a bit later into the captaincy debate; his '5' on the table means that everybody knows that he's got the strength to carry the debate as it stands right now.<br/><br/>After D it's the GM's turn again. He has options: he could call in one of the "twists" he's prepared for the scene as part of the game prep (as you might remember, this game is theoretically predicated as a railroaded princess play exercise: the GM's got a specific plotline, and the players aren't really fighting against it), but let's say for simplicity's sake that he'll merely let captain Karppi press on: he turns to Sipi Sormivaltti and personally entices him with promises of good accomodations on his ship.<br/><br/>The GM does not need to roll more dice for Karppi here if he doesn't want to, as Karppi already has that '3' on the table - as long as you have a die standing you can keep trying to do whatever it is that you're trying to do. Karppi was delayed by player C earlier, but now he's brushed away C's concerns and credibility. The GM decides to not roll a new die, as dice are pretty risky in this game by themselves - you don't want to roll a pair with your own dice, for instance, as that's an immediate fumble.<br/><br/>After the GM it would be player A's turn again, but let's say that player D was inspired by whatever narration the GM provided on his turn, and decides to act: his character comes into the debate, wielding some snippet of info he learned just now from the locals about the nefariousness of captain Karppi. In other words, D interrupts in reaction to Karppi's action.<br/><br/>No new dice are rolled by D, because he does not need any: his '5' beats Karppi's '3', so he's ascendant now. D describes how he convinces Sipi Sormivaltti to refuse the nefarious captain and go with the honest captain Reinhelm instead. Because he is overriding another character's action, he removes Karppi's '3' off the table and lowers his own die value of '5' by a single point to '4'. Karppi suffers a 'dint'.<br/><br/>Play continues on like that until the scene finishes when everybody has excited their characters. Perhaps the players want to talk with the sea captains some more, or intrigue among themselves, or find out more from the barkeep about Sipi's and Devil's cards tournament last night.<br/><br/>Hopefully I managed to illustrate those two points I mentioned earlier: play occurs in turns, and the characters have "effectiveness states" (the dice on the table) that show us moment-to-moment who should be leading the narrative play-action.\n<blockquote>Perhaps, using an example, how it makes range/movement less relevant, but still involves toy play?</blockquote>\nMy example didn't go into this much, but shortly: because turns are conceptualized in terms of dramatic, story-moving actions, the question of whether you can "reach" something or not does not really even enter into it except as a thing of common sense that does not <i>truly</i> matter so much that you'd want to argue about it with the other players. If another player thinks that a character should reach, then they do, and what do I care.<br/><br/>Rather, the way it works is that where you happen to be standing on the table mostly determines your ability to "react" to events: you can only seize initiative and react when you a) witness something occurring and b) have the means to do something about it and c) want to take the risk of doing something about it. So far I have not observed a need to introduce the concept of range into any of this because of the formalistic way the conflict resolution system works: the tactical configuration of who's where does not, generally speaking, have permanent and irreversible impact on what is going on. What matters much more is whether your character is willing to take the risk of rolling more dice into conflicts. The systemic cost of acting effectively is so much more important than reach that the latter issue generally fades elegantly into the background.<br/><br/>When you're not reacting, but rather are acting because the turn rolled around to you, the positioning question is even more foot-loose because of the active constructive presumption that the character is in position to act meaningfully. This may well mean that we'll say something like "while all that was happening, I was sneaking around to the other entrance, so I could jump in right now and influence the events" - in other words, a character piece outright jumps from one side of the table to the other if that's the only way to honor the subjective right of the player to have an opportunity for meaningful action on their turn. The initiative is much less about what order actions occur in, and much more about putting players on the spot with opportunities to act - the game never wants you to "whiff" in a minis gaming way by telling you that no, you can't actually do anything on your turn because you're out of range.<br/><br/>If all this seems like insanity, it's probably because you're interpreting it from a tactical perspective of action where action choreography details such as where you're standing actually have major impact on what happens. I am not convinced that this is ideal for "toy play" type of minis use, though; I haven't played this game much yet, but the signs are optimistic that the essential freedom of moving the toys pretty loosely, only constrained by the concept of going in turns and having to match your words with your dice, works well to encourage the players to use the toys in lively ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461009/#Comment_461009" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-08T15:56:01+00:00" title="March  8, 2017  3:56PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tell me about the seating order and how that's initially determined.<br/><br/>Does that ever become a problem for the group, or does it not matter because of the whole interrupt potential?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461010/#Comment_461010" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-08T16:14:49+00:00" title="March  8, 2017  4:14PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The initial seating order is arbitrary for now. The game hasn't had very much play due to how much work it is (compared to a game without an elaborate toy setup), so I wouldn't be surprised if this stuff changed with experience. For example, I could see the group sorting themselves in seating at the start of the second session, after familiarizing themselves with the game.<br/><br/>During the game the seating can change via two means: as a between-scenes action (these are narrative vignettes played without toys, mostly initiated by players) or as part of a "twist" event during a scene.<br/><br/>The former are basically short introductory snippets that suggest that a particular character might be particularly important to the next scene: for example, if the next scene is going to occur in the home of one of the characters, the player can say so, tell the other players something about how their character feels about that, and move in "front" (next to the GM) of the seating order.<br/><br/>The twists are surprise events that introduce new elements into a scene once it has started. For example, the entrance of new characters mid-scene is a twist. Each scene has a maximum number of twists depending on its size (basically, how large and detailed the GM's setpiece is), ranging from one to three; the premise is that twists make scenes longer, and you want to have the point of gravity in the story occur in the more elaborate setpieces, whence the conceit that more twists occur on bigger sets. (The GM of course preps the set size in accord with their plans for set importance, so bigger set = more important set for the story.)<br/><br/>Any player may theoretically introduce a twist during their turn, but for an action to count for a twist, it has to be one in a dramaturgical sense, and it is often the case that the GM has more opportunity for dramaturgical surprise than the other players. (Player characters can twist, though, if they put their minds to it: for example, changing allegiance via betrayal is quite likely a twist, as is revealing an important secret.)<br/><br/>The main mechanical effects of a twist are that it clears the dice off the table (itself quite important, and a way to even the odds when the situation develops against you) and lets the players rearrange their seating (presumably according to the wishes of whoever is doing the twisting). There might be something else as well, I'm not sure yet.<br/><br/>All in all, the seating order is semi-permanent: not that difficult to change if you want to sit "closer to the action" (which basically means to the left of either the GM or some other player with a penchant for seizing initiative regularly), but if everybody's happy with it, you can go the whole session without standing up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461022/#Comment_461022" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-08T21:12:03+00:00" title="March  8, 2017  9:12PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds very functional and workable, Eero.

I'm sort of hoping that the pressure of sitting on top of this gem will motivate said person to playtest it (which, with the miniatures and such, is a pretty big task).<br/><br/>The risk in dice-rolling is baked into the dice mechanics in that there's a rules principle that states that whenever two local dice (as in, dice involved in the same sequence of events on the table) have the same value, they "dint" each other. This goes for your own dice as well as anybody else's dice - two dice in the same battle-space are interpreted to mean that instead of elegant maneuvering for advantage, at <i>this</i> moment the conflict participants managed to actually hurt each other somehow. If you dint yourself, that's basically a fumble - they're pretty common by design in this system, come about as the result of over-exertion, and are treated equivalently to dints caused by enemy action. Same for friends: in this system it's very possible to rush into battle and just bump into an ally, making things worse in a pretty Disney-esque action sequence.<br/><br/>(This whole dinting thing requires you to conceptualize "domination" and "injury" as different things, because generally speaking you only injure your opponents by taking an injury yourself, when your dice dint each other. There's a certain protocol for a negotiatory end to that - one party may take take the dint and voluntarily spare the other - but the ideal, actual goal here is domination without injury: you don't want to dint yourself, you want to get a bigger die than the opponent so you can do things to them - e.g. capture them or force them to escape - without them having the power to resist you.)<br/><br/>Because you're allowed to <i>either</i> pull a die off the table or roll a die for your character on your turn, and because you can dint with enemies as well as friends, there's strong mechanical incentive for "getting out of the way" when something is happening on the table, and to spread out to deal with parallel issues without elbowing other actors accidentally, and to be conservative about rolling dice into play. Nothing particularly prevents characters from having e.g. two dice on the table at once (and this does actually allow you to make two "attacks" or similar related actions at once, on top of other advantages), but by doing so you increase your dint probability quite a bit: if any other participant in the same melee (or whatever, a social conflict works as well as in the example) decides to roll more dice, they start to have pretty good odds of dinting with you if you're rocking two or even three dice yourself.<br/><br/>The basic "combat strategy" that this system presumably produces is one where the players use the miniatures very much to position themselves, but the positioning occurs primarily in terms of "clashes" in the battle-space: you don't want to gang up on a single enemy too much to give your allies room to work with. You charge into combat with a dice roll, hoping for a good result, and in case you get it, you utilize your dominance to do things to your opponent. If you got a bad roll, you'll probably disengage when an opportunity arrives, withdraw that die you rolled, and then on a third action perhaps charge again, trying for a better roll. Up to the players how they'll play this, of course, and it's not supposed to be high tactical wargaming, of course; all this is in service of princess play Sim story gaming, as I've mentioned.<br/><br/>In case all this seems too gimped in terms of actually engaging in action adventure, remember that the genre of the game is acerbic fairy tale parody, pretty much, and that there is an advancement system that alleviates the inherent weaknesses of the dicing system for more powerful and competent characters. In general though, controlling your own dangerousness and being sensible about dealing with things is a big theme - all the player characters are "miracle companions" (well, those that aren't cursed companions or sage companions) who specifically have super-powers that <i>force</i> them to roll two or more dice at once when they use them, with the resultant likelihood of tragic self-dinting. Even then, I think that the game has its moments of simply heroic flow, as a good dice roll basically gives you free hand to dominate the situation: once you're showing a '6' it's basically your game until and unless somebody else evens the odds by dinting or twisting, and until then you get a pretty free hand to narrate how the situation develops. That "free wish fulfillment time" is basically what you shoot for in the conflict system, a chance for your character to do precisely what they can and want to. It could last for a single action, or for the rest of the scene, depending on how much other characters are willing to risk to contest your superior status.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461025/#Comment_461025" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-08T22:02:44+00:00" title="March  8, 2017 10:02PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To tell the truth, all this talking about my excellent story miniatures game makes me want to prop it up myself for a new round of playtest/refinement.

About the distance of one move if the situation is hairy and you're getting a bit movie slo-mo with things.<br/><br/>After that, you only really need to deal with truly long distance weapons or fire, and generally, even those are more likely to create a threatened zone that's dangerous to move or be in, rather than  direct threats. <br/><br/>Then it's a matter of deciding on terrain effects, cover and concealment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461053/#Comment_461053" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-09T21:06:18+00:00" title="March  9, 2017  9:06PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I would want to handle ranges as a game feature, rather than something we measure in physical space. In other words, accept the idea that the figures and spaces are all abstract representations - space, time, scale, and so forth are malleable.<br/><br/>Instead of positioning the minis and measuring distances, I'd want to build a ruleset where various ranges have different repercussions on combat. <br/><br/>What would that look like?<br/><br/>For example, let's take something like "grappling range". This means two combatants are intimately close.<br/><br/>To achieve "grappling range", you'd have to make a move to establish it as such (within the constraints of the game rules). For instance, moving to grappling range might require surprising the opponent (catching them off guard, from behind, etc) or exposing yourself to an attack from the opponent. If your character can avoid or survive that attack, then you can move into "grappling range".<br/><br/>The position would have effects, as well. Attacking an opponent with a small, maneuverable weapon might deal double damage, for instance, and attacking with a "normal" weapon suffers a severe penalty. If either of you is the target of another character's attack (from the outside), there's chance the other character gets hit. Biting attacks become possible. And so on.<br/><br/>Another example of such a rule might be like this: <br/><br/>When two characters face off, the one with initiative can pick the range bracket that they engage each other in. However, either character can veto any range bracket that is closer than the reach of their current weapon. (So, you can't choose to go to "close" range with a person with a spear, unless they let you.)<br/><br/>This means that we a) know what we need to do to get into a particular range bracket/situation, and, once there, b) each range bracket/situation has a specific set of consequences for our play.<br/><br/>With rules like those, you don't need to measure distances, ever. Instead, you are free to position the miniatures dynamically and in a way which "looks cool" or is inspiring to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461072/#Comment_461072" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-10T15:03:23+00:00" title="March 10, 2017  3:03PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In practice, when I've done stuff like this before, I pretty much just used mechanical tools as tools for "enhanced play".<br/><br/>And here I mean play like <i>play</i>.<br/><br/>Essentially I just used Mythic GM Emulator, and just the core bits of that.<br/><br/>There effectively were no hard and fast rules, which it seems like folks are looking for here.<br/><br/>The really successful game did have two of us who'd understood the concept of <i>Say Yes, or Roll the dice</i> and who'd encountered stuff like Archipelago before. <br/> Essentially it was GM-less, but with "soft" veto power, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>And truthfully, neither of us were much interested in breaking play by over stressing the tools.<br/><br/>To explain, I'll use a couple of examples that Eero and Paul posted.<br/><br/>In Paul's combat examples, closing to grapple range would have been simply stated by one of the players as something one of the characters was attempting. If there's no disagreement on that, they close to grapple range. If here is disagreement, voice other outcomes and ask for a die roll on the resolution chart, and interpret results. r, really, any of the stuff about weapon reach and so on.<br/><br/>And in a way, it was also like Eero's example of taking One Dramatic Action. Say what the character is doing. If there's some minor disagreement between players about the fiction, use either the Archipelago standardized questions or a variant, or ask for a roll.<br/><br/>A "soft" veto could also just be one player telling another, hold up, you're dong a whole lot more there than every other character. Stuff could happen in between, so basically, describe somewhat smaller chunks of action. Usually, that just meant to set up intent, but not immediately assess outcome. You know, take turns.<br/><br/>Now, I do think that two things helped with this loosey-goosey ( with a couple tools) method:<br/><br/>1) We got into kids playing with toy mindset<br/><br/>2) We were pretty committed to avoiding the childhood clashes that stop play, and instead turning those situations over to the tools to resolve<br/><br/>3) We were also committed to letting the results take things where ever they went ( or suggested) without a whole lot of ego involved on whether it was good or bad for the individual characters and possibly straight up glorying in the weird spin out directions it produced. So I guess more like Author or Director stance, with not nearly as much Actor Stance?<br/><br/>4) I guess in some way, we also had a little bit of inherent shared ideas about what should or should not be done. So Big Bads didn't get whacked by single shots ( generally. I did come up once that an expert marksman managed to take down a T-Rex in rather do-or-die circumstances). Likewise, we just inherently accepted the fiction implied by the terrain toys. Of course it takes longer to walk through a boggy, swampy area! So we never really tried to show characters doing a mad dash that negated the swamp.<br/><br/>5) There was still Challenge, but it was more Author stance/level Challenge, and not character level/ actor stance challenge. It was more like: can you show a certain love of the fiction and bring the other player in on it for shared experience. Are you creative enough, quickly enough, to tie all of this stuff together. That kind of thing.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461076/#Comment_461076" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-10T18:13:26+00:00" title="March 10, 2017  6:13PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure; I'd think purely freeform collaborative storytelling is a great match for "playing with minis" (and possibly the most natural thing to do).<br/><br/>Like I wrote in the other thread, I would want the primary use of minis in such a game be as oracles or visual inspiration - picking sets and characters at semi-random to create settings, scenes, and situations, and using visual details of the minis to draw out narrative detail in the story (for example, asking about the history or meaning of various details of each mini or set - "where did Jebus get that yellow hat?

Not that there's anything wrong with that, but can we honestly say that it's better to do that with miniatures than cards, like <i>Everway</i> does? Perhaps for some, but surely it's a relatively small minority?<br/><br/>For this reason I find it imperative that the miniatures actually do something for the play experience by being <i>miniatures</i>, and not merely by being pretty. This "something" can be very instinctive and ephemeral, like aesthetic appreciation is, but it nevertheless needs to be specific to the form to justify that form.<br/><br/>For example, the basic use for miniatures is as game tokens that store position information. Another common use is as an "antropomorfized mouthpiece" when you pick one up and waggle it to signify that you're talking in-character. Cards are ill-suited for the former, while they actually could do the latter - now I want to start thinking about a GM deck of NPC cards to use in introducing and identifying NPCs to the players...<br/><br/>Probably the positioning thing is pretty much it for miniatures, in fact: everything else that they do, it seems I can think of examples of things that do them better. Maybe minis combine some features in a way that alternatives don't, but mostly it's all about the positioning thing: make your game into one that derives joy from (some sort of) complex positioning, and miniatures will have a place in it.<br/><br/>Not that this is on topic, anyway.

I have gone through various phases where I used counters instead of miniutures...<br/><br/>This relates back to my struggle to make sense of using LEGO in gaming. If the game itself doesn't somehow use LEGO in such a way that LEGO has a real advantage in its use, then we're just using LEGO because somehow it's cool (which ultimately has value, but may be a hard sell for a game).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461088/#Comment_461088" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-11T02:21:27+00:00" title="March 11, 2017  2:21AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make the peices you use to build your character actually have meaning in the play-mechanics as well.

Going further ( and I think at least as important) that stuff becomes basis for the fiction ( or at least initial inspiration).<br/><br/>For me personally, I'm not sure there really needs to be hard and fast rules for the stuff initially. I prefer tools to handle any interplayer disagreements about the stuff as they occur.<br/><br/>The approach to a gaming miniature and a Lego minifig are only slightly different. With the gaming miniature, you'd choose the pieces from  whatever overall collection was available, and go from there. If bits of gear needed to be emphasized, you'd talk about it and use it as a basis for the character's creation and capabilities as you choose and then build further on the non-physical-appearance inspired character of the miniature. With the Lego minifig, you have some more ability to build from the ground up using different parts, but the same general concept applies.<br/><br/>As for not needing particular rules...I've played games like Archipelago, and Fiasco, and Microscope, and even Mythic GM Emulator. All games where you really don't have to go into any mechanical measurements of characters, and they work fine. I think the same approach can work easily with minis.<br/><br/>As for some of the urge to formalize those fiction-meets-physical interactions and concerns about them, my mind drifts to Archipelago's Ritual phrases: That might not be so easy,  More detail please, Do it differently please. They're all forms of player chosen interrupt tools and soft vetoes. I think those general concepts can be applied to minis and terrain fairly easily in some form. They're notable in that no one ever has to use them, but they're there if you need them. Over time, play and precedent starts to morph into expectation of how play works for a given group.<br/><br/>So, if my character has been described as sneaky, and he has a dagger on him, and wants to sneak up and shank a guard with a chain shirt and spear and shield, I don't feel we really need any hard, premade rules for that. It only matters if one of the other players decides that any part of the description doesn't match their view of the fiction and decides to call it out. At that point, we go to ritual phrases or other tools ( maybe dice, maybe Archipelago/ Itras By cards). If I describe ( and show with the toys) Bonzo the Barbarian with his dagger sneaking up( and use the terrain to show and justify this part as well) and shanking the guard, and no one else finds that a problem, we're good to go. If anyone thinks they need to voice a soft veto ritual phrase, for any justifiable reason, we've got that as well.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461093/#Comment_461093" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-11T14:25:01+00:00" title="March 11, 2017  2:25PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for some of the questions about what exactly do minis do, what's their advantage or draw, if I can find it, I'll post a link to an old Greg Stoelze article where he talks about physical toy quality in relation to the boardgame Axis &amp; Allies.<br/><br/>The quick synopsis though, is this. Axis&amp;Allies was first published as a small company boardgame, with just plain brownish maps and cardbard counters. It was an okay game. Later on it was picked up and published by Milton Bradley and the game was upgraded to have physical, small plastic pieces representing the military units, shaped like, well, little toys and nicer, more colorful maps. It's popularity shot through the roof, and it wasn't just because of the bigger company with more connections. Notably, the rules hadn't been changed at all.<br/><br/>I think that, sometimes, at a site where we talk about games that are so often played bereft of much in the way of physical components that we overlook the importance of the things in themselves. Our games tend to be mostly verbal, or have a few books or sheets, and maybe some dice. We come to consider that normal, if not superior. In doing so though, we forget about the aesthetics of other things, like boardgames, where aesthetics can be a huge part of the appeal, as much as anything the game offers in terms of mechanical play value. At the same time, we over look our own aesthetic biases. Why do we name characters or describe their appearance or come up with personalities for them? Is it even necessary in something like old dungeon crawl centered D&amp;D and the like? Probably not, but it definitely makes the thing more fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461094/#Comment_461094" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-11T14:38:35+00:00" title="March 11, 2017  2:38PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, about the Oracles concept.<br/><br/>I've been looking into that again, now that folks have been talking about it.

I'd tend to use it for a specific style of minis play though, one involving some sort of big table set up, a "vision" and a pool of possible minis for characters. Since I already have a large pool of painted up Reaper Bones KS minis and a printed out fantasy city that I'd been envisioning along the lines of Sanctuary from Thieves' World, this might be fairly easy to do.<br/><br/>Not sure how the Lego folks would approach the same thing, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
