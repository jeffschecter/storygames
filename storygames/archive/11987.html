I already see it with a lot of traditional gaming, and even more so with certain kinds of story-games ( where the identification-fun seems even more pronounced).<br/><br/>Basically, I like Stephen King's Childhood Ant Farm style gaming, and I don't see too much of that designwise. And, since that's a pretty obscure reference, SKCAF gaming is named (by me) for an old Far Side cartoon titled something pretty close to that. Since I can't find a copy of the cartoon online anywhere, the rub of it is that a young Stephen King is peering at his ant farm where he's put a cutout of a picnicking family at the surface level as ants are emerging up to the top level.<br/><br/>That's how I like my gaming. I don't particularly want to feel some first person emotions or even get into a character's specific mind set. I want to be able to create some quirky and/or appropriate characters and put them in a bizarro situation and see where it goes. And I want, as a participant, to be able to manipulate whatever fictional stuff is necessary to do that, not just a single character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268050/#Comment_268050" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T08:56:50+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  8:56AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.

In that design, he very consciously embraces many aspects of the "traditional" GM/player divide and takes them on to the max. For instance, the players don't/can't apply any rules knowledge to manipulate their odds of success--they can only interact with the game by having their characters do stuff in the fiction. They also don't get to decide much about their characters--for instance, saying, "My character's mother died a few years ago" would be controversial. However, Delve does NOT place the "story" solely in the hands of the GM (although it lies pretty heavily there), so it may not qualify on your meter in that respect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268056/#Comment_268056" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T09:26:59+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  9:26AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Putting story solely in the hands of the GM is a pretty big one; it might not be tractable short of just writing and directing a stage production (which might be a worthwhile way to approach it too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268121/#Comment_268121" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T12:51:13+00:00" title="April 21, 2010 12:51PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2010 1:01PM by Big_J_Money.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/>The funny thing is, in that quote, I was really trying to get at was that I like games where the GM/Player thing is broken down, and that I enjoy some seperation between player and character.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>That's how I like my gaming.

So I think in my 'little idea', you would probably only want to play as GM.  For a guy like you (from what I'm reading) it wouldn't be particularly different to play versus a trad. game, except that the other players would be clued in by the game instructional text as to what you (the GM) are trying to get out of the game and how it facilitates; and vice-versa.<br/><br/>I guess the point of the exercise would be to grab some systems that are known to be strong or well loved trad. systems and to flake off and refit any rules that don't fit this design paradigm.  I guess those of you who have more experience in RPGs might say that this has been already done for years through role-playing conventions and habits, but this would be a more deliberate attempt at writing an actual text experiment.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>Putting story solely in the hands of the GM is a pretty big one; it might not be tractable short of just writing and directing a stage production (which might be a worthwhile way to approach it too.)</blockquote>\nI disagree, only because I've had a player tell me bluntly that they think my job as the GM is to make the story and present it to them, while their job is to "just play" it.  I haven't gotten into deep discussions about what is meant by "just play", but I've played with them long enough to have a gut feel for it.  Of course, like I said we don't play much any more because I'm not sure I agree with them; but this exercise would be an attempt to see if it can work for me -- if it's intentional from the beginning.  I've kinda sorta asked around once about this on the Forge, and komradebob's comment here just recently brought me back to it.<br/><br/>And so Hans definitely isn't being cheeky.  I think this may be the way people have successfully played trad. RPGs, but I never was really a part of that crowd.  The games I GMed or played in only ever really felt half realized.  Or maybe they were fully functional, but only ever as a form of comedy entertainment.  Yet, any attempt to break away from the trad. games on my part seems to lead my friends to: "No, you're the GM and you make the Setting and the whole Story and plot for the group, but we get to choose whatever our characters do."  We did play Universalis once, but the concensus (except from me) was "this is fun, but it's not a role-playing game."<br/><br/>I still might not be making sense though.  So I'll add, this would be a game that kind of is two games in one.  In one game you have system focused on generating character-play in ways that have been fruitful for players in the past.  In another game you have more of a focus on story-play in ways that have been fruitful for players in the past.  You need to find one dude who says "I want to play the second gae", and everyone else who says "I want to play the second."  And yeah, anyone could be totally reasoned in saying that this is a pointless idea, because you know a lot more about the history of these games than I do.  So I'm definitely asking from an position of curious ignorance.  I hope nobody minds that I am taking advantage of the 'little' in the 'Little Ideas' thread setting. :-)<br/><br/>Paul, I'll hunt around for Delve, that's very interesting.  If nothing else, I'd like to get input on what some of the folks I've played D&amp;D with think about it.<br/><br/>-- John M.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268128/#Comment_268128" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T13:09:05+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  1:09PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect that searching for "The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast" at the Forge will lead to some conclusions about this topic.<br/><br/>Aside from that, <i>Dread</i> is a pretty stark example of this thing being taken to a logical conclusion. The only think it's missing is adversiality - the GM isn't really trying to get to the story over the dead bodies of the players, but rather he simply has all the tools while the player role is only to experience the events, and this then results in a functional way for the GM to tell the story while the players "just play".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268183/#Comment_268183" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T16:28:19+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  4:28PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I about the only thing I've heard of that comes clsoe to what I <i>think</i> you're talking about are various shots people have taken at ad-hoc game design, or the sorts of things Professor Barker does with his personal Tekumel campaign ( as I've gleened from some 2nd and 3rd hand stories).<br/><br/>In those cases ( including my own forays into some ad-hoc gaming), the GM tends to use some sort of very basic die-rollling system, with the results being mostly circumstance-dependant on what die results mean. Generally, again IME, this tends to be a simple High roll good/low roll bad, with how good or how bad being determined by the situation. Slightly more advanced forms might include some foreshadowing of possible bad outcomes which the character would be able to assess prior to the roll.<br/><br/>IME, this sort of thing tends to work pretty much fine in a relatively high trust environment. It also seems like a fair number of people played in at some point in a similar way to judge from the "it was more fun when we played wrong" thread on the current front page.<br/><br/>Going along with that general concept, characters seem to be described much more basically, at least initially, perhaps not having much in the way of stats at all.<br/><br/>It does seem like these sorts of systems eventually grow in complexity upon regular replay, especially after players have gotten ahold of "proper" rpg rules.<br/><br/>My personal feeling about why this form didn't end up more popular has mostly to do with the difficulty in turning this approach into a commodity. I mean, there's nothing there to really sell anyone, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>(Despite that, I've considered how one might go about doing just that on many occasions)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268187/#Comment_268187" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T16:40:14+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  4:40PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, you might be looking for Mark Hughes' excellent Six Word RPG.

Another game I actually like to point to is Riddle of Steel.  (Ignoring the optional "Dramatic editing" rules from Drama points introduced later.)  Yes, there is explicit flagging, which might be too much for some players.  But here's the thing\u2014it's all in-character.  It's what your character believes, loves, hates, and wants (and is Destined to do or be, that one's a bit more problematic from the "no-meta" point of view I'll admit, but works fine in play, and it's totally ok to have some old witch-lady read your character's lifeline when he's a kid so he knows what his destiny is).  I mean, the player doesn't have any direct input into the fiction except by simply, well, roleplaying his character well.<br/><br/>This whole topic, which has now been mentioned in several threads, is very interesting to me because I do think real character-play, complete with funny voices, is necessary to get the most out of almost all RPGs\u2014and this *especially* includes most of the more "out there" Indie games.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268276/#Comment_268276" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T07:15:33+00:00" title="April 22, 2010  7:15AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2010 7:24AM by wburdick.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>The funny thing is, in that quote, I was really trying to get at was that I like games where the GM/Player thing is broken down, and that I enjoy some seperation between player and character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>That's how I like my gaming. I don't particularly want to feel some first person emotions or even get into a character's specific mind set. I want to be able to create some quirky and/or appropriate characters and put them in a bizarro situation and see where it goes.

You don't have to role play at all.  You can, but there is no character ownership.  You collaborate to build the story as you go, writing the fiction and creating the components (people, things, etc.).  Here's one of the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0An2MRkbkRMqbcEd1TDdTY2NNRWFNUnRBSDdMTXhQYkE&amp;hl=en&amp;gid=1" rel="nofollow">logs</a> from an old campaign that used Universalis.<br/><br/>Blood Red Sands might work for you too.  It does have character ownership, but it's still much more of a story telling game, as I see it.  It's not really about motivations and getting into your character's head.  It's about blood, battle, and victory!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268305/#Comment_268305" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T09:54:46+00:00" title="April 22, 2010  9:54AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Also, you might be looking for Mark Hughes' excellent Six Word RPG.
