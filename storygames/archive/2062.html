<p>So, I was thinkin' about <em>why</em> SotC's Aspect system bugs me, and I dunno for sure what it is, but here's an idea for what I'd do if I wanted to make it into a more Shreyas-friendly game.</p>
<p>The GM shall not be a tyrant. All that noise about "You can use an Aspect if the GM says it's okay" goes out the window - I trust the people I play with utterly to use their things in cool ways. No one has the ability to block them.</p>
<p>We dump the compelling system as well.</p>
<p>The GM has no ability to make mechanical challenges for free, or maybe he can make them require a +0 result at most. For anything further, he has to invoke character Aspects, or Aspects that the players have assigned to other entities. For each Aspect he uses in a scene, any player may award him with a Strife coin (of which there is an unlimited supply); he can only recieve one coin per Aspect. (That's to say, we trust the GM too; he gets coins based on the least demanding player.) A Strife coin can buy an Aspect for the GM, or +2 to a skill, or a stunt, they he can apply to some entity, or +2 difficulty to some one-time challenge.</p>
<p>If he invokes a player Aspect to directly create adversity, then the player gets a Fate point for that. If he uses it for just kinda fun happy time, then there's no Fate point involved.</p>

                            I like what I see so far. Questions:<br/><br/>What about Aspects that you take for an NPC as the result of conflict; i.e., Concessions? By the word of your tweak, the GM could only ever concede when he has a Strife coin to spend for the Aspect (I'm still undecided about this - it is subtle, but is it elegant or is it broken?).<br/><br/>Does anything change in the field of Aspect Assessment? A player knows  an Aspect asks for assessment as soon as the GM spends a Strife coin without using it for skill/stunt usage - that helps me because I know there is something to Assess. Cool or not?<br/><br/>Declaration is a player device to introduce Aspects, so my guess is there will be no change necessary. Right?<br/><br/>PS: Again, a game more and more looks like a heavily gimmick'd Universalis to me.                        </div>

<p>This one too. But, in general, I think the players are constrained more than enough in this system; the hack is intended to bring the GM in line, and simultaneously provide him with systematic support to align his contributions to the players' interests. Given that design goal, I think you are better able to guess my answer than I am able to give it.</p>

                            Assessment and Declaration are explained on page 83ff, in the Skills section (they describe a certain use of skills pertaining directly to aspects. These two pages might have been better placed around 38-44, but I see the logic. I just always look for them in the wrong place first. Maybe I should make a post-it there telling me I want to look at page 83).<br/><br/>Assessment is a 'mother-may-i' mechanism for perception skills, making them somewhat better than the 'roll until you find the necessary clue' we know from elsewhere - this gets better by your tweak because I know there *is* something to be found as soon as the GM buys an aspect. It could use some more punch, though, if you want to drive home your design goal more.<br/><br/>Declaration is a cool use for knowledge skills that are at times (mechanically useless) pieces of color.                        </div>

<p>Hm. I would eliminate assessment, or make it a form of declaration, or whatever - when the GM spends a strife coin, that becomes an invitation for a player to define the Aspect. I don't think we need a spider keeping secrets at the table. I presume, given SotC's propensity for charging players to do anything important, that it costs them a Fate coin to do a declaration? I think that goes out the window, too.</p>

                            Declaration is for free. Quoting the rules:
<blockquote><br/>Perception skills only allow the discovery of what already exists . By contrast, knowledge skills will often allow declaration â€“ in other words, using a knowledge skill successfully can allow a player to introduce entirely new facts into play, and then use those facts to his advantage.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>For example, an anthropologist with a solid Academics skill might use the declaration ability to state new truths about a tribe the characters have just encountered â€“ and if successful, suddenly the scene or the tribe has an aspect on it in keeping with the fact the player just invented. As with maneuvering and assessment, the first tagging of this aspect is free.  <br/></blockquote>
What would need to get out/be changed to keep in spirit with your original idea is this subtle notion of GM fiat regarding Declaration of aspects (separated from above for clarity):
<blockquote><br/>The GM is encouraged to use creativity as her primary guideline, when judging the use of knowledge skills.  Creative and entertaining facts will be more likely to result in a successful use of a knowledge skill, and thus give rise to a temporary aspect, than boring facts will.<br/><br/>[...]  <br/><br/>Any aspects brought into play by these methods do not have to go away after theyâ€™re used, if the GM wishes them to persist (or if circumstances merely make it reasonable that they hang around). Any subsequent uses of such aspects, however, will cost (or grant!) a fate point, as usual. This does mean that occasionally maneuvers and assessments and declarations will backfire, leading to a compel. Since aspects are involved, such things are easily double-edged!<br/></blockquote>
PS: In my humble opinion, your perception that anything interesting costs the players something is stunted. In fact, it does *not* cost players anything to initially tag aspects (use them to their advantage) they found by assessing or created by maneuvering or declaration. In addition, the free use of an aspect can be transferred to another character, giving room for the separation of analysis and action. Finally, stunts and skills in general do not need fate points to be used, and they can convey interesting stuff by themselves quite well.                        </div>

<p>This is based on a different expense - time. I'm not really convinced that we are using 'interesting' to mean the same things here, because to me, stunts and skills are stumbling blocks on the way to expressing what I was gonna do anyway. It's more a matter of being <em>unable</em> to do something because some stunt or other says you need to have it to do it, or some skill or other says you need to roll it to do it.</p>

                            Your experience of Aspects is very different from mine, Shreyas.  I don't see the GM as having fiat over aspects.  When I play, it's group control, for the most part, that governs when aspects are tagged or compelled.  A GM compelling an aspect is a great way for players to gain more fate points so that later on in the final battle against the evil Dr. Robot they can slam them down and make some really awesome moves.  Or even in minor conflict they can spend them to create an aspect that is useful to them (shooting down a chandelier to give the room "on fire" or "dark" depending on the type of chandelier).  I've seen this used quite effectively between two players: one creates the aspect, the next one gets to tag it for free, since it's the first time it's being tagged.  Nonetheless, I can see players saying to the GM "nuh-uh.  That really doesn't apply here." and I like that solution much better to adding more rules.  The more complicated things get, the more confused I get.  So, I agree with you that the GM doesn't get to have complete control over aspects, but I don't think adding more rules is the way to do that.<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>

<p>Nancy, thanks for your input. It's cool to hear that the game is going well for you. This isn't about experience, though - it's about the fact of the rules-as-written. That's where my play departs from, so that's where I approach things to change them.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the things tying the GM's contributions to the characters are too weak and I am tying them tighter, so that the GM is supported systemically to do stuff that is good.</p>
<p>I don't thing <em>more rules</em> are necessarily <em>bad rules</em> when they do something that I want or need.</p>

                            I think new rules creation is a personal preference thing.  I struggle to learn systems and don't understand rules until I can see and use them in play and pause and figure out exactly how that worked and why.  So, for me, more rules = more complication and more time to feel comfortable with the system.  Therefore, when I don't like something about the rules, I tend to just ignore it rather than coming up with a mechanical fix.  Thus, the rules-as-written say the GM has the authority to nay-say an aspect use and this can be used to be really mean, but I don't know if I'd want to play with a GM who would maliciously not let a player use an aspect.  So, I just remove/morph that rule to make it a group decision and that's much easier for me to handle than inventing new jargon and needing new counters (strife counters).<br/><br/>I'm curious by what you mean, in examples, changing things so the GM is systematically supported to "do stuff that is good"?  It seems to me the structure of the game is that the characters need to fail or not do very well on some early conflicts in order to gain more chips to tag aspects and really kick ass later in the adventure.  Is it this basic structure that you don't like, or something else (beyond the whole GM-fiat over aspects thing)?<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>

                            Just a quick note, Nancy. Shreya's use of the term "tyrany" isn't assuming a bad GM. It's assuming an enlightened GM who's doing a good job. He still thinks that the "monitoring" steps implied are unneccessary in these cases for the style of play he wants.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, "ignoring rules" is changing them. And a lot of how Shreyas is altering the rules. He's just doing it explicitly.<br/>

<p>I'm curious by what you mean, in examples, changing things so the GM is systematically supported to "do stuff that is good"? It seems to me the structure of the game is that the characters need to fail or not do very well on some early conflicts in order to gain more chips to tag aspects and really kick ass later in the adventure. Is it this basic structure that you don't like, or something else (beyond the whole GM-fiat over aspects thing)?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Basically what I am trying to change is the fact that the GM is totally disconnected from what the players care about. He has the <em>option</em> to do what they care about, but there are no tools in place for the players to signal what that is (that's what strife coins do) or to constrain him against doing stuff that doesn't matter. So there's a communication gap there, and a serious inequality in the power relationship - the GM can do whatever the hell he likes, and the players don't have any authority to walk all over or away from it unless he grants it.</p>
<p>Edit: crossposted with Mike, and in that light, notice:<br>
<em>There are artifacts of that relationship present even when the GM is not being a dick about aspects, and these artifacts are what I'm working to eliminate.</em></br></p>
<p>Thinking about that makes me want to say that Strife should only last a scene, or should be rewarded to <em>entities</em> rather than to the GM himself... more likely the second instead of the first. This way, the GM can't look at your aspects - maybe you are Gorilla Khan's long-lost brother and you both feel kind of weird around Lucy Lawless - and use them to get Strife with which he then introduces something totally dumb like the Martian laser invaders who want to meet the President.</p>
<p>I'm quite aware that I'm not offering the GM the same trust I am offering the players. It is the consequence of being deposed.</p>

I thought the aspects and top skills were indicative of what is important to a character and how to get them actively engaged in the action.  However, I see your point about the Martian laser invaders.  But, what's to stop the GM from introducing them anyhow?  I'm unclear how strife actually changes game play.  Maybe it doesn't.  Maybe it just adds a way for the players to reward the GM for doing things they like, which I guess is what you're trying to get at.  (See, this is why I don't make new rules.  It's taken three posts to figure out what strife does.)  Am I on the right track?<br><br>--Nancy                        </br></br></div>

<p>Nothing, in fact. But, if we use this new description of strife:</p>
<p>The players award strife to an <em>entity</em>, a character, location, or other thing that they think is cool that the GM introduced, and strife is spent to affect that entity...</p>
<p>Then, if the players give the Martians no strife, they have no mechanical clout, and the players will either ignore them or take them out trivially.</p>

<p>This is food for thought.</p>
<p>So, my design reflex is to build games without a GM. I do not understand the impetus to include GM-roles in games. That's strongly informing my ideas, I'm sure, and it might be angling toward GM-weaker-than-players, which is kinda lame.</p>
<p>So, supposing that we took the GM role out of the picture? Maybe Strife can be made into a player resource, used to inflict adversity onto the characters of other players. This is a lot closer to my preferred mode of play, and as you point out it does seem to be where it's going anyway.</p>
<p>That will require some thinking about how one <em>obtains</em> Strife, and some thinking about how the tasks that SotC gives to the GM, scene-framing and such, are distributed. Hm.</p>

                            Assuming we go entirely GMless, my inclination would be to move the aspects onto a physical medium, such as cards, and possibly introduce some randomization into their introduction.  Assuming you have a set of cards for the players, you may also have a "Campaign deck" (perhaps built using 1000 blank cards style) then you could do somethign as simple as throw down a scene with 5 cards to perhaps a more sophisticated "10 cards face up, grab 4 to craft a scene, each turn at narrator adds a card) or the like.  For player aspects, the card coming up is a compel-equivalent, while a setting element coming up is an _initial_ compel but it then considered "in play".  As such, if the "On Fire" aspect is played onto a scene, it's intitally a problem (the room catches on fire) but for subsequent narration, it's a color element that might be usable for good or ill.<br/><br/>Just talkign loosely here, but the bottom line is that I think that physicality is really the key.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            What do you want the Strife mechanic to do that, say, players controlling NPCs that have aspects and their own fate points doesn't do?<br/><br/>I mean, I think I'm hearing that you're not really interested in creating opposition in the sense of "roll to fix this device" or "roll to see if you find incriminating evidence in the safe". If I'm wrong, feel free to correct me.<br/><br/>So if that's the case, and you expect the main source of adversity in your play to be character-based, why not just decentralize who plays the characters that stand against a particular PC, and use Strife as more of a meta-currency to make sure that the *content* of conflicts are focused/cool, in a sort of backwards application of PTA's fan mail?<br/><br/>Eh, that's an arcane phrasing. Lemme try and be practical: Your basic goal seems to be "All conflicts in play should be overtly supported by someone's interest, and that interest should be easily communicated through a currency mechanic." Okay, so. Suppose you're up for a scene, and you decide to break into the bad guy's warehouse to see if you can get a reading of what he's up to. Another player thinks there are weird armored guards that might be half-robotic, and you go, "Cool," because your character is a mad scientist and this stuff is right up his alley. You give him a Strife coin, and maybe so does everyone else at the table who thinks it's a good idea. Now he has three Strife, which he can then turn into bigger opposition for your character. <br/><br/>Is that more in the arena of what you're looking for? I'm wary of suggesting that you tie aspects too deeply into this system, because I'm not really convinced that flagging mechanics are often (if ever) really a clear indicator of what players want or are interested in... at best, they're a good starting point that you build from. People tend to be bad judges of this, IME, and I've seen a lot of Fate play where initial aspects that sounded cool at the time get changed because they weren't as cool when the rubber hit the road.                        </div>

<p>This sounds pretty reasonable too. But what's to stop people from changing their aspects occasionally, or just not awarding strife for them? The aspects are flaggish, but they are merely the valves for a much more responsive fanmail economy. I've never seen fanmail fail.</p>

Nothing prevents it. All I'm saying is that you should probably allow Strife to be awarded for including *any* content that is cool/relevant, as opposed to content that chains off of an aspect, for maximal flexibility to account for emergent game content. If you still want to emphasize the idea of aspects as focusing tools, you can always say that you get two Strife points for being aspect-relevant, or something like that.<br/><br/>(Edit: Can't seem to figure out why it went italic, and can't get rid of it.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>Heck, if you're going GMless, collapse it all into fate points again, and add Strife's "powers" to fate points, since you're just talking about players doing stuff for players.</blockquote>
I was thinking the along the same lines. Instead of adding new concepts and rules, remove rules and collapse concepts:
<ul>
<li> Remove the GM  <br/></li><li> Let players compel other players' Aspects, either sacrificing one of their <i>own</i> Fate Points or "earning" the compelled player's Fate Point.  <br/></li><li> Maybe democratize the process by letting other players spend their Fate Points on either side of a compel (requiring the compeller or compellee to spend another Fate Point).  <br/></li></ul>
I haven't played Capes, but this is starting to sound a little like it. &lt;:)                        </div>
