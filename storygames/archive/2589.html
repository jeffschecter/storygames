At least, it got that way pretty quickly after about half of the first page (up until then it was pretty cool, actually). I don't think that it's reflective of how things normally operate around here at all, mind.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I'd rather not go too far into self-flagellation. I think in the regular high-spirited, enthusiastic threads people are just that; High spirited and enthusiastic.<br/><br/>I see frustration here and there.  Some certain folks tend to be historically snappy with certain other folks here or online or whatever. Not much that can be done about that than to politely offer that it's always worth giving someone a liberal read before deciding for sure that Person X is Pissing You Off.<br/><br/>I hope people can remember that there are other people on the other ends of those screens, and empathize more.<br/><br/>All in all, though, I'm not seeing it as a 'growing trend', or anything at this point when looking through the sheer dumpload of threads, even on just the first page.<br/><br/>Still, I would totally love it if people would chill out a little more. Take the dismissives to "whisper" if you have to do it at all.

But, I can understand: They're important issues. There's a lot of emotion involved.  People get too high strung in these situations, and simply don't know how to untangle themselves. These topics are too hot to handle, perhaps, even by the people who feel the most passionate about them.<br/><br/>I believe that people have the power to disagree with each other and carry on a discussion, if they're mature about it. Hell, it's what I did for four years straight in college (pragmatists vs the neo-platanists in our philosophy classes at a primarily Catholic college: throwing down in the classroom, making points, taking notes, and then all going out for beers after the big debates and realizing how much we rubbed off on each other). There's still influence, debate, and talking to be done. Points can be made, people can come to new realizations. As long as everyone is out to continue the conversation, and not just out to bury knives in backs. At least, that's what I believe.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59405/#Comment_59405" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T21:28:41+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  9:28PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Andy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59406/#Comment_59406" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T21:33:28+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  9:33PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2007 9:36PM by Andy.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>What if we talked about ways that we can be productive and respectful...

After seeing this, I feel almost embarrassed for the above. :-)  <br/><br/>Because, really, I think this is the important thing worth addressing.<br/><br/>Here's what I did: I just whispered a message not as an Admin, but as a buddy to a buddy who I saw was exhibiting the behaviors Graham noted lately. I figured that since I noticed it, I might as well come out and tell them what I thought; maybe then, in time, that person may do something about it. Or not, it's their choice, but at least I did my part to plug up some sort of Online Relationship Death Spiral.<br/><br/>Kinda like how friends don't let friends Drink and Drive, I guess I'm going to adopt a policy of Emailing or Whispering to friends who I think may have said something harsh, just to see if that's what they were intending, etc.<br/><br/>So that's one way.<br/><br/>Any other practical ways?<br/><br/>Personally, what I tend to do, and it's hard sometimes (oh god is it hard sometimes), is to give people the benefit of the doubt.  Someone says something kinda off-putting, I think of reasons why I might be reading into it.<br/>* I might be in a bad mood, so I'm willfully reading too much nastiness into this person.<br/>* English might not be this dude's first language, and they don't know that their tone sounds 'strong'. This happens often on BBSes, and even in the Race thread.<br/>* I might have had a falling out or argument with this person, so I might be reading a "tone" in here that they don't mean.<br/>* The person is being ernest, and not just a dick for the hell of it.<br/><br/>So I try to Read Nice into people when possible (HERE anyway).  I figure if it works for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004335/bio" rel="nofollow">Hrithik Roshan</a>, it might work for me, too.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59407/#Comment_59407" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T21:35:25+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  9:35PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2007 9:35PM by Mcdaldno.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (x-posted with Andy)<br/><br/>In response to Shreyas' question about "What can people do to improve this?"...<br/><br/><br/>One thing that I noticed was working was when people made "I statements" about their own stance. For example, "I don't feel like a racist when..." came up several times.<br/><br/>And one response to those "I statements" that I saw working really well was "Well, have you considered....?" and "Try thinking about the situation in terms of...", etc. Some people have a really good habit of engaging a viewpoint, instead of shooting it down.<br/><br/>Other people tended to say "No, actually..." and that's where shit stopped moving forward.<br/><br/>So, some things that can work well:<br/><br/>1. If you're on an opinion thread, or a thread about a sensitive topic, make your statements about you. Use "I statements". Sometimes this means radically recasting your argument/contribution, whereas sometimes it simply means prefacing what you say with "In my experience..."<br/><br/>2. Instead of discrediting someone's viewpoint, engage it. Seek to show people an alternate viewpoint as a first priority, as opposed to shutting their viewpoint down as a first priority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59409/#Comment_59409" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T21:44:04+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  9:44PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2007 9:44PM by Brand_Robins.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know what would help me? <br/><br/>An ignore list. <br/><br/>That way I could put everyone on it. <br/><br/>Then I would wander around a Storygames with no posts, and be happy in my zen.<br/><br/>No, wait, that's worse....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59411/#Comment_59411" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T21:47:53+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  9:47PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>1.

Of course, on a hot topic, this means you may get lost in the press of postings -- so, really, this is a method that works best when the majority of posters in a thread agree to more-or-less abide by it (e.g. if the original poster prefaces her thread with an appeal to let things simmer a bit before typing out a reply).<br/><br/>-- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59415/#Comment_59415" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T21:59:42+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  9:59PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2007 10:01PM by Andy.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I realized here in a Whisper to someone (talking more about the philosophy/sociology degree undergrad experience).  A lame parable, maybe, but it may help shed light on what I'm seeing:<br/><br/>-----<br/>In my circles (we were the nietzsche - wittgenstein (later) - rorty - reading pragmatists) there were folks in the philosophy department (like the "Christian Morales Uber Alles neo-platanist" guy, or the "I LOVE BUSINESS AND CAPITALISM! CAPITALISM IS NEVER WRONG!" philosophy/business major enthusiast dude, or the "I don't think much about anything, but will destroy any argument you make for the fun of it" chick) that I was totally at odds with. Like, "holy shit I can't believe I'm not wringing this guy's neck", whether we were talking about gender issues, business ethics, religion, society issues, or hippie-postmodern sociological garbage. It was literally amazing that there weren't fistfights. But I think part of it was that we forced ourselves to at least get to know the other people a little more.<br/><br/>Basically, somewhere along the line (I dunno how it happened. By accident, probably) we forced ourselves to have relationships with the other people in our classes, including (especially) the ones that we 'hated'. After a while, we noticed some good and bad things:<br/><br/>The good: you realize you respect your 'enemy' more than you thought, and they respect you. Your ideas rub off on each other, and sometimes you see things in a new light. The more closed-off you are the longer it takes, but it eventually happens.<br/><br/>The bad: it's harder to hate them and cast their ideas aside as rubbish, if you know them by first name and have gone out for drinks with them. Plus, if you wanted your pristine ideas to stay untainted by self-doubt, starting a relationship (ie "aquaintence") with that person is the wrong way to do it. Ostracism is easier than Empathy.<br/><br/>It seems that for a lot of ugly interactions here (or on TEH INTERNETS), most people involved just want to do the latter (the things associated with "the bad": Keep their ideas, not start a conversation, not defend their ideas, stay untouched by self-doubt in their righteousness, and WANT to have a reason to hate someone). They don't spend the time investing in a relationship to get the good benefits.<br/><br/>Hey, it's The Internet, so there's no reason to start a relationship with every person you disagree with, or stay in a community surrounded by people who you can't stand (or vice versa); you can always bounce to another peer community where everyone is on the same page.  But if you find a community that you want to interact with, and think that there's enough of a positive quotient that you could get some benefits over time, investing that time into relationships (mostly: Just by communication, dropping posts; but specifically by Being Nice, Enhancing Empathy, Not dismissing another viewpoint, etc) pays off for all parties, according to my little lame parable's "the good" list. <br/><br/>Again, just a parable, not a Way of Living or anything.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59416/#Comment_59416" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T22:11:45+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 10:11PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2007 10:17PM by Brand_Robins.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm impressed we made it <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1951" rel="nofollow">three months since the last one</a>.

Once I've done this I generally come to the following conclusions:  <br/><br/>1.) The heated discussion is happening due to a clash of core value systems.  <br/>2.) No one is likely to change my core values on this discussion forum.<br/>3.) I'm not likely to change anyone else's core values on this discussion forum.<br/><br/>So, most of the time I just decide that it isn't worth stirring the pot any more than it is already stirred.  I'll just get upset and irritated.  I'll make other people upset and irritated.  Most of the time for no good reason.

But its a fucking thread about racism. On the internet. Its going to suck. <br/><br/>There was some dumb shit pulled. Once again, thread about racism, internet. <br/><br/>However, in general, I found that thread to be less offensive, stupid, and rhetorically dodgy than a lot of similar threads, including ones on this very board. Yes things got hot, but people also did manage to have some actually communication going on. I was actually enjoying the back and forth with like Tad and Jasper and some others, because there are a lot of subtle points around the core issue that are well worth talking about. <br/><br/>The only unfortunate thing that happened, in context of my POV given thread about racism|internet, is that we kind of got to a point where sides were drawn up. Which is unfortunate, because I'm willing to bet that no one on any given "side" fully agrees in every detail with every member of their "side." I know that Jonathan and I have different opinions about several issues of racism, but we never got a chance to really talk about them because it did start to feel like any crack in the damn would let loose a flood. I'm sure others felt the same -- if I admit that Chris may have a point on 'this', then Brand is going to smack me about 'that', and while 'this' may be true I still don't think 'that' is. <br/><br/>Honestly, there isn't a whole lot to be done about this without changing a bunch of deeper order communications issues in the way we all talk to each other. Polite words and I statements can help, but they won't change the fundamental paradigmatic disconnects and they often can become shields for dodgy rhetoric themselves. But, in the spirit of looking like I'm trying to help at least, let me suggest the following: <br/><br/>1. Always respond to a specific person and what they actually said. Quote when needed. There is a real problem in theory threads (be it game theory or social theory) with people responding to what "they said" or even "what I thought they said" rather than to what a single person actually said. As soon as we start responding to "them" rather than "that jerk Brand" we have drawn up sides. Once we have sides, we have problems.<br/><br/>2. Always respond to the points people are making. If you are not sure what points they are making, ask for clarification rather than assuming. It is far too easy on the intertron to assume that people are saying things just like the demons in your head, the jerks at the FLGS, the twits at your highschool, or whatever would say. Sometimes its even true. More often its false. Quoting, as mentioned above, can help with this. Asking questions rather than making rejecting responses can also help. <br/><br/>3. Accept the fact that people are going to say stupid shit. Know that just because one person says it doesn't mean that the conversation is over, either with them or more importantly with the other people in the thread. No amount of I statements or careful phrasing are going to stop us from pissing each other off sometimes. When pissed you can strike back, flame out, and effectively end the communication, or you can just accept that such things happen but are not the end of the world, and try again later. <br/><br/>4. Spin off. When you aren't getting the answers you want in a thread, or when you're starting to run hard down a tangent, spin off a new thread. Seriously, taking a conversation to a new place where there isn't already a weight of 150 posts behind it full of unexamined assumptions, people who've only read the first 25 posts and are now responding to something that has already been covered 15 times, and a lot of invested emotion, can really help to get things focused on what you need them focused on. <br/><br/>5. Bitch, but bitch quietly. Andy's gonna hate my ass for this, but the truth is that venting is a normal part of human interactions. When you're starting to get ready to head-butt someone in the face, stop posting, find someone on IRC or IM and have a little bitch fest. Or make Andy's day and whisper the rage. Don't do this to work yourself up into a higher state of righteous indignation though. Use it as a chance for catharsis. Clear the system, then come back when you feel you can be rational. <br/><br/>6. Take it slower. This one is my personal issue, and judging by how fast hot button threads grow around here I'm betting I'm not the only one. A thread hitting 150 posts in a day is really not a good thing for communications, nor for the community being able to actually use and absorb the material there in. Someone logged on this morning and saw the racism thread and was like "the fuck? how did that get so big so fast? No way I'm going in there, there's no point -- its either all hate or I'm so far behind that I'll never catch up." There is a good chance a lot of people said that, and that a lot of those people would have had good things to contribute. But we all had to have our say as fast as possible, we had to respond now, and now, and NOW, and so the thread got long fast with everyone reacting in the moment rather than building a conversation. <br/><br/>7. Listen to what people tell you about your communication style. If someone you are arguing with tells you that you are being an ass, you may be being an ass. If someone you like who is on "your side" tells you that you are being an ass, you are probably being an ass. When someone from outside the conversation whispers you to tell you that you are being an ass, you are being an ass. <br/><br/>8. Do not talk about Storygames. <br/><br/>9. Do Not Talk About Storygames. <br/><br/>10. DO NOT TALK ABOUT STORYGAMES. <br/><br/>There. All of those suggestions are based in communications theory at one level or another. They may help some of us. They may help all of us. Most likely they won't help at all, because things don't change until enough of the community actually wants them to change rather than just wanting others to change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59632/#Comment_59632" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T11:08:13+00:00" title="March  7, 2007 11:08AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everything Brand said! \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mo</cite>Oh yeah, and I'd also love it if people could get a handle on using statements like: "I don't agree with that."

I honestly didn't think it was that bad. Like Brand says. It coulda been a whole lot worse, and the fact that we don't have any really flaming asses around here (myself excepted, of course) prevented things from getting really out of hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to say this, and I'm going to say it carefully. Chris Chinn was right to be offended, I think. But storming off as he did is something I've seen before in conversations on this subject in which he was involved. I won't speculate as to specifically why this happens, but let's just say that I was not at all surprised to see it happen. And I don't think that it says a ton about the quality of the discourse that was going on. That's in no way a condemnation of Chris, who I respect a lot (in fact, from a certain perspective it's a compliment). But the thread muddled on despite that. Judd and Droog came to a truce at least, and there were some intelligent things said on both sides.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it Story Games' shining moment? No, but I think that it's a testament to the stability of the place that it didn't degenerate any further than it did. Sorry for presenting the counterpoint, Graham, but I don't find SG nasty at all. Though, admittedly, that's probably because there's nobody meaner than I am.

I also agree that where the topic at hand addresses innately deep values, you're going to hit a certain degree of static as people process the emotional content.

Please look away if your sensibilities are delicate.<br><br>Here is a quote from Chris:\n<blockquote>The artwork in specific is a combination of the most horrible geisha girl/dragon lady imagery combined with yellow peril. But the fact that these stereotypes have become so normalized in depicting asian people that <b>white people</b> can't "see it" anymore, is what is particularly troublesome. I've shown that image to several non-gamers and gotten responses like, "What the FUCK is that?!?"<br>.............................<br>But you know- why bother with asking just me, or looking at just -that- piece. Ask about 4-5 <b>people of color</b> who are gamers about what they feel is racist art or depictions. You might be surprised.</br></br></blockquote>\nNow, I don't see a lot of "Gee shucks, this is just my opinion" there. It's just that it happens to be a popular opinion round here, so nobody disagreed.<br/><br/>I see divisive identity politics and white liberal guilt, personally. I think it's offensive to suggest that white people in general can't see or understand racism just as well as non-whites. Not that I'm offended; I just think it's pretty sloppy thinking.<br/><br/>If it comes to that, I've known highly racist Asian people; members of my own family included. I've also known plenty of sensitive white people. Some of my best friends are white, you know.<br/><br/>So the point I'm getting around to is that to me, it's what the words are really saying that's the important thing. You can say horrible things in very polite ways. To me "Oh, excuse me, but my opinion differs from yours" isn't substantially different from "This is what I think and it's the opposite to you".<br/><br/>I think people might want to examine what they get upset by and what they don't. There's all this talk about how nasty it was that TPM had Chinese trade reps and Rastafarian frogs and Jewish slave dealers (nobody seems to have noticed the Jewish magic-schleppers in Harry Potter), but there isn't anyone picking up on David Brin's commentary on the class implications of Star Wars. Lucas's jumbled broth of mysticism and aristocratic priviledge could arguably be a lot more damaging in the long run, when there's a generation of kids growing up with that for their fairy-stories. Now that's offensive.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59684/#Comment_59684" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T13:35:50+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  1:35PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2007 1:36PM by Sempiternity.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff,<br/><br/>Yeah, I'm a fan of Brin's writing too - but that thread was just about racism, so I made sure to stear clear of the other (related) topics, for the post that started the trouble.<br/><br/>But, if were to go on about the rpg setting evoked by those Steampunk Star Wars pictures?
