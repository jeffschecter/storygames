Not ideal but changing into a monster (and an adult) is core of the system and there is a mechanic that turns you into your monstrous form and makes you do bad things. If you are comfortable with the sexual themes and playing teenagers it might be a good choice otherwise it can be modded.<br/><br/>The World of Darkness can do all of these themes but the support by the rules is not ideal. Often the games do not turn out to be about how horrible it is to be a monster but finding a place in the society instead. Especially Werewolf I found lacking compared to the source material of werewolf mythology. A Humanity mechanic like in Vampire can work out as a rules help. Also the idea from old Wraith where players play their own character and each others monstrous sides can be used. To give the evil inside the characters a voice and take it out of their control.<br/>Changeling: The Lost looks like the best for what you want and the characters can be all kinds of monsters. There definatly is a feel of being hunted and having to trust others like you and interactions with the humanity you were taken away from can be a big part of the game.<br/>Making the societies of monsters a little less elaborate and not comforting at all can help a good bit for World of Darkness games that want to make being a monster suck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391208/#Comment_391208" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T10:07:36+00:00" title="September 24, 2012 10:07AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2012 10:28AM by Burr.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The World of Darkness can do all of these themes but the support by the rules is not ideal.

I've been playing nWoD lately, and that is precisely what inspired me to ask.  Having other players do the monster side is a great idea.  (Though I wonder if this would distance them too much rather than make them feel that it is <i>their</i> character the monster is making do horrible things -- that it is in fact their character who is the source of their own horror.)  I'll look into MonsterHearts, too, thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391210/#Comment_391210" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T10:34:59+00:00" title="September 24, 2012 10:34AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd suggest looking strongly at Sorcerer. It very much focuses on these sorts of themes. I imagine it would be pretty easy to shift the flavor from magic powered by tempting demons to power derived from the dark feral self.<br/><br/>The central theme of "how far are you willing to go to get what you want?", combined with tracking Humanity as the measure of existential failure seems like it would be perfect for hitting what you are aiming at.<br/><br/>I would suggest attempting to tweak it as little as possible. Shift the source of power from demons to the feral self (which can work basically the same way), but leave the whole rest of the game intact.<br/><br/>Also - consider running the game small (no more than 4 players) and with not everyone running werewolves. Otherwise it can become hard to keep the game from focusing on superpowered badassery. Keep it intimate. Focus on parallel stories happening at the same time. Have players play the NPCs of each others' scenes, maybe. Look to Prime Time Adventures for ideas about story structure, to supplement the bangs structure of Sorcerer.<br/><br/>Also, PTA is good in terms of thinking about a story with a conclusion (5-7 sessions is what they suggest, if I recall correctly), rather than an endless campaign. For the kind of theme-heavy game you're talking about, structuring it as working towards a conclusion rather than being eternally open-ended seems like a good idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391211/#Comment_391211" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T10:37:07+00:00" title="September 24, 2012 10:37AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well the Shadow in Wraith where I lifted the idea is more mephistophelian in nature. So maybe give the player of the monstrous side bonus dice to barter and have the monster's player describe the final deed and how he or she does it.<br/>I only really used the technique for a longer time playing Monster and other childish things. Where the monster have stuff to barter but aren't necessarily a source of horror all the time. They can make the kids do evil stuff though. Different tone than what you want of course. But it worked out well in that game.<br/><br/>And yeah I must have started writing while you edited. If you have the hunter antagonist books there you can find monsters that are made to be opponents and source of horror. Still within the NWOD system. Maybe ideas could be lifted there. The mages one was well done if i remember.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391212/#Comment_391212" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T10:48:24+00:00" title="September 24, 2012 10:48AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first instinct also would be to go with Sorcerer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/asurber" title="asurber"><img alt="asurber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/asurber">asurber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391226/#Comment_391226" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T12:47:38+00:00" title="September 24, 2012 12:47PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2012 1:14PM by asurber.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd second the use of Sorcerer, including reading the Urge mini-supplement.   With a strong situation setup and player buy in, I think you can achieve A thru D.<br/><br/>I haven't played Monsterheart yet, but I'd think it worth a look but from my reading its more angst than horror.  It reminded me of MTVs Teen Wolf Series. <br/><br/>I played lots of oWOD,  we never developed the level of horror your describing.  I like the system as a starting point but I think it would take some hacking to get a true horror feel. <br/><br/>I've only played one game of "Dead inside", PDQ is a very flexible rules light system.  It's about soul-less person who is seeking a soul, I think it could be easily be modified to do the the type of horror your thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391227/#Comment_391227" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T12:49:43+00:00" title="September 24, 2012 12:49PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2012 12:51PM by mease19.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about Don't Rest Your Head?
