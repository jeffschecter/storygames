That's his MO for every game he plays, he likes to create weird shit and do things with it you'd never expect (like magic items, weird tech, anything).  <br/><br/>I'm worried that he will impede the group's ability to address premise and produce a cohesive narrative.  I'm worried he won't give a shit about NPCs and I won't be able to challenge him in meaningful ways without just hitting him hard with violence.<br/><br/>If I ask him to not play I will be the dick as we're a group of friends with a static gaming group.  I asked him if he could keep his dicking around to a minimum and his response was, "I can't promise that."  He said it in a jovial manner and he sees nothing wrong with what he wants out of gaming.  I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong there (he doesn't dick with other players), but I'm not sure it aligns with what I want out of gaming and I'm not sure what to do about it.  <br/><br/>Am I worried for no reason?  I could use some encouraging words as we're going to be starting up an Apocalypse World game this week and I'm really looking forward to it, albeit with the above reservations.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324487/#Comment_324487" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T16:30:56+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  4:30PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            iDo the rest of your group really enjoy the games you guys play?

There's a lot of crazy fuckers out there that do shit for no reason. Though some folks seem to be suggesting that you hammer the guy when he acts out and that's just plain passive-aggressive bullshit GMing. Follow the rules for MCing.  It's not your job to punish him or make him miserable.<br/><br/>That said, this is really a social problem.  If you feel like you can't play certain games with this dude and still have fun, don't do it.  There's plenty of games that are great fun for dicking around that you guys could both enjoy.  Agon comes to mind.  Anima Prime.  The thing is: you can't really blame this on the player, it sounds like.  He's been up front about what he's into and how he's probably going to play.  You can only do so much if that's what he wants to do at the table and you want to do other stuff, at least some of the time.  So play games together that you both can enjoy and play other games with other people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324502/#Comment_324502" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T18:20:46+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  6:20PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2011 6:22PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>That's where he gets his enjoy from which doesn't align with my interests in roleplaying at all.</blockquote>\nStop playing with him. If the thing that is annoying you about how he plays is the very thing he enjoys most about playing, that is not going to work.<br/><br/>I mean, okay, you can try AW, but there is no game that is going to magically fix the fact that you very clearly find his playstyle aggravating and frustrating to deal with. Unleashing in-character repercussions as some kind of overzealous corrective is the 1980s D&amp;D GM Advice method, and I am pretty sure it has never worked. The advice being given about how to run AW is fine of course, and maybe the game will somehow serve as a magic corrective and engage him in a whole new way -- certainly, AW supports his style of play very well -- but it's advice for how to run the game for everyone, not special fix-it-all advice that will make you find this person any less aggravating.<br/><br/>Edit: crossposted with Jonathan, who said it better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324503/#Comment_324503" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T18:25:54+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  6:25PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I'm not really clear on what the problem is from the description?<br/><br/>This dude comes to games, hangs out, has a good time. He does some semi-random stuff to NPCs in the setting to provoke a reaction from them (maybe from Charles too? donno).  Seems like a pretty normal method of exploration, like tossing a flare into the dark cave with the weird noises to see what happens.  In some games this is super dangerous and he'll be going through characters like kleenex.  In some games the world/NPCs are pretty safe to explore and they won't do more than shake their fist and say "Curse you, you're such a dick!"  I guess the problem would be is if you are creating a dangerous world and he thinks it's safe ("I was just playing around, this guy is beating my head in with an axe? This game sucks!") or vice versa ("Christ, how far can I push this guy, for reals?!")<br/><br/>I mean, leaving aside the fictional behavior, I wonder if you have ever said to the dude, "Hey, can you take this game/session seriously?

Which is not badwrongfun or disruptive, it's just not what I'm looking for.  I guess you could say he is disrupting my fun but I don't blame him for it as like others have pointed out, he's being uprfront about it and he's not doing it maliciously.  He's told me that if he likes his character he will dick around more - he didn't like his Burning Wheel character in the past so he didn't really do anything in game and was bored.  <br/><br/>Jason - I think you're right about probing for a reaction, to some degree.  I think he's looking for humor and laughs from the table as well.  I do softball him sometimes and don't bring enough reprisals for dicking with dangerous people and perhaps I can be better with that when we start playing AW.  <br/><br/>Part of this is my problem I guess as I'm looking for serious roleplaying centered around the story and addressing premise and he just wants to dick around in a sandbox and create whacknut stuff.  His goofiness is wearing off on one player in particular and I guess I'm looking for advice on dealing with this playstyle in AW.  The points about AW handling this with GM moves is a good point, I guess we'll just have to see how it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324517/#Comment_324517" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T20:23:01+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  8:23PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite>I don't know, I would think poisoning an entire town<i>for no reason</i>to be a little bit above and beyond tossing a flare into the dark cave, yeah?<br/><br/><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>I asked him if he could keep his dicking around to a minimum and his response was, "I can't promise that."</blockquote>\nThis to me would be a major warning sign.

I did it in public but I didn't chastize him or anything, I said something like "Can you try and keep the dicking around to a minimum when we start up AW this week?"  No one views his dicking around as a big deal or inconvenience so it wasn't like the group ganging up on him.  <br/><br/>I didn't think about contacting him privately, he may not blow me off as directly.  I might try sending him an email after the first session if I see some warning signs.  I did copy the Apocalypse World player advice of "Play your character as if he's a real person." and mentioned something about "I don't mind if you dick around as long as you portray your character as a real person and don't dick over the story" into an email I sent to the group so maybe that will get through to him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324527/#Comment_324527" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T21:50:12+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  9:50PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From what I am picking up from the discussion and adding it to some of my own experience in the past, this is the kid of guy that probably used a magnifying glass to burn ants for laughs.<br/><br/>Basically, he's not going to mess with the other players because their characters are "real." The players are his friends and he doesn't want to do any "real" harm.<br/><br/>However, NPCs are diffferent. They aren't "real" in his mind, so he feels like he can do whatever he wants with them. It sounds like its along the lines of gallows humor where he emtertains himself and probably other players at the table. If they are laughing at his antics, then they are encouraging this behavior. And since his targets aren't "real" he feels no guilt over doing things that would be heinous crimes in real life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324529/#Comment_324529" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T22:02:09+00:00" title="May 14, 2011 10:02PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like you should try him on <i>kill puppies for satan</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324533/#Comment_324533" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T22:47:34+00:00" title="May 14, 2011 10:47PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>I'm worried he won't give a shit about NPCs and I won't be able to challenge him in meaningful ways</blockquote>\nDoes he want to be challenged? <br/><br/>If he is making his own fun, do you need to challenge him?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>he's having a blast in our current Dungeon World game where he's an Evil halfling thief who has poisoned a town and beaten a man to death for little to no reason.</blockquote>\nWhat happened after he poisoned an entire town and beat a man to death for no reason?<br/><br/>How did the players react?<br/>How did the NPCs react?<br/>How did the world react?<br/><br/>Does he care if his actions have consequences? <br/><br/>I'm not saying "consequences" as in "punish his behavior."

Just stay true to the fiction. But if he wants to play a sociopath but doesn't want the world to care... if he wants to play in a world where you can murder people and nothing happens... then I'm not quite sure what world you are playing in.

I mean, yes, it can be interesting to run with the "One of my companions has turned out to be a high-functioning psychopathic killer, how do I respond?" plot once or twice, but speaking from personal experience after the fourth time a player's character has diablerized half the court in Vampire it gets a little old. It might be that the GM wants to introduce a situation that doesn't eventually devolve into just pursuing the consequences of John's latest murdering spree, even if the murdering spree itself is fairly creative and involves unexpected use of magic items or weirdtech or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324569/#Comment_324569" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T08:08:13+00:00" title="May 15, 2011  8:08AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2011 8:10AM by jenskot.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Ben said.<br/><br/>Agony already gave 2 clear examples of "dicking around". Poisoning a town and randomly beating an NPC to death for no reason. <br/><br/>Agony also said his friend was playing an evil character. Are the rest of the players good guys? Why are they allowing an evil character to fight along side them and murder random people? <br/><br/>I've seen gamers who want to play Grand Theft Auto in a roleplaying game. They want to push limits and cause chaos. Which in Grand Theft Auto is ok partially because it is a solo experience (and even in GTA, as you commit crimes, there are consequences). But acting this way in an RPG is problematic because it is a group activity. If the group isn't on board, it causes problems. If the group majority doesn't want rape in their game, and a player starts raping people... there is a problem. And if you ask them, please stop raping people... and they say they can't promise that... then it's a problem no game (as JDCorley mentions) can solve. I use rape as an example because I've seen it happen multiple times. And mass murdering innocent people is just as extreme. <br/><br/>If I invite you over my house and say you can eat anything in my refrigerator except for my tomatoes because I need them for a recipe tomorrow... and you then intentionally eat my tomatoes... you have a problem no game or rule will solve. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>That's his MO for every game he plays, he likes to create weird shit and do things with it you'd never expect (like magic items, weird tech, anything).</blockquote>\nI think this is what is throwing off many of the responses. This sounds cool! To me, as a GM, this would be a gift!

I haven't gamed with this guy for very long and we've only played a few games together.  I've known him about a year and we play a lot of board games and miniature games together so I don't have a ton of RPG anecdotal evidence.<br/><br/>One more example, in our Burning Wheel game he shot an NPC in the head with his pistol in his first session.  The NPC was a cultist trying to rally people in the group's town but at that point it was non-violent social positioning.  The player executed him in broad daylight in the 2nd scene of the 1st session of the campaign.  It actually kind of worked as it kicked things off and I didn't have a problem with it (although it surprised the hell out of me) but the reason he did it was because he wanted to cause chaos and mess around.  I feel like this will get old quick and the stuff he's been doing in Dungeon World has been slightly annoying but half the group is evil and half is neutral so it's not a big hang up.<br/><br/>Dicking around was the term he used, you could swap the word messing for dicking if you'd like.  This is how he plays video games as well.  He was telling me stories about how he tries to break games online for fun (like Battlefield 1942 was one of his favorite games because of all the crazy shit you could do like ram jeeps into each other and send them flying off into the sky).  <br/><br/>I'll see how AW works out and hopefully I will still have a good time and will be able to be a fan of his character.

AW is not going to fix this for you. The only thing that is going to fix it is getting the other player to buy in to trying to learn a new way of playing the games -- your way. If he doesn't believe that could be fun, or he doesn't believe that there is a meaningful difference in how you play, then in-game mojo isn't going to change that.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you do get that buy-in and conscious, self-aware desire to try a new approach -- I think AW should be a good fit for bridging the gap between his superficial play-habits (which seem totally great, as many have mentioned) and a more fruitful-to-everyone underlying motivation. AW makes it easy to care about in-fiction consequences, and it also makes it easy to do crazy fictional shit that has a lot of consequences. But right now it sounds like your friend isn't interested in the first half of that -- the consequences he's interested in aren't really related to the things inside the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324673/#Comment_324673" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T23:24:50+00:00" title="May 15, 2011 11:24PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>It sounds to me like he developed a way of guaranteeing his own fun in games that might not otherwise be fun, and that's turned into habit.

Given that you haven't gamed much with him, I wouldn't continue to game with him at the expense of enjoying yourself. If you value your friendship with him, find another activity to share with him. Or rotate games. 1 week boardgames which he is invited to. 1 week RPGs which he may or may not come to depending on if the game supports his play style. Or have 2 gaming nights, 1 where he can come and 1 where he can't. Maybe have him or someone else GM for the night he's in attendance. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>Dicking around was the term he used, you could swap the word messing for dicking if you'd like.

Tell him that the game won't work if we don\u2019t play these characters as if they were real people and doing otherwise would break the game. You know he loves to break games like video games, and that's totally cool, but the problem here is you personally need to do a lot of work to make the game happen so if we break it\u2026 it means you've wasted hours of your life for nothing and that would suck. You want to give this game a fair try which means playing by the rules. <br/><br/>Then give him the option to bow out. And tell him he can jump back in when you guys start a new game if it better supports what he wants out of gaming. Or ask him to start a second game night for boardgames. Or rotate weeks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324696/#Comment_324696" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T06:36:23+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  6:36AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why is it important to grow the RPG community?<br/><br/>This thread is why.

What does he hope to achieve?" (And make it clear that you're asking because you'd like to give it to him, not because you want to "block" his hopes. Answer positively, with encouragement: "Cool! I'd like to see that in action. Let's play it out and see what happens.")<br/><br/>Ask also things like, "OK, so your character just does these weird things? So how do the other people in the holding see him? Do they think he's crazy, do they enjoy his antics, do they fear him?"<br/><br/>Let him fill in the gaps you don't understand. When you don't understand something, just tell him, "OK, so how does [the hardholder] react to your shenanigans?" He might say, "Oh, he considers me his top agent provocateur, because he knows he can talk me easily into pulling some crazy stunts." And then you know what he wants from the game: have the hardholder instigate him into some oddball stunts.<br/><br/>I think then it'll be clear pretty fast whether he's hoping for something different from the game, or if he's just not really interested in playing a "story game" about real characters, and needs to play some video games or board games or something else instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324721/#Comment_324721" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T09:20:53+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  9:20AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

There's a lot of crazy fuckers out there that do shit for no reason. Though some folks seem to be suggesting that you hammer the guy when he acts out and that's just plain passive-aggressive bullshit GMing. Follow the rules for MCing.  It's not your job to punish him or make him miserable.<br/><br/>I agree with this. He sounds like he'd be a great AW player. If he plays a Saavyhead that just wants to dick around with tech, well, that's a pretty good fit for the setting. Maybe he's apathetic to everything but making crazy technology, and the other players have to deal with this if they want his help. Need aerial transport? Better figure out a way to make the Saavyhead think it's going to be fun!<br/><br/>I also agree that you shouldn't just respond with passive-aggressive dickery in-game. Anything you do in-game is going to be interpreted as coming from the game, not you. It sounds like your player is already okay with fucking with the game, so that approach is just going to frustrate you and bring you to inaccurate conclusions about this player's motivations.\n<blockquote><blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>I asked him if he could keep his dicking around to a minimum and his response was, "I can't promise that."</blockquote>\nThis to me would be a major warning sign. The OP<i>tried</i>to resolve things in a reasonable manner by honest discussion of his concerns, and got a jovial "screw you" in response.</blockquote>\nNo way! The OP asked the guy a question, which he responded to honestly. I don't think it was much of a "screw you". It was an honest appraisal of the request.<br/><br/>Really, if you don't like playing with this guy, don't invite him. Don't stonewall him, don't skirt around the issue, just be upfront about your concerns and your reasoning. "Hey man, this is how we're going to play and I don't think it's your bag. What do you think?" If your friendship can't handle that, then maybe you have bigger problems than roleplaying games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324722/#Comment_324722" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T09:32:30+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  9:32AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Ask also things like, "OK, so your character just does these weird things?

At that point you can start highlighting their lowest stats just to stop them from power gaming but that can lead to passive aggressiveness and other social problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it can become hard for the other players to <b>play their characters as if they are real</b>, when one of the PCs is a sociopath randomly killing people (and in AW these will be named people that your characters may know) but you ignore it (even though there is no way your character would) because that character in the fiction is played by another player.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I was in that game as a player and this was happening, I would try to deal with it outside of the game and if it didn't resolve\u2026 stop playing. Which brings up another question, are any of the other players bothered by this behavior? If they are, another thing to consider\u2026 are you sacrificing the fun of someone who actually wants to play AW to try to please someone who doesn't care?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt our next local gaming event, I'm going to tell the GMs that if they have a problem player to let our staff know asap. We will try to get them into a game that better suits their playing style. If that doesn\u2019t work, we will refund their money. Sometimes GMs at conventions will tolerate behavior that normally they wouldn't because, "this person paid to be here." But often the net result is by trying to please 1 person who paid to be there, you may end up ignoring the other 5 who aren't problems and also paid to be there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324730/#Comment_324730" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T10:34:37+00:00" title="May 16, 2011 10:34AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2011 10:35AM by agony.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Which brings up another question, are any of the other players bothered by this behavior?</blockquote>\nOne is, one is not, and one I am not sure about.  The dynamics of the group are a bit complex (like most groups I imagine), as we've been story-gamers for the past 5 years or so.  Due to real life our group has changed a bit and 3 of us are holdovers with 2 new players.  The 2 new players I did not previously know as they were college friends of one of the members.  <br><br>The 2 new guys have never played Indie games before and aren't necessarily on the same page.  The player this thread is about will probably never really be down player authorship and story-gaming but the other guy I feel like he is beginning to see the benefits.<br><br>One of the main issues is the friend of these two new guys used to be all into our playstyle and since these new-comers have arrived he's sort of evolved into seeking comedy and being goofy like the player who is "dicking around".  It's not the same but I can definitely feel the dynamics shifting and I'm not enjoying the games as much as I used to.<br><br>I think Jason and everyone else advocating that it probably won't work out or isn't worth the trouble are likely right.  Nevertheless, I think I owe it to the group to at least give it a go so we're starting our first session up on Wednesday.  I'm hoping for some common ground and we'll see what happens.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324738/#Comment_324738" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T11:30:03+00:00" title="May 16, 2011 11:30AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good luck!

You have characters like Belkar and Richard and Professor Farnsworth and Sokka who are silly in what are frequently some fairly solid and legitimate plots.  It's just a matter of figuring out where the character fits in the overall metastructure.  Do that and it's not hard to work with.  Though do make sure it's clear that there are some lines to be found, where folks are really going to kill his character for his antics not because you're trying to punish him, but because he just beat a man to death with his own arm in broad daylight for for putting pickles on his burger.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Why is it important to grow the RPG community?<br/><br/>This thread is why. Not everyone is compatible.<br/><br/>People grow up. People change. People move away. It can be difficult to maintain a gaming group\u2026 especially a functioning one where people enjoy similar things.<br/><br/>RPGs are like dating. If you marry the first person you date because the pool of potential dates is tiny\u2026 you know the rest! The divorce rate in America is already 40-50%, and that's with plenty of fish in the sea. In RPGs I've known people who have stayed together for 10-20 years even though they don't enjoy playing games together.</blockquote>\nNot everyone is compatible, no, but at the same time, you shouldn't be too hasty in writing folks off, particularly since in the vast majority of cases where you are incompatible, the final decision is likely to be mutual if you do your due diligence.<br/><br/>Too many folks are too quick to boot folks out of their group (and 'quick' in this case is not a measure of time, but of attempts that can be reasonably be expected to produce positive results), to the point where they never really reflect on what they actually want in favor of booting out anyone who remotely contradicts their mass of vague notions and end up with a rather monotonous, stagnant group.<br/><br/>Rather, working with someone who at first glance seems to have conflicting goals, then analyzing your own goals and helping the person in question analyze their own can help you greatly increase your understanding of what it is you truly want out of gaming, and realizing that on the most fundamental levels, you are not in conflict, from which point you learn to link your objectives for an overall richer gaming experience for all involved, and a healthier gaming community.  And if, in the end, that analysis ends with the revelation that goals really, fundamentally are in conflict?

Nothing wrong with that, that's why god created gaming conventions.  <br/><br/>For example, our group has a bunch of people who don't like narration-passing mechanics at all; we put a high priority on everyone at the table having fun, and so we just can't play games like Primetime Adventures or whatever because it makes everyone miserable.  But we've also got some people who adore PTA, so what happens is, the PTA-lovers go off and play it at cons or in some other group once in a while, and our regular weekend thing is reserved for the games we <i>all</i> enjoy.  No one is a jerk about it, no one claims that the person who doesn't like PTA is "horrible to deal with," we just focus on the things we have in common and enjoy that.  None of us are so obsessive that we can only have fun doing one thing (all D&amp;D all the time or whatever), so that gives us plenty of room to do all kinds of great things together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324805/#Comment_324805" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T16:20:44+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  4:20PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Ask also things like, "OK, so your character just does these weird things?

In which case they are a team, rather than a troll and victim.<br/><br/>Can you accept that dynamic &amp; try to find ways to highlight your player's strength that make it appealing, instead of just annoying?<br/><br/>Maybe have an NPC village be an uptight town &amp; the other player's character gets to be the prankster who arrives and teaches them to lighten up via dAdAism.<br/><br/>Heck, maybe your contrarian player can be convinced to be the straight man: present him with a senseless situation, such as One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest-- where nutty Jack Nicholson was, oddly-enough, the voice of sanity &amp; reason.  His antics were a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>All this is contingent on you being able to give the player enough benefit of the doubt to let them be too cool for school, like Cool Hand Luke. And you'll have to be willing to play the straw man.  If you can find it inside yourself to do-so, the player might really shine.  He might get-over whatever makes him act like that, too.  Heck, maybe you'll get a Han Solo arc, where he starts out too-cool-for-these-Force-nerds &amp; ends up staunchly affiliated.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_act"

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>Viletta, that's very nice, but I've read enough to be absolutely 100% certain that their goals really fundamentally are in conflict.<br/><br/>This isn't about indie vs. trad, by the way.  People like the dicking around guy are horrible to deal with in D&amp;D games of every stripe, too, or Vampire or GURPS or what-have-you.<br/><br/>It's like what jenskot said above\u2014the guy just doesn't care about fictional characters and worlds and is unable/unwilling to engage with the game world on that level.<br/><br/>Matt</blockquote>\nMeanwhile, I've read enough to know that you can't be 100% certain that their goals really, fundamentally are in conflict because I've played with that sort of player before, and managed to make them an asset.<br/><br/>You say the guy is unwilling or unable to engage the world?  Let's go with unable; the guy's apparently new at this.  Here's the thing.  Humans learn.  Especially when coming into something relatively fresh.  This guy can learn to engage the world in a more appropriate manner, and I've seen it happen.  Quickly, even.<br/><br/>The key is to get him invested in the world and the NPCs.  The key to getting him invested in NPCs is to know what he likes, what he's going for, and then give it to him through the NPCs.  This guy likes silly zaniness?  There are plenty of perfectly reasonable ways to bring that into an otherwise serious game.  In my case, I loves me some crazy witches, so I tossed a crazy witch doing all sorts of ridiculousness into the mix and my goof absolutely loved her.  Investment achieved.  Cue threatening of the crazy witch, and engagement with the world is achieved.  Huge step towards solving the problem, that.<br/><br/>And this guy is definitely worth it.  The whole, "Roleplaying is serious business," gig is all well and good, but it's always useful to have someone who will actually <i>do</i> something on their own accord if you don't want to have entire sessions with the party talking with the barkeep about family.  "I shoot the cultist," is awesome.  It's interesting, it's appropriate, it sets the tone, it complicates the situation, and solves the question of why the party's getting all wrapped up in this mess; they shot the ruddy cultist!  You can't tell me a player with enough chutzpah to wipe out a city isn't a magnificent asset, once properly framed and channeled.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324852/#Comment_324852" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T23:02:05+00:00" title="May 16, 2011 11:02PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was a problem player!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took me a few years to get past it.

So I gave him an intelligent sword that he could talk to. So when it wasn't his turn, he would roleplay his character and the sword talking to each other. It kept him busy and engaged!<br/>\n<br/>\nI make rules lawyers in charge of the rules except for rules governing their own character's actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the group has a mix of people who love and hate combat... I make everyone roll initiative... combat or not. Then everyone has 2 minutes to do anything. Roll attacks, explore, narrate flashbacks, have conversations. And I will design combats so that non-combat turns can influence combat indirectly. That way everyone does what they want while still working towards common goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone wants to power game, I have them focus their optimizing energy towards designing threats for the PCs!<br/>\n<br/>\nI've had players who just wanted to play assholes. So I asked them to play NPCs. I told them... go crazy... as long as you are ok with the PCs killing you. But if they do, you can just play a different NPC next time.

The first session was pretty damn good and the longstanding player who brought the dicking around player in was very serious and set a good example which lead the player this thread is about into doing the same.  He didn't dick around at all, sure, he was quirky but I like his character and he came up with some cool shit (he isolated a piece of the maelstrom onto a cassette tape and carved it into a belt on the Chopper's bike - like etching a vinyl record - to experiment).<br><br>He did withdraw a bit on some of the questions I asked and fell back on the note in the Savvyhead's playbook about taking -1HX with everyone because "you don't really have time to get to know them with all your other work going on."  He used this as an excuse to defer questions about the other players, like, "If you could only save one of the characters, who would it be?"  His answer was no one as he doesn't really know them very well.  We'll crack that though as the other players were working to engage him as well.  So, yeah, strange.  I guess my email combined with other players setting a good example really pushed this guy not to act out.  I hope it continues.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325298/#Comment_325298" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T05:45:17+00:00" title="May 19, 2011  5:45AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great, man!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325302/#Comment_325302" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T06:05:41+00:00" title="May 19, 2011  6:05AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No need to be embarrassed, this was an interesting thread that spawned good discussions.
