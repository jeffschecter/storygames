Now, if our weekly game has a session that takes a turn for the sad, that's fine with me...but if it's going to be an endless parade of sorrow, then I think I would eventually stop being entertained by it.  Something happier, on the other hand, is always welcome and will always remain entertaining: my capacity for happiness and joy is greater than my interest in misery, and I hope that this will always be true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249467/#Comment_249467" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-03T18:41:20+00:00" title="January  3, 2010  6:41PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in a Ribbon Drive game that was pretty much a downer in the end, very emotionally touching for me.

For me tragic stories are a reminder to not take for granted the value of life, but that doesn't really hit until there is time to reflect upon the story.<br/><br/>EDIT: Tragedies can be a powerful form of escapism, too (though not exclusively so). The ability to give messy situations a sense of inner logic is a powerful feature of story games/roleplaying games, making them an effective form of escapism.

They play games with a mixture of elements, where the resolutions are generally in favour of the PCs, and the endings are more or less happy ones.<br/><br/>When you talk about "sad little" games, or even "emotional" games, I figure most people think that means games that <i>are</i> soul crushing and masochistic -- where players deliberately make bad things happen to their characters, deliberately choose bad options, where the characters are all pathetic and unsympathetic and it all ends in tragedy, or some characters are sympathetic and get it even worse in the end.<br/><br/>And some games are like that, I guess, but I think most sad games aren't. Nicotine Girls gives you a fairly realistic portrayal of impoverished teenagers. They're not gonna fix all their problems by the end of one session. At best, they can make incremental progress, and you have to actually make plans to get it. Certainly, the <i>opportunity</i> is there to really make your character's life super-crappy, but it's not required. I haven't played it that way, and I actually like "soul crushing" in a game.<br/><br/>Also, rpgs do a curious thing with schadenfreude. You can like it when the GM pwns another player or player character, but when it's your character, it gets a bit wonky. Either you are advocated for your character's eventual triumph, in which case you have the experience of challenging and overcoming adversity, or you are directing your character's suffering (or fully complicit), in which case it crosses the line into vicarious self-destruction. That's when you know things have gotten really bad, and you need to go back to the vicarious genocide of people because they are "monsters" that have "treasure."

It is, however, based upon an assumption, that the character's survival/triumph over whatever threatens to end the character's story in tragedy is the only goal. Take Terribly Beautiful. The characters face a lot of obstacles: sexism, poverty and a deadly disease from which the game provides no escape. Their goal, however, isn't to fix sexism, become rich or survive, it's to be remembered. The game's goal is not directly derived from the major obstacles and conflicts. This is a third way to engage a tragic story in addition to the two I mentioned in a previous post, the reminder of the value of life and the emotional reassurance from escapism, none of which strike me as being schaudenfreude. Catharsis might be a fourth, and there are probably more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249624/#Comment_249624" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T00:16:03+00:00" title="January  5, 2010 12:16AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2010 12:16AM by JDCorley.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hans otterson</cite>For those who don't like games with sad, lonely little themes: I don't get this.

It's only the last sentence that is sarcastic. I am absolutely in favour of games about willfully self-destructive behaviour.<br/><br/>The game you describe is an example of triumph <i>in spite of</i> obstacles, as opposed to triumph <i>over</i> obstacles. There's definitely catharsis there, in both success and failure. And a high failure rate increases the value of success -- as, for example, the overwhelming power of monsters and the crap abilities of investigators in Call of Cthulhu makes it more of an achievement to make it out alive and sane. Although, I suspect a more mundane, less exciting game with a similar attrition rate might be less popular.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249656/#Comment_249656" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T09:16:49+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  9:16AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Potemkin</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: John Powell</cite>Yes, to both, but I'm probably not going to seek such a game out.</blockquote>\nI'm curious.

It can be said that a properly-run game of the old Vampire is very good, but no fun for me. Other than that, I'm ok with a great variety of different things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
