Polaris as a semi-shared-gming game strikes the right balance for me.</blockquote>\nAnother relevent thread is: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4496&amp;page=1#Item_32" rel="nofollow">GM as entertainer</a><br/><br/>Upon reflection, I think I might want to modify my position a bit. I think what's important to me is the ability to punt responsibility at any given instant in time. By responsibility, I mean anything "required" of me in the game, contributing ideas, strategically manipulating mechanics, moderating other people's behavior, etc. Sometimes I just want to take a breather and sit back and be entertained by the other players, without having to do anything in that particular instant.<br/><br/>I think this is why I don't like traditional GMing, and had some problems with GMing DitV and Producing PtA; but I do like Polaris and traditional playing. I think it also means why I'm apprehensive about doing 2-player RPGs. If I want to kick back and take a break in traditional game as a GM, either I have to bring the game to a halt and we all take a break, or I have to contrive to get the players to "just roleplay with each other" so I can sit back. There were games where my sole goal in life as a GM was to set up a situation so the players would be willing to roleplay their PC's talking to each other and not needing to talk to NPCs or use any game mechanics.<br/><br/> The one and only time I GMed DitV, I remember feeling very jealous when a player dropped out of a couple conflicts because he wanted to take a break, while I had to still keep on playing the adversaries. PTA has rules requiring the Producer to frame scenes, play secondary characters, and the like, and sometimes I just did not feel like doing these things. (I guess in theory I could of started to just refuse to do some of the functions and ask other players to do these roles, but that would of been slightly ad hoc.) So its not just a general reduction in GM responsibility, it's the existence of any unavoidable responsibilities at all that bother me.<br/><br/>As a trad player, however, I could often times at any given moment sit back and do nothing. (I also don't care much for regular tactically complex, high stakes combats, because sometimes I just don't feel like doing them). In Polaris, when I get tired of driving the story I can just say "and so it was," end the scene, and be moon for a scene. <br/><br/>Games which have pre-defined and static responsibilities are hazardous. Sometimes the person who has to do them doesn't want to, and sometimes they do them in a half-assed way. I'm almost tempted to say that pre-defined, static responsibilities are always a bad thing, something to be avoided in design if at all possible.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104222/#Comment_104222" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T18:48:20+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  6:48PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nifty.There have been a couple of posts recently where people yearn for more games that break up a typical GM's job into areas shared by the group. I like your use of 'punt'; it's much less passive than 'share'.<br/><br/>For example, I like to think I'm a good audience. TSOY's gift dice suit that role well, and I'm often happy taking a backseat. And every game needs an audience. As Ron pointed out, not every PC in Contenders ends up a protagonist. <br/><br/>There's lots of other jobs to be done too.<br/><br/>Quite a few of my recent doodles have tried to break down responsibilities, and like you say, it's hazardous. In one design, <i>Era</i>, the players pick two favorite time periods each. They become the <i>warden </i>for that period when play happens in it - they're the bar for suspension of disbelief, and they're the source of authenticity. That's all fine. But are they then allowed to play in the period they manage? Pfft.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104263/#Comment_104263" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T04:34:49+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  4:34AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's room for flexibility - I know in my gaming we pawn off NPCs all the time, and there are plenty of scenes in PTA that I, as Producer, either don't frame or assign somebody to play a major NPC in.<br/><br/>CLINTON:  I want my guy to go see Carl Nguyen and settle his hash.<br/>ME:  Great, you are at the Bond Hill Banh Mi shop during the lunch rush.
