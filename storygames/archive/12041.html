Especially the emotional connection thing - many of the things in D&amp;D are actually then things that we learned to consider signs of low-quality hack fantasy in my youth, so these games are definitely not getting any bonus nostalgia points from me.<br/><br/>My judgment is that the average old school game system provides assist for your interests in the way the game characterizes the player and GM roles and tasks and goals in play. Note that this is not mechanical support, so it's easy to miss if you're used to only considering game mechanics. Regardless, I find that the underlying model of interaction has under-appreciated power for exactly the sort of thing you suggest: the GM of this sort of game gets to invent loads of backstory, and he gets to have the players interact with it intensely. This works very well because the underlying assumptions of prep and play do not have a bias for story - the GM is not responsible for causing a story to occur, and there is no pre-planned consideration for how the players have to interact with your prepped content. This reaches into the fictional set-up as well, definitely: the whole concept of dungeon-delving is all about exploring the GM's prep and interacting with it to find out what it does.<br/><br/>Thus my answer is two-fold: on the one hand there is very little in the way of useful mechanics in your average old school game to actually aid you, but the basic set-up of who does what is very useful from your viewpoint. My own answer to this conundrum has been to mostly ignore the specific mechanical tradition while utilizing the theoretical precepts underlying it to build a game tailored to my quirks as a GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269611/#Comment_269611" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-01T08:22:31+00:00" title="May  1, 2010  8:22AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is currently being coined as old school is like a siren's call to me. The fiction they draw inspiration from, the art they revere, the delicious prep-work, the way their fantasy rejects the influences of Tolkien and anime that dominate modern fantasy, all of this and more sings a heartbreakingly beautiful song to me. It's so seductive.<br/><br/>But in the end, these are the same systems that made the same promises to me almost 30 years ago and have, in the intervening decades, never fulfilled that promise. It may work for you. It certainly seems to have worked for many. But there are very specific reasons why they don't work for me.<br/><br/>Fortunately, they don't have to work for me. I've got my own way of getting there, and I can turn to these gems for inspiration; which, it turns out, is what they do best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269656/#Comment_269656" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-01T18:44:49+00:00" title="May  1, 2010  6:44PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2010 9:26PM by PaulCzege.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ry,<br/><br/>My current interest in Dragons at Dawn (<a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/apriorcrs/product/dragonsatdawn" rel="nofollow">pdf</a>, <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/dragons-at-dawn/10305162" rel="nofollow">print</a>) is partly driven by something I took from an IM conversation with Sean "Calithena" Stidd a few weeks ago about OD&amp;D and early RPGs. One of the characteristics of the games is that players were often pretty chuffed by "we didn't roll the dice once" sessions. And I realized that whether it was a conscious design goal or not, the games have an interesting design paradigm that works toward the desired "didn't roll dice" session over time.<br/><br/>Modern indie games front-load a player's engagement with the thematic material of play by making it a requirement going into chargen. (Ron Edwards says this all the time: that players have to want to play "this game" with "these people" from the outset.) OD&amp;D and early RPGs were different. They gave players something to do (kill shit, level up, complete quests, etc.) that was maybe adventurous but not particularly thematic, and then sometimes, over time, players developed through play a deeper affinity for their characters, and as a result, a knowledge of what they wanted to do thematically with them. And then you get the all roleplay, all character drama sessions, because play has moved beyond the system of the game text.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269663/#Comment_269663" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-01T20:37:54+00:00" title="May  1, 2010  8:37PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Been there, done that, burned out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269664/#Comment_269664" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-01T20:39:44+00:00" title="May  1, 2010  8:39PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ry,<br/><br/>Since I know you in person and we've (sort of) discussed this before, I will throw in my two cents:<br/><br/>1. The whole dreaming up stuff for the players to explore and then them discovering old secrets, etc, is perfectly suited by many of those old-school games. The way the rules work (or don't work) can really add to the mystery and danger of the whole thing in a way that many "modern" games do not. <br/><br/>Also, if the players have some of that nostalgia themselves, it may enhance the experience for them, too.<br/><br/>2. It's going to be really hard to avoid that "taking an hour to open a door" thing. The people I know who play OSR-style dungeon crawls on a regular basis have a total blast with it, but even they admit that they regularly get mired down in paranoid searches for traps or arguments about how to open a certain door, etc.<br/><br/>You might be able to build in a rule of some sort to avoid this (David Berg's "pacing dial" is a good solution for 90% of those problems), or find an explicit social agreement that allows you to avoid it.<br/><br/>3. The games may or may not help you do the heavy lifting as a GM, depending on what you're interested in (like that "didn't roll dice" phenomenon Paul describes: there's no support for it in the game itself, right--so you all have to work together to make it happen, and, more often than not, the brunt of that work falls on the GM's shoulders). I know that _I_ would be extremely tempted to tag on some Keys or some other kind of flagging to help push that along.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269673/#Comment_269673" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-01T22:38:43+00:00" title="May  1, 2010 10:38PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2010 10:43PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ry</cite>I love when the players are exploring something I made for them:<br/>. . . <br/>- Playing around with a new magic item, figuring out what it does and how it can be used<br/>. . .<br/>But:<br/>- Taking an hour to open a door DRIVES ME INSANE.</blockquote>I am so with you on this.  As a player, I've realized that what I like is the discovery, and maybe a little suspense and conflict leading up to that payoff.  But I don't actually need to <i>earn</i> it.  The GM needn't challenge me with hour-eating puzzles.  He just needs allow me to feel cool about doing the discovery.  What does it take for me to feel cool?  Usually, not much.  Example: using a Skill my character is particularly strong in.<br/><br/>As a GM, to provide this sort of experience for this sort of player, you just need to set the obstacles around your magic item accordingly.  Stick it (or perhaps a key to using it) behind a fun-to-kill monster, guard it with a Find-and-Remove-able trap, decorate it with symbolic instructions the players can easily interpret, etc.<br/><br/>(On the other hand, if you <i>like</i> challenging players, and your players <i>like</i> being challenged, then there must be something specifically lame about Door Puzzles, so maybe try a verbal riddle or spatial geometry challenge instead?)<br/><br/>As for game systems, I don't know any that help you create fun-to-discover setting features <i>and</i> help you reveal them in the way I've described.  So I guess that leaves inspiration and basic player/GM role, as discussed above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269686/#Comment_269686" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-02T04:25:47+00:00" title="May  2, 2010  4:25AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I know that _I_ would be extremely tempted to tag on some Keys or some other kind of flagging to help push that along.</blockquote>I was thinking that if I explicitly give no XP for monsters but have set xp like this...<br/><br/>100 XP - find a secret door<br/>200 - XP - survive an encounter with a new kind of monster<br/>500 - XP - find a new kind of magic item<br/>1000 XP - find a secret room<br/>1000 XP - visit a region you've never visited<br/><br/>... or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269687/#Comment_269687" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-02T04:26:27+00:00" title="May  2, 2010  4:26AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>Been there, done that, burned out.</blockquote>I've also burned out trying, but I was trying with 4e which adds a whole layer of work on top of everything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269688/#Comment_269688" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-02T05:19:13+00:00" title="May  2, 2010  5:19AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We'e playing Owl Hoot Trail at the moment.

Dave's approach (in the post above) suggests a game where failure is not really on the table: the point of the game is to explore and reveal new places and new information, and challenge is not an aspect of that exploration. In this case, you'll need some system in place to assure that (Dave's game Delve uses "soft" GM skills and techniques for this; but obviously mechanical methods for this sort of thing exist, too).<br/><br/>If you DO want challenge to be an aspect (e.g. there are areas in the world that are too dangerous FOR NOW) and you like old-school-type mechanics, one possible solution would be a clear option for "what happens when the characters fail". In failing to explore something or defeat a certain monster, the outcome should be something like "the characters have to run home fearfully" with a possible "leaving important/valuable stuff behind", depending on how painful you want failure to be. The old-school solution, as far as I can tell, was either to accept common character death and a "reboot" of the failed adventure as a feature of play, or to have a large group/stable of character explorers, so that any time you died you could just start playing another character ("hireling") in the group, allowing the game to keep moving from the same point.<br/><br/>Are you looking for a game of "exploration coloured by various challenges that are [almost] always overcome", or a game that challenges the players more intensely, with a constant possibility of failure? You'd have to rig an old-school game pretty hard to get the former, I think.<br/><br/>Are you familiar with Storming the Wizard's Tower? It offers gameplay very much in the vein of what we're discussing in this thread. (Heck, maybe we could play it together sometime--I'd be happy to play or run that game.) It gives you a group of characters and almost non-existent character death: rather, "failure" means that your character has to "sit out" the next session, while you play someone else from the group. This means "death" is a sort of experience penalty: the character sits out a session and doesn't advance. It also has a clever mix of mechanics (very similar to Apocalypse World) that pretty much guarantee that information (and thus revelation/discovery) flows constantly from the GM to the players, while maintain a sense of adversity and challenge.<br/><br/>I think the "read a [blank]" moves from Apocalypse World and the information-gathering and social rolls from Storming are very good tools for this sort of play. I don't think the Apocalypse World/Apocalypse D&amp;D principles, etc, are well-suited to what you're looking for, but some of the tools in there might be perfect for what you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269813/#Comment_269813" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-03T09:51:53+00:00" title="May  3, 2010  9:51AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Are you looking for a game of "exploration coloured by various challenges that are [almost] always overcome", or a game that challenges the players more intensely, with a constant possibility of failure? </blockquote>I want challenges to serve to make the exploration even sweeter, and to be a factor in their choices.  <br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>A: "I want to go to the Valley of a Thousand Stabs and find out the what Bleeding Head's prophecy was!"  <br/>B: "If we go to that valley we're probably going to die.

That's not a principle, it's just advice. But if you're making an exporation-based game, this is a lynchpin.<br/><br/>What the prep demands includes your front and threats. In AW, that's what you're exploring. For example, a front could be the ash wastes. A threat could be the radiation ruins in the center of the waste, the next of killer irradiated giant bugs that lives there, and the cache of old technology. In AW the GM preps a bunch of stuff that the players don't see at first and might never see.<br/><br/>That's not the only kind of thing you do in AW. You can also hang around the compound dealing with the people and the fuckery there. That's probably not the kind of exploration you're looking for. There's a style slider here that can be adjusted to fit your group.<br/><br/>How the mechanics support exploration is most clear through the reading moves. These moves are an open invitation to the players to say to the MC "Tell me more about this world I'm exploring", and for the GM to respond in kind. Opening your mind is also an invitation to explore, because it reveals things about the GM's prep. When you open up this move later, you gain a chance to glimpse the big secrets behind the world! That's really, really awesome.<br/><br/>Something I've noticed playing AW, is that there are times when we just sit around and talk about the world, explore the setting, and come to a more refined understanding of what things are like in this world--what they look like, feel like, how they act. In playing with some of the same players for almost 10 years across a few dozen systems, we've never played a system that created that experience for us.<br/><br/>I'm not saying all this because I think AW is exactly the system you want, or becuase I think it's the perfect system for everything, but I do think it sheds a lot of light on exploration play and how to make it happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269822/#Comment_269822" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-03T10:56:41+00:00" title="May  3, 2010 10:56AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, THAT was a great answer, Tony.

Like, when the characters and players first learn about these things, it's not just "the Dragon's Lair," it's "The lair of the Wyrm who laid desolate three kingdoms," or "The Court Magician of a petty king, recently possessed of an artifact of Power." That way you've got an idea of whether a threat will eat you for breakfast or fold like laundry.<br/><br/>The group can develop a rough lexicon of threat, too, so you can say "this one might outclass you a little, but be overcome with a little trickery or luck" without saying "Class 2 Obstacle, Strong against Force, Weak against Subterfuge." Interestingly, two of the principles of Apocalypse World are "make your Move, but never speak its name," and "make your Move, but misdirect." So a theoretical game system could very well delineate threats like Cl2 Ob, St:Force, Wk: Subterfuge, but you never say that to the players; you express those factors in natural language that helps bolster the feeling that they the characters sussed out the threat of the Dread Wyrm, as opposed to they the characters sussing the threat of the Class 2 Obstacle.<br/><br/>Of course, this <i>won't</i> be an exact science, so as you say, to find out for sure they'll have to check it out. And that's where a system like the reading and info gathering rolls Paul mentioned would come in, letting the players ask questions about the world and get answers, and still forming their knowledge more or less in-character and preserving that sense of discovery and wonder Ryan's seeking.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269893/#Comment_269893" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T07:18:37+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  7:18AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>You might be able to build in a rule of some sort to avoid this (David Berg's "pacing dial" is a good solution for 90% of those problems), or find an explicit social agreement that allows you to avoid it.<br/></blockquote>\nIs there a thread that describes in depth this "pacing dial" on s-g?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269895/#Comment_269895" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T07:37:00+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  7:37AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2010 7:38AM by Ry.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: boulet</cite>Is there a thread that describes in depth this "pacing dial" on s-g?</blockquote>Why, that's discusion number 9069! <br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9069" rel="nofollow">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9069</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269901/#Comment_269901" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T08:24:11+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  8:24AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: veritascitor</cite><br/>[...] they have to go there and find out for themselves how dangerous these places are, but should have a chance to escape and return another day.</blockquote>\nThis would get my vote!<br/><br/>Although the GM can also do this through in-fiction cues ("Ooh, it's really dangerous... you see the corpses of 50 knights smoldering among the wreckage...").

You WILL be killed by wolves or acolytes or mountain lions in the middle of a dungeon.  You only invest in the characters AFTER they've leveled up a bit.  Initially PCs don't need much in the way of backgrounds or elaborate goals and motivations because some of them will die.<br/><br/>But there are lots of ways to mitigate this and, I suspect, its one of the things that has been done as a house rule since D&amp;D was first being played:  Give them more HP.  Give them more healing (like 4E).  Start them at 3rd level etc.<br/><br/>I also understand the frustration with opening doors but those are meant to serve as a timing mechanism in the dungeon.  The longer you hang around the more likely wandering monsters are going to show up and hurt you.  The rules make clear that keeping track of time is essential to running the game.  If you're not using wandering monsters there's not much point to the whole stuck door thing though.<br/><br/>If you're doing it right though you should be doing basically be doing what was described in Vincent's advice above.  The GM just plays the dungeon without trying to "get" the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270005/#Comment_270005" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T23:40:45+00:00" title="May  4, 2010 11:40PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I am handling the "player chooses risk" is to give them an idea of the level of the danger - within a range - and a whole lot of options of varying levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a "player's map" and I write down the names of the geographic areas - "Gardbury Downs" - as well as the general level - "Lvl 3".  The players know that everything in there is near level 3, based on a random roll on a table (which they have access to).  They pick a quest based on some rumours from the area that provides a risk level they want to take, and I tell them the specific level of the Quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they are on a Quest that has a level much higher than their own, players would probably be well-advised to "take an hour opening a door", since the consequences of a trap or a trick are going to be worse and more likely to "hit" them.  All that means is that players who choose to take on greater risk will be more cautious.  The rewards are going to be greater, though, once again based on the level of the risk.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question I am struggling with now is whether or not to tie access to Daily Powers to specific Quests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270051/#Comment_270051" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T08:12:06+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  8:12AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Ryan is referring to "taking an hour" of Real Time, more so than it being an issue of in-game pacing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270070/#Comment_270070" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T10:11:25+00:00" title="May  5, 2010 10:11AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ry, I hope you are reading Jeff Rients blog.

Do you have any other specific favourite posts, particularly relevant to this thread? I would enjoy reading those, too, as I'm working on a OSR-style game right now.<br><br>The post you linked to also illustrates a few cool things:<br><br>* Discovering stuff/making stuff up in play together is lots of fun. The GM didn't plan this out; it's emergent in play from the group's creativity. I think that's a major part of the "old-school" mindset.<br><br>There are places where working in some "indie" mechanics and the like might be very useful. For instance, I would much rather use something like "Roll for Shoes" (links here: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11348" rel="nofollow">1</a>, and <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11790" rel="nofollow">2</a>) than the proposed "when you level up" mechanic. It's even more organic and surprising, plus it gives us a much more interesting place from which to figure out what its power is, as well as default mechanical weight for the new powers that grows in power level as you play. I think it's cooler to find out that your sword kills Ogres really well when you actually split its skull than at the end of the session, when you add up XPs.<br><br/>* For Ryan, note the "later, they die" comment at the end.

That said, two versions of D&amp;D; that are good teachers:<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that the 1974 edition of D&amp;D; (aka OD&amp;D;) emphasizes the mindset of wide-open exploration because the text itself is fragmentary and mysterious: it's like a funhouse dungeon where no meaning is spoonfed or without paradox. OD&amp;D; forces you to DIY and gives you lots of oracular tools: who lives in that castle? a (roll) evil high priest with (roll) six griffons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 1981 Moldvay edition is less far-out, but a clearer guide to those mysteries it does initiate you into. Here's a clear procedure for an encounter with that priest: first you roll his reaction roll, then if combat ensues here's who goes first, then if his side takes a casualty here's how you roll for morale.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally find it best to use Moldvay's explanations as a way of making sense of OD&amp;D;'s text, which is more wahoo (among other things because it goes past 3rd level). Okay, now the PCs have encountered the evil high priest. Whoa, there's a 1 in 3 chance that he responds favorably? And if he does fight and wins initiative, his likeliest response is to charm them all and send them off on some quest? Or if that fails and a fight breaks out, the outcome is still unpredictable (despite the difference in power levels) because he might turn and run, surrender, or parley on a failed morale check?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sense of surprise is very unlike any other style of play in my experience (although I haven't yet played any of the things folks here are doing in response to their own explorations of this mindset). In later editions of D&amp;D; you're like "the EHP is here to challenge the PCs;" in my storygame experience you're like "the EHP is here to set up a conflict." Here you can't know what he's there for until the dice start giving you some hints!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a DM I enjoy this because<br/>\n- I'm not in charge; I'm just helping the group as a referee of the strange and adventurous events that the PC's actions generate<br/>\n- I get to use the same creative problem-solving-on-the-fly skills I would as a player. A pegasus comes along as a wandering monster; the players have to think fast "what tools has the fiction given us to deal with this" and I have to think equally fast "what tools has the fiction given me to explain this and work it into the context?"<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a player I enjoy this because<br/>\n- I like the sense of a world existing independently of me; I hate thinking "what does the DM want me to do next to keep the adventure going" and am reassured to see that the DM is well-equipped with tools and approaches to make adventure happen in front of my eyes with a handful of dice<br/>\n- the fact that things aren't set in stone gives me a sense of latitude; I can be a partner in helping the DM make sense of things because if I invent "my guy used to be a pegasus trainer" there's a good chance the DM will latch onto that as a meaning rather than rejecting it in favor of something pre-determined<br/>\n<br/>\nFor blogs in general I'd recommend going back and reading the first six months or so of Grognardia, where he's kind of laying things out; specific posts at The Mule Abides, where I post, are James' about <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2010/04/22/as-it-was-in-grand-mothlam/" rel="nofollow">Vancian casting</a> and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2010/04/04/theres-experience-in-them-thar-hills/" rel="nofollow">XP for treasure</a>; mine about <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2009/11/10/tell-me-how-to-play-4e-and-odd-so-i-can-ignore-it/" rel="nofollow">player advice</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/dd-was-a-wargame-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means/" rel="nofollow">wargaming roots</a>, and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/random-events-make-you-say-yes-to-links/" rel="nofollow">random inspiration</a> (also in a longer version in Fight On! #8), and Eric's on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2010/04/13/trenches-and-getaway-cars/" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D; as a war movie</a> and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2010/03/09/mastering-morale-know-when-to-fold-em/" rel="nofollow">morale</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270930/#Comment_270930" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T09:00:46+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  9:00AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, Ryan. I was just rereading some three-year old threads about D&amp;D and I think I know at least one way you could do your exploratory thing with old-school D&amp;D.<br><br>* The main characters of the game are powerful older dudes who live in the Town. They're rich, retired, incredibly knowledgeable, whatever. And they want to explore the unexplored, the frontiers of the land, perhaps in search for something specific (the search for immortality?), perhaps just for wealth and/or curiosity. Each such character might have their own purposes, for more interest.<br><br>* So, these older dudes, too old to go adventuring themselves, hang out at the Tavern with some sketchy treasure map, and look to hire young "adventurers" to send out into the beyond. Just like all those bad plot hooks we know and love from D&amp;D, except the old guy doesn't die after handing over the map.<br><br>* Each such character has a certain amount of money, which he/she can use to hire those adventurers. The adventurers, of course, sign a contract to keep half the treasure they bring back, or whatever.<br><br>* The GM rolls up some adventurers (doesn't take long, in OD&amp;D, although I would want a little more character to those characters, if you know what I mean), then the old guys in the tavern interview them and hire a bunch. They send them out to various locations, to map, explore, and plunder them.<br><br>* As they get more money, they can afford to hire more henchmen, better henchmen, and arm/equip their henchmen with better tools. If they're unsuccessful, they die, and they have to scramble for more untrained guys. But over time, they have a certain "stable" of adventurers they can send forth to doom or glory. <br><br>* On the actual adventure, the players take over the roles of the henchmen, of course, maybe even several each. But we all know they're likely to die; no problem there!<br><br>* These old guys might have some funky powers and/or resources/magical items. One important one might be various types of scrying/divination, which allow them to know what their hirelings are up to, see what they're exploring, make sure they're not lying about what they found, etc.<br><br>* But other powers might be gifts they can bestow upon their hirelings to make them less pathetic, and to give them a fighting chance. Say you have a powerful magic sword you found in some cavern. For the next expedition, you'll have to decide: which adventurer will you give it to? Do they need it for this venture? Or maybe it's too likely they'll all die, so you'd rather keep the sword for fear of losing it to that dungeon. Or maybe you can cut off a finger from one of your hands and give an adventurer the ability to breathe fire, or become invulnerable to poison. Will you do it? How many times? And who's the lucky adventurer? Now, will you send him into the most dangerous dungeons, or use him carefully on missions where the threat level is lower?<br><br>So, there you go. What do you think? Dealing with the common death issue as a feature of play could help avoid the two problems you've outlined, and allows the players to stay in play and keep exploring the same lands even if death is commonplace.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270941/#Comment_270941" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T10:38:06+00:00" title="May 13, 2010 10:38AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, that sounds super fun.  <br/><br/>So, let's say we have 4 players and 1 GM.  The GM makes up a bunch of dungeon leads ("an abandoned mine with rumored riches", etc.).  The 4 players play their Boss characters and decide on a dungeon to pursue, then put out the call for help and await response.  The GM makes up some 1st level characters and roleplays them interacting with the 4 Bosses.  The 4 Bosses then pick however many Lackeys.<br/><br/>Now the GM cedes control of the Lackeys to the players, who divvy up control as they see fit.  The GM runs the dungeon, the players charge at it with their expendable Lackeys.  The players probably don't get too attached to the Lackeys; when they see a cool thing in the dungeon, they probably think, "Oh neat, my Boss character would love to have that!"  The Lackeys are thus played more or less as extensions of the Bosses' will, with no double-crossing on the table.<br/><br/>Is that what you had in mind?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Are old-school systems good for me? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12041/are-old-school-systems-good-for-me/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Are old-school systems good for me? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12041/are-old-school-systems-good-for-me/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Yeah, exactly, Dave.

and story elements. Maybe those lackeys run off with loot, simply, leaving the Boss with a failure--and are now effectively NPCs. Or maybe they just switch their allegiance to a different Boss. But that's kind of getting into "advanced play" territory, like "how to change up the game once you're bored with it".<br/><br/>As for the "bunch of dungeon leads", in the context of Ryan's thread, I know that he's into the West Marches approach, where the GM actually defines a whole swath of land to explore, and the explorers simply tell him where they want to go--each session they approach the GM with a plan "We're mounting an expedition into the Wastes of Blah", and the GM stats up that area of the unexplored land.<br/><br/>I'm also not 100% sure about the 1 Boss per player idea--it could be done any number of ways. And each brings a potential variation: for instance, maybe you only get to play the adventurers you've hired, in which case the GM can try to sneak funny or undesirable traits into the mix and see if they get through the interview. (Boss powers might also include abilities to get more information about their employees, like mind-reading or whatever.) Or maybe you always play the hirelings of other Bosses, so then you get to create and/or play out some of those quirks. Many possibilities there.<br/><br/>But the whole "Oh neat, my Boss character would love to have that!" ... and "is it worth risking this Lackey to get it" is the meat of play in this idea. It could be even more interesting if the different Bosses have different interests/motivations--one is collecting magical ingredients for a ritual to gain a new power he can bestow onto the hirelings, another is gathering money to buy his guys armour, and so on. Then you can have some fun play where a hireling who spots something his Boss wants might try to trick another hireling to go after it. Sometimes he'll then take it over his dead body (whether stabbed in the back or caught by a trap), and sometimes they'll work together for their own survival, hoping that the other Bosses won't be fighting over this Guffin, and will just let his Boss have it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270955/#Comment_270955" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T11:18:04+00:00" title="May 13, 2010 11:18AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2010 11:20AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the basic idea; curious to see Ryan's take!

Apparently in this trope, you 'manage' a party of students with training and what not, and then send them into dungeons. I immediately suggested a business outfit (like Acquisitions, Inc from Penny Arcade/PvP's D&amp;D podcasts), so I was closer to your concept here (so yeah, I'm digging on it)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway! The reason I bring this up, is that in his proposed computer game, you set up your characters, but then they go on 'auto-pilot' in the dungeon, rather than being a 100% controlled dungeon hack. Now, I'm not suggesting that extreme, cos we're talking dungeon hacking here. But a concept he has is that each character has a 'personality trait' that modifies a check for how they react to a post-battle sequence (rest, press on, heal, whatever). This got me thinking about the 'potential to backstab' here, and I think that you could handle that (if you wanted that element) as something randomized, but influenced by factors the player controls as the 'boss' (amount of pay, the hireling's "reliability" rating, or whatever). I think that'd jive nicely with the above discussed random elements generating discovery.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, over on the praxis forum there's a nice thread going on about Apocalypse D&amp;D (a mashup of old school D&amp;D and Apocalypse World) that hits on some similar topics and shows a pretty interesting take on using brand-new design to get old school results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271002/#Comment_271002" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T13:38:35+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  1:38PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, that game setup is genius.

Then it makes it much more interesting for other players to try to misrepresent under-qualified "adventurers" in the interview process. As Dave mentions, since you spend more time in the dungeon than playing the Boss, you're still going to play those characters to the hilt. But when it's your turn as Boss, you effectively get to decide where the adventure is going, so it's also a big deal if you're not doing very well: it's terribly embarassing to have your adventurers dying in the nearby swamp when your friend's Boss is sending his seasoned hirelings into the Mountains of Doom. (Except we all get to play out all the adventures, so it's good fun anyway.)<br/><br/>Ryan,<br/><br/>Spill the beans!

But I don't actually need to earn it. The GM [...] just needs allow me to feel cool about doing the discovery. What does it take for me to feel cool? Usually, not much. </i><br/><br/>And then I was riffing off of Paul and I said:<br/><br/><i>      I was thinking that if I explicitly give no XP for monsters but have set xp like this...<br/><br/>      100 XP - find a secret door<br/>      200 - XP - survive an encounter with a new kind of monster<br/>      500 - XP - find a new kind of magic item<br/>      1000 XP - find a secret room<br/>      1000 XP - visit a region you've never visited</i><br/><br/>and later talking about rules vs. what Jason said I said:<br/> <i>If the game has lots of ways to survive and each new exploration leads to the next power (and powers are so cool it's saliva-inducing), then players are more likely to explore and GO for it.</i><br/><br/>Responding to Mike I said:<br/><i>There's only one party I want, and that's one that wants to discover a bunch of stuff. So the XP list will always be the same (with my various ways to reward exploration). Individual PCs might have different key-like things, probably to gain action points instead of XP.</i><br/><br/>Paul basically summed up the design challenge:<br/><br/><i>      * A system which allows the GM to create a "consistent reality" and then arbitrate resolutions based on his prep and impartial guidelines.<br/>          * The system *also* presents enough support to encourage the players to explore challenges freely without too much fear of death or failure.</i><br/><br/>I know I'm up to that challenge because three years ago I wrote a game that does the second one, but used it the wrong way.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12041/are-old-school-systems-good-for-me" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12041/are-old-school-systems-good-for-me" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12041/are-old-school-systems-good-for-me/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12041%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12041%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
