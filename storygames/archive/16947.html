She's trying to raise enough now to commission a dozen new pieces from the illustrator, Claudia Cangini, to include as pre-made courtiers for convention or LARP games.<br/><br/>But what I'm here to say is, food! One of the reward levels features a booklet of recipes collected and adapted by me, customized for you, and I'm excited about it, and it's not getting quite all the love I think it deserves. Here's the writeup:\n<blockquote><b>The Sultan's Own Chef</b><br/><br/><b>A Thousand and One Nights</b> is a sensual game. As the Sultan's Own Chef, you have a unique opportunity to make your game night into an occasion to remember. This reward includes a booklet of fitting recipes, collected and adapted by Vincent Baker, to create several delightful feasts or one true extravaganza. Shown here: Persian rice with saffron, pistachios and sultanas; butter beans with herbs and golden tomatoes; butternut squash with caramelized small onions and almonds; and a salad of artichokes, oranges and black olives.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://nightskygames.com/1001/finished.jpg"/></blockquote>\nBy default, the recipes will be vegetarian &amp; vegan, and I'll add meat dishes if you want, or make sure to include only gluten-free dishes, or whatever you need. One of the things I'm doing is giving the principles of the dish, then a specific recipe, then suggested variations, so that you can easily adapt the dishes yourself. You can see what I'm talking about here, for example: <a href="http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/333793/files/20120716123430-PersianRice.pdf?1342467281" rel="nofollow">Persian Rice (pdf)</a>. This is the way I cook myself, and I'm having a lot of fun thinking about the recipes this way.<br/><br/>Check it out if you want to!
