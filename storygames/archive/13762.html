With practice.<br/><br/>I haven't played Misery Bubblegum but I can tell you that the flow gets much better with Archipelago II with practice and with players who've played together before.  I didn't provide enough example before our Venetian game and may not have explained the Resolution card protocols as well as I have previously with LitToS, a game I've played several times now.  I noticed fewer declarative statements in our game than I've seen in other freeform-ish games and it was often me jumping in to point out the conflict.  And because I wasn't saying "That Might Not Be So Easy" immediately after someone saying something like "And then I (Lucia) seduce Stephano and he wakes up in my chambers," we had to then break up play a bit to fix who was the actor in question.  If there's no declarative statement you have to figure our who the "I" is before "Yes, but" or "No, and", for example, can be interpreted without confusion.<br/><br/>In repeated Love in the Time of Sei\xf0 games I've seen myself, by way of example, and then others add a forceful intonation to a narrated sentence that I/we fully expect to be challenged by TMNBSE.<br/><br/>Also it's so fun watching guys like Jackson or Johnzo chew the scenery that I may have not stepped in as facilitator/editor as quickly as I might usually.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Not trying to negate/de-rail your query.

The other PC can maybe hinder if they know (Hx) the more aggresive PC well, but they're probably at a disadvantage for having not taken the initiative in the mechanical part of the conflict.<br/><br/>That might be impossible to emmulate with straight freeform but with freeform + resolution cards it might be difficult but possible to do in some way.  Like maybe some portion of the cards have two possible outcomes and the player that provoked the TMNBSE statement gets their choice of between the two outcomes.<br/><br/>Or maybe you silently take a chip every time you provoke conflict in a scene and you can turn in two chips for a resolution card re-draw if the first one doesn't appeal.<br/><br/>Still pretty freeform, but adds some conflict incentives.  These thoughts are more in service of driving towards declarative statements than helping the flow.<br/><br/>LitToS has some pretty good scene examples.  I should have looked at those before our game and read a couple.

You can make a social cue, though, because it is predicated on trust. I was writing about this for (cough) a thing I'm working on just yesterday:<br/><br/>You need to be confident that your table-mates are bringing the same enthusiasm, energy and devilish creativity to the game that you are. Everybody wants to succeed, and shared fun is the metric of that success.<br/><br/>You also need to be confident in your own native genius. You know how to tell a story, you know how to work with others, take turns and follow rules, and you know what you like. That is more than enough!<br/><br/>So you trust your table, you are brimming with self-confidence, and you are primed and ready to have fun. The rest is gravy.<br/><br/>If you trust the people you are playing with, you know that as brilliant players themselves they are going to introduce really juicy stuff to the game. Crazy, unexpected stuff that is absolutely going to throw you for a loop.<br/><br/>This is called generosity. You had ideas for your little dude, and even better ideas for their little dudes, but all that is going to change, fast - you've been given a gift. The wild ideas that have upset your own apple cart are the building blocks you get to use to make things even more fun. Pretty soon you'll be giving gifts of your own.<br/><br/>If you're confident in yourself, you know that you can roll with the punches with the best of them.<br/><br/>This is called agreement. That crazy, unexpected stuff? You're going to take that, build on it, and give as good as you get. "Yes," you'll say, "<i>and</i>..." Pretty soon people will be agreeing to your contributions, <i>and </i>... you see where this is going?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311706/#Comment_311706" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T11:32:22+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 11:32AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's good - but what in particular I was looking for was expressing that that applies to dialog as well.

One way we approached it was to say, "Okay, let's take this scene further, past where we've talked about this and made a decision." If there was a problem with that, then there was a problem with the words - the proposed decision - which led to us resolving the scene. If there wasn't, then we could get to whatever it was that this scene was actually about. What you might be less happy with is the notion that you're breaking character here to do such a thing. There's not much that can help with that. I think it's like coming up for air. You take your bearing, figure out if this is the end of the scene, and then if not, dive back under for more role-playing. Sometimes one OCC question is worth ten minutes of in-character arguments.<br/><br/>Also, I sincerely hope you got to use the phrase "Why are you arguing what's already been decided?" in your scene. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
