                    I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/07/01/crowdfunding-collection-78/" rel="nofollow"><b>Crowdfunding Collection no. 78, including every tabletop project started between 06.17 and 07.01.</b></a><br/><br/>Among the current projects for core books am most by <b>Fragged: Dieselpunk Mecha RPG</b>, mostly due to its setting. Though I do consider <b>Delve 2nd</b> and<b> Dungeon Degenerates</b> visually interesting as well and am somewhat curious about Delves d100 system. <b>SURVIVE THIS!!</b> and <b>Boast</b> aren’t bad, just in genres which currently just aren’t my cup of tea. They might still be worth a look if you like superheroes or pirates.<br/>I do like the design of the <b>Infinity D4</b> dice and they’ll likely fit well into a <b>Premium Dicebox</b>. This time around I did add a „Helpful card decks“ segment, which contains quite some cool decks to help GMs and players with improvisation. Next to that I think <b>HLG Con</b> might be worth checking out if you are looking for a convention with a distinct focus on Larp and quite some World of Darkness stuff. Oh, and there is the <b>Muertos Iluminados</b> playing card game, which I think looks really pretty.<br/>There are plenty more projects, just have a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>5 Role-Playing Games<br/>6 Supplements<br/>3 D&amp;D Supplements<br/>3 Adventures<br/>3 D&amp;D and PFRPG Adventures<br/>5 Dice Projects<br/>4 Dice Accessoires<br/>2 Map Projects<br/>2 Enamel Pins<br/>3 Helpful card decks<br/>6 Various RPG Projects<br/>1 Card game<br/>2 Other Games<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Adventure Path<br/>1 RPG Hybrid<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Supplement<br/>1 Map project<br/><br/><b>Swedish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Gamebook<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Supplement<br/><br/>Blog Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/07/01/crowdfunding-collection-78/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/07/01/crowdfunding-collection-78/</a> </div>

                            From the description its a basically a d100 dungeon crawler which took inspiration from the OSR. For more information, including where to find the the first edition, I would have to contact the team.                        </div>

                            I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/07/08/crowdfunding-collection-79/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 79, including every tabletop project started between 07.01 and 07.08.</a></b><br/><br/>After I took a break from backing projects, this collection sees my return.<br/>The project that brought me back was the second edition of <b>Geist: The Sin-Eaters</b>. I followed its development via the blog of Onyx Path Publishing and was intrigued by what I read. The setting sounds really cool, and I liked the VtR2 game I played. Thus, I have had to back it and it is one of the few OPP projects I do back because I believe in it. It has a delivery date of 2020, yet I think it’s worth the wait and recommend it. <b>John Silence</b> is a new project by Josh Jordan and offers a Urban Fantasy with two engaging premises. On the one hand the player characters aren’t white folks, on the other hand the conflict resolution isn’t that much focused on physically overpowering. Given the presentation, strong Kickstarter record, I couldn’t resist, invest in it and do recommend it. I am still hesitating to back <b>Tiny Supers</b>. Alan Bahrs newest entry to the TinyD6 system family. I enjoyed the previous projects a lot, yet „superhero“ isn’t that much my genre and I do still need to save up for GenCon.<br/>Similarly I am currently on the brink of backing <b>Behind the Masc Zine</b>, a magazine talking about games and a non-cis view on masculinity. Next to those I would recommend taking a look at <b>Killing Lee Garvin</b>, it’s not an RPG but a card game. Yet it looks fun, has a tabletop rpg theme and you’ll help the designer Lee Garvin with his medical expenses.<br/>Another game that ain’t a RPG is the <b>Edible Games Cookbook</b>. It isn’t a cookbook one can eat, but one to be used to literally cook-up games. I do really like the idea and recommend you’ll have a look.<br/>There are many more cool projects, like the <b>Mars Sourcebook</b> for Space 1889, just have a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Setting<br/>1 Supplements<br/>1 Adventure<br/>1 Dice Project<br/>4 Dice Accessoires<br/>1 RPG Magazin<br/>2 Map &amp; Terrain Projects<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/>2 Games with RPG-Connection<br/>1 Another cool Game Projects (Cookbook)<br/><br/><b>Portuguese Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Supplements<br/><br/>Blog article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/07/08/crowdfunding-collection-79/" rel="nofollow"><b>https://teylen.blog/2018/07/08/crowdfunding-collection-79/</b></a> </div>

                            I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/07/19/crowdfunding-collection-80/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 80, including every tabletop project started between 07.08 and 07.19.</a></b><br/><br/>The incoming GenCon has apparently motivated quite a lot of creatives and thus you’ll find no fewer than 13 projects for new rpgs alone. Well, and while I had the best intentions to safe up for the big event, I couldn’t resist a few gems.<br/>I got swept by <b>Demon City</b>, a new, modern horror game by Zak S. I backed his patreon before and thus had been already convinced by the astonishing artwork as well as by the rule system. You’ll find that it uses a tarot card deck, yet one might as well use regular d6. Next to that the stretch goals are quite cool as well.<br/>Of course I couldn’t resist the second edition of <b>Greg Stolze’s Reign</b>. The fantasy setting is nice and somewhat different, yet what sold me most is the one-roll engine/system. I am as intruiged by the ORE that it basically got this very blog started as I pondered if I could convert V:tM to it – I couldn’t or rather was to lazy to do it. The fact that Greg mentions that he might be working with „someone from White Wolf“ for a contemporary ORE setting was another cherry on a great cake. Go, check it, back it.<br/>The third game I backed is <b>Quickstarter: Harder They Fall</b> by James Illes. On the one hand, Legacy as a game and as a Kickstarter was an excellent experience. On the other hand, I do really like the idea as presented in the the description and am curious. If you are curious as well, hurry up, it only has a few days left.<br/>Next to those projects I am pondering to back the 2nd edition of <b>Over the Edge</b>. The setting is interesting, Urban Fantasy right up my ally and the system seems worth having a look, alas my resources are finite and thus am hestitating. Same goes for the <b>TERA DICE</b> dice set. It looks mighty cool and fancy… and everytime I ponder to maybe do drop the buck required.<br/>Yet, the other games are quite nice as well. <b>Esoterica</b> is a new urban fantasy game with some horror elements that does look interesting and utilizes the „proven“ d6 system. <b>Flotsam</b> is a gm-less games for those who actually liked the B5 episode „A view from the gallery“ and wished to play those folks. If you yearn for another PbtA game <b>Interstitial</b> got you covered with an interesting premise.<br/>Among the card-based systems <b>Zombie World</b> appears to be quite popular given the people I see who backed it and <b>Tales of Arcana</b> offers a nice card based character creation system. If you prefer d20 systems, check out <b>Proficiency</b> and <b>Frey</b>. I considered Proficiencey once and got Frey starred.<br/>If you like game books, <b>Samurai Slasher</b> looks cool, though it is already on the clock. The supplement <b>Animal Adventures</b> will supplement dogs to your game and if you play Delta Green you might like to have a look at <b>The Labyrinth</b>. I did like the cover of the D&amp;D supplement <b>Careless Adventurer’s Guide</b>. Well, and if you are a book-o-phile check out the lavishly designed, hand-crafted <b>Cthulhu based Spell Book</b>.<br/>You’ll find plenty more cool projects in the collection, see for yourself:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Urban Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>4 Story Game Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Card-based Role-Playing Games<br/>3 d20 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Gamebooks<br/>3 Supplements<br/>3 D&amp;D Supplements<br/>2 Settings<br/>3 Adventures<br/>4 Dice Projects<br/>4 Dice Accessoires<br/>1 Enamel Pin<br/>3 Map Projects<br/>5 Various RPG Projects<br/>3 RPG-related Games<br/>1 Larp/Theater Project<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Portuguese Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 RPG Community<br/><br/>Article: <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/07/19/crowdfunding-collection-80/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/07/19/crowdfunding-collection-80/</a></b> </div>
