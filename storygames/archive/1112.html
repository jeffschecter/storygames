<div class="Message">
                    Yesterday I met with a faculty member at a local University who is really interested in the pedagogy of gaming.  His proposal to a teaching and learning grant program piqued my interest because he used the term "roleplaying" and specifically mentioned Dungeons and Dragons, so I called him up and we met for a chat.  It turns out that he's a WoW player and his concept of roleplaying refers to MMORPG stuff.  He wants to explore constrained quest-type content with built-in status indications for his students.  Anyway, I showed him my Gen Con haul of indie games and explained what I do, and what's up with independent publishing and small games, and he was very excited to hear about RPGs with explicit end states, PRGs you can play in four hours, and RPGs that are not about slaying gnolls.<br/><br/>However!<br/><br/>He expressed his particular conundrum very well by describing an axis.  On one side is content.  His discipline is astronomy, so you've got a line from Star Wars (almost no useful content) to the movie Contact (A tiny bit) to Sagan's Cosmos (lots and lots).  Then you've got engagement, which runs from Fantasy Island (totally passive) to Jeopardy (you can sort of participate) to gaming (where you are pretty engaged).  Academics create stuff that is content-rich but engagement-poor, and most gaming experiences are the opposite.  <br/><br/>"I want a game like this," he said, holding up Nathan's Carry: A Game About War, "but about astronomy."  And not a sci-fi game where you interrupt the flow every so often to calculate the density of a neutron star, because that's not too engaging.  <br/><br/>So some questions.  First, what games, out of the box, can or could support rich academic content?  If you play PTA about botanists, can that lead to the productive and engaging transmission of botany content?<br/><br/>Second, what does an explicit, intentionally designed, engaging, content-rich RPG look like?                </div>

                            I just want to point you to the most recent Knutpunkt book, where there's an article about this - specifically, what sort of knowledge can be learned through engaging games, and what is better taught using other methods.

<p>This has me thinking of some of the more arcane shounen fight anime, such as <em>Hikaru no Go</em> (which explains Go strategy) or <em>Yakitate! Ja-pan</em> (which teaches us about bread). Those still carry a certain distinctive disruption of pace when they start being all academic, unfortunately, and I'm not sure it wouldn't hamper engagement.</p>
<p>Maybe a 1001 Nights approach would work? You accomplish things based on your knowledge of systems, or throw out questions that reveal aspects of them that you can later use.</p>

                            Anachronism hits all those notes, except it's a CCG, not an RPG.  So close, and yet so far.<br/><br/>I'll make a case that a lot of crunchy games are engaging and content rich for the kinds of logic that are handy for programming (Sequencing, dependancies, subsystems and so on) but thats an unintentional result of that being the thinking the designers are good at.<br/><br/>A lot of games, especially within the d20 context, have the capability of being able to support rich content regarding economics.  And the numbr of games that support pure math are beyond count.<br/><br/>The further you get from math-supported material, though....tougher.  I've got somethign in the pipe built with this sort of intent focused on a specific window of American History, and at Gencon I playtested in a game of Irish history that has a lot of the same priorities, but neither is more than larval yet.<br/><br/>But I dwell on this some, so let me raise a third question: Is it more effective for the game to transmit content, or would it be more effective if the game allowed _players_ to transmit content.  As an example, the default assumption about an astronomy game is that you'd want the person witht he most to teach in the GM seat, but GMing and Teaching can be hard to juggle - what if the GM is an enabler, and the knowledge is in a player's seat, to disseminiate sideways rather than down.<br/><br/>As an aside, this is also why I want more RPGs to look liek the Head First series of books.<br/><br/>Still thinking, but I need to hit the road.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            I don't think there are any explicit, intentionally designed, engaging, content-rich RPGs. Oh, I'm probably forgetting some particular example that's the exception. But, as you say, RPGs are designed to be engaging first. All of the "content" of RPGs is intended to be fantastical so that it's engaging, and so it's not academic in any way. <br/><br/>Actually, I think closest would be a game like Blue Planet, or, well, using GURPS Vehicles to design stuff. No surprise that Dr. Kromm (AKA Sean Punch), the long time line editor of GURPS, is a Phd in physics. On the other hand, as your friend mentions, this has all the engagement of calculating the density of neutron stars. That is, it's hardly any more engaging than doing homework. You have to love that sort of thing (I'm such a freak), to get into it. At which point a course is probably just as engaging. <br/><br/>Or nearly so. I know that lots of advanced astrophysics courses actually have projects to design actual spacecraft. Just the idea that it could be made is probably enough to be engaging on the "what if?" level. <br/><br/>Put another way, I think that the problem with something like an MMORPG is the gamism focus. The problem with something like Sorcerer as a tool is the focus on narrativism. I think that what we're looking at is a sim game here. If anything. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            I seem to recall someone (Greg Costikyan? Someone else?) writing not too long ago about different ways to do MMORPGs. Like, instead of players teaming up to whupass on some big bad monster, players team up as doctors to save a patient. Instead of Fighters, Clerics, Wizards, etc, you'd have General Surgeons, Heart Specialists, Anesthesiologists, etc.<br/><br/>What if you took that to other fields of study? Players team up to coordinate the launch of a probe, get it to land on Mars, get it to find collect different samples, get it back to Earth, and then analyze the samples?<br/><br/>Off the top of my head, it seems like a computer game would be better for this than a tabletop RPG. Like Mike was saying, an RPG rulebook for this kind of game would probably read like a textbook. But a computer RPG like this would be cool. But then, I like kids computer games like Oregon Trail.                        </div>

                            Like Carry but for astronomy...that is an awfully tall order.  Carry strikes me as right cool because it is aiming for an emotional, affective dimension of the war experience, which seems to me what rpg's are already about.  It just cranks the dials a good deal...here goes brainstorming, mostly towards your second question about what such games might look like.<br/>
<br/>
One, frontload the academic content.  Make the academic content part of 'world creation' (whatever that means in the context of the game) rather than something that happens in game.  Players get engaged because they know the information will color engaging play later.  My group is in the middle of a d20 Viking game--and I was really impressed at how invested everyone got in tracking down historical resources, doing linguistic research, studying mythology.  The old Traveller/Megatraveller stuff did some nifty stuff in terms of gesturing towards the 'hard' science.<br/>
<br/>
The science needs to be hardwired to the drama somehow, so that players *know* that the choices they make will be influenced by the science that gets frontloaded.  How that happens, well, I don't know--you definitely need to break the Star Trek model of science, where all problems get solved through the intervention of pseudo-science.  It seems that you will definitely want everyone at the table to have some serious equipment, esp. for quick calculations (ideally suited to a GM who gets to be the world, be the math, for the players who 'explore' it).<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so you need a scientific challenge but wired into a human conflict.  A far future where humans can move stars and planets around...a tight constellation of star/planets each with their own interested party (diplomacy!)...players as stellar movers who need to find a way to move planets in way pleasing to all participants?  (Need reason why moving could be bad for some groups, good for others...provide 'basic' movement in question, ideally in visual format, allowing players to tweak with orbits see results)...I don't know, I'm groping a little here.  Maybe backload some content, too, a debriefing of the science behind the solution or something.<br/>
<br/>
Which makes me think of how there is a real absence of strong sci-fi contenders in the MMORPG world.  There seem strong possibilities for wiring in content to a computer interface, where the math can be made very visual and visually appealing--orbits, gravitation, etc. all having some stunning graphical applications (I'm thinking of all the 'sexy' digital modeling that was done to show big ideas like black holes, too).                        </div>

<p>Oh how I disagree with that.  I think that <em>all</em> of the engaging games are engaging <em>because</em> they are covering content:  specifically they are helping us to engage with content that would be described as philosophy, psychology or ethics.  We are learning about and conveying the stuff <em>inside of us</em>.  There is an inherent emotional payoff to studying such material.</p>
<p>Now ... astronomy?  That's a harder topic to teach, not because it's hard to learn, but because it's hard to <em>want to learn</em>.  There is not much inherent emotional payoff (for most people) to understanding the rotating magnetic fields of a pulsar.  If you can discover or create that emotional payoff then you'll be closer to an engaging game.</p>

                            Weird that it's Biology and Astronomy faculty showing an interest in RPG theory.  We need more Media Studies faculty. ;D<br/>
<br/>
I'd start with audience -- who is the game for?  High-school students?  3rd year Astronomy students?  Star Trek fans?<br/>
Is the overall goal to <i>teach</i> astronomy?  And if it is, then knowledge / comprehension of course material should be worked into the game, so that actually knowing your stuff helps you play (and win) the game -- rather than just serving as colourful background material.                        </div>

                            My only addition here would be to suggest language/cultural content. I've been slowly (painfully slowly) been teaching myself Japanese. There are lots of bits of The Mountain Witch that I think would be that much cooler if players used honorifics and refered to things with proper Japanese (starting with the correct pronunciation of "ronin"). However, I think the missing element in this context is a reward mechanism. I could easily envision a game where the GM gave players XP/Fate Points/Drama Dice/small expendable resources whenever they (correctly) used the taught information. Cultural info is similar, but best for a historical game - I made a side comment at last night's TMW game about the differences between Western and Eastern bow technique, but only as color. Basically, anything that better immerses the players in the game experience *and* enhances their knowledge of something should be fair game.                        </div>

                            Tony, I don't disagree, really. I was talking to Shreyas, Jonathan, and Thomas at GenCon about how I feel that RPGs are a modern form of something like shamanism, and how that it's about informing each other of our values. <br><br>But that's about expressing, as you point out, internal things to the person telling the story. What I'm saying no RPG has been set up to do is to teach something external and concretely rational like Astronomy. Even historical RPGs have always had to allow for variation from history (and are very rarely played - when's the last time you heard of anyone playing Privateers and Gentlemen). <br><br/>This all said, a post above makes me recall this game: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/mithrapolis/mars.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/mithrapolis/mars.html</a><br/><br/>Paul Elliot's MARS is fascinating precisely because it explores the potential logistics and issues of a Mars colony. That said, I still don't think that the system does anything to help with this. But at least it seems to be the intent of the game. <br/><br/>To actually reinforce pedagogy, there would have to be rules like bonuses to resolution for remembering actual facts, or rewards for doing "reports" as content additions to the game. Like player A gets some Metapoints for having his character introduce some esoteric subject in-character using real-world research. <br/><br/>That's what I don't think has been done. <br/><br/>Mike                        </br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joshua neff</cite>I seem to recall someone (Greg Costikyan? Someone else?) writing not too long ago about different ways to do MMORPGs. Like, instead of players teaming up to whupass on some big bad monster, players team up as doctors to save a patient. Instead of Fighters, Clerics, Wizards, etc, you'd have General Surgeons, Heart Specialists, Anesthesiologists, etc.</blockquote>
That was Raph Koster in his blog post, <a href="http://www.raphkoster.com/2006/03/02/the-healing-game/" rel="nofollow">The Healing Game</a>.<br/><br/>The trick to making an RPG that teaches astronomy is to make the astronomical knowledge vital to player success. Make a game about starbuilding or star mining. Give players choices to make based on the composition of the system or the star's position on an H-R diagram. Work in some actual pictures of star fields and make the players identify the moving blip that indicates a planetary body. Basically, the professor writes down the list of development goals for his curriculum and the game designer uses that as a checklist of things to get into the game somehow.                        </div>

                            As an aside, I note that some of this hinges on the fact that awesome is not the sole domain of gaming.<br/><br/>I could do this with a historical or poltical game, and someday will, because those are the things I know and am passionate about.  I know where the awesome is.<br/><br/>I could probably come up with something that technically teaches astronomy, like any game using a starmap, but frankly, it'd suck.  I have no love.  I don't know where the awesome is.<br/><br/>Of course, the corrolary of this is that you need to be passionate about the topic, but willing to draw the line.  If you know any topic well, go grab an introductory textbook about it sometime - it'll probably be pure crap, so much so that it will frustrate you to no end.  Sometimes this will be because textbooks suck, but more often it will be because introductory texts _have_ to be wrong, because to be right would require a deeper understanding on the reader's part, creating a catch-22.  Game design has a tendency towards the obsessive and the completist, and the political game that reflects all of my accumulated understanding is going to be such a bloated, specialized monstrosity as to be useless, but a game based purely on the precepts of, say, <i>The Prince</i> or <i>Hardball</i> would be both functional and probably quite powerful.<br/><br/>So, bottom line, it's a very narrow margin of functionality, but a powerful one.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

Let me underline this and put it in bold.  Koster's premise is that learning _is_ fun - it's the expression of our joy of extracting patterns from noise, and games that reward that tend to be satisfying.  Now, note that it is _a_ theory of fun, not _the_ theory of fun, and Koster goes to lengths to make it clear that this is not the only way to make something fun, but it's a powerful idea all the same.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Okay, here's me jumping up and down and cursing, having lost a big chunky comment. =P<br/><br/>Jason, I think it's important to distinguish between teaching academic <em>knowledge</em> and teaching academic <em>practice</em>.<br/><br/>Knowledge -- identifying stars, calculating neutron star density, reciting the main sequence of stars -- is hard data and information.  It's the base of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives" rel="nofollow">Bloom's Taxonomy</a> (Know, Comprehend, shading into Apply), and it's important stuff.  However, it's also kind of boring; this is the stuff that gives school a bad name, because at root it's pretty much memorization.  This is what you'd get if you create a game set in a content-appropriate setting and give players bonuses for recalling and applying bits of information.  This would, I suspect, always be transparently a classroom activity dressed up like a fun game.  The other important thing to remember is that content only gets into a game one way -- through the players, and so no matter what you put into the book, you'd need to piggyback into the game via a player.  At this point, the <em>game</em> isn't teaching the players anything, it's the <em>prep</em> for the game that's doing all the teaching.  (See GURPS sourcebooks for a prime example.)  At best, you could get some small-group learning involved, with each individual bringing different expert knowledge to the group and sharing it around.<br/><br/>Practice -- the things that actual professionals do in their field -- is all about process and procedure.  It's the upper portions of the Taxonomy (Apply, Analyze, Synthesize, Evaluate), and this is jump up and down fun.  It requires some grounding in the hard-data Knowledge to base your conclusions off of, but less than you might think.  What's important is that you take some information and you <em>play with it</em>, rather than simply recall and recite it.  Process is actually easier to embed into a game than knowledge; you just put it into the rules (I think somebody suggested doing resolution by picking out the moving point of light between two star fields, for instance).  This is also -- to be a little arrogant for a moment -- the territory of indie games.  Games like <em>carry</em>, <em>Dogs</em>, and <em>Primetime Adventures</em> are all about exploring and experiencing process.  It's not what you play about, it's <em>how</em> you play it.<br/><br/>So I know next to nothing about what real astronomers actually do, so I'll use history as an example.  To approach things from the Knowledge angle, you could set up a game in a historical setting and give players die bonuses for correctly recalling pertinent historical details.  To me, this screams "After School Special" or "Marginally Entertaining Cartoon Designed to Teach Kids About Egypt."  However, if you approach things from the Practice angle, you could make the game about time travellers (because all historians are time travellers) who astrally project themselves into the past to follow clues and collect evidence to support or disprove a given thesis (like "Abraham Lincoln intended to abolish slavery").  Note that you could pretty easily embed the die-bonus for historical recall into the second design, as well.  But the time-traveller game, where players are actually able to take the raw historical data (even if some of it is fictional -- important point) and play with it, to "be historians" for a little while, that's going to be far more engaging for the players and let them actually <em>do history</em> rather than <em>study history</em>.                        </div>

                            It might be worth mentioning that Media Relations training is, basically, Role-Playing.  (Mock interviews etc)  Crisis Management training is also Role-Playing, where the group is presented with a crisis situation (by the instructor/GM) and they have to act out how they respond to it.  In a way, it's a bit LARPish -- but without the costumes.  Police, the Army, and Hospitals also do a lot of Role-Playing around responding to disasters, complete with people playing "NPCs" in the role of casualties.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen political science / history classes use the game Diplomacy (which has no dice or GM) in a classroom setting to very good effect.  That can have an RP element depending on how the group approaches it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure the Sciences (Astronomy, Biology, etc) lend themselves to Role-Playing as much as the dramatic arts, media studies, social studies, medical studies, judicial studies, hospitality studies... etc                        </div>

                            Jason, hook me up with this guy. Maybe I'll be able to finish <i>Fingers on the Firmament</i> after all.<br/><br/>The basic description: <i>It's about people reaching up into the night sky and yanking on stars, propelling themselves out into that big, empty void. And it's about the type of community (yes, community) that forms when you're all alone amid the blackness and so is everyone you meet (or, more likely, don't meet).</i><br/><br/>Part of the game was definitely supposed to involve teaching certain cosmological principles, the various types of stars and galaxies, and the local geography of our end of the Milky Way. In fact, I took Astro 101 in college specifically so I could write this game. But it never quite came together.                        </div>

                            So, I've got a page of links on educational uses of RPGs,<br/><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/whatis/education.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Educational Uses of RPGs</b></a><br/><br/>One of which is my own essay, <br/><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/theory/realism.html" rel="nofollow"><b>RPG Realism &amp; Education</b></a><br/><br/>So, as far as astronomy, I got a fair amount out of original Traveller.  Someone mentioned a game which handled exploring new star systems -- and that's exactly what it had (specifically thinking of Book 6: Scouts here).  It explains the star sequence OBAFGKM, calculating the habitable zone, as well as bringing up some important points like the effect of albedo on a planet's effect.  (Though nothing about greenhouse effects, if I recall.)  It also had a good handling of simple orbital mechanics.  Nothing revolutionary, but a lot that I never learned otherwise as an early teenager.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, this sort of thing has mostly fallen by the wayside in more recent games.  Blue Planet put some thought into it's scientific backstory, but there is hardly any explanation of the science within the game.                        </div>

                            An interesting possible use for more story-oriented game would be in teaching concepts in literary criticism.  So, one might have a game based in literature of a specific period or literary theory.  I'm not sure if I can think of any particular examples, though.                        </div>

                            High Concept: Aria + 'The Verse' from Serenity<br/><br/>Posit that The Verse was, in fact, created by a race with advanced terraforming/gravity technologies, and made a solar system with 'dozens of planets' and 'hundreds of moons' that were either habitable or nearly so.  <br/><br/>In the game, the players are the movers and shakers of this alien (or very-future-human) society - on the scale of The Culture.  The creation of planets and moons requires understanding, well, planetology.  How planets are put together, how to set up an orbit, the characteristics of the star, etc.<br/><br/>Make it a Type III civilization (The Culture is a late Type-II), and you're crafting stars and other exotics.<br/><br/>That's a shell for an idea - I'll be back with more.<br/><br/>(And Aria - or a much better version of it - would be an amazing pedagogical tool for history or social sciences.)                        </div>

I'd say I learned primarily by reading the books first -- but the active component of play was a strong influence, because in play we would have to go over what all the system variables meant.  i.e. I might roll up a star system beforehand, but afterwards I needed to explain what an E9 star with a planet in orbit 4 meant.  <br/><br/>There was definitely more of an active learning role than in Anachronism (the History Channel card game where different historical soldiers fight).  The stats and what they meant weren't just flavor text -- they were an active part of what we learned about the system.  And the orbital mechanics rules were actively used during play.  <br/><br/>Obviously, if I was deliberately designing a system for teaching astronomy, there's a lot that I'd do differently -- but I'd still look carefully at Traveller and what it did well.  Probably much would be the same: I'd have adventures scattered among different star systems, with hops in between them and a random generation.  I'd probably have more powerful FTL drives so as to feature galactic scale and occaisional rare phenomena like nebula or black holes and such.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>Sometimes this will be because textbooks suck, but more often it will be because introductory texts _have_ to be wrong, because to be right would require a deeper understanding on the reader's part, creating a catch-22.  Game design has a tendency towards the obsessive and the completist, and the political game that reflects all of my accumulated understanding is going to be such a bloated, specialized monstrosity as to be useless, but a game based purely on the precepts of, say,<i>The Prince</i>or<i>Hardball</i>would be both functional and probably quite powerful.<br/><br/>So, bottom line, it's a very narrow margin of functionality, but a powerful one.</blockquote>
As I understand it, the ideal learning situation is one in which the learner is required to know slightly more than they currently do, and are aided by an expert who has the requisite knowledge.  So you'd really want a game that starts out very basic, then builds in complexities as the game goes on: once the players have the basics down, you throw some quirks at them, or flesh out ideas you glossed over before.<br/><br/>Which is a perfect description of how D&amp;D's level system works, really.  The new player with a first level character only needs to know a small fraction of the rules (insert snide comment about the large number of D&amp;D rules here), and learns more each time they level or face an unusual encounter: you can't hit this thing with your sword, so you need to learnt the grappling rules, or whatever.  Also, the traditional model of corebook plus supplements follows a similar learning pattern: start relatively simple, then add in more complex subsystems as you go.                        </div>
