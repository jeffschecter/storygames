So the three of us remaining decided to get together for a one-shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe AP of our regular campaign of Apocalypse World is <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?594659-Apocalypse-World-Bloody-deaths-and-happy-endings" rel="nofollow">Bloody Deaths and Happy Endings</a>. Please take the time to check it out, I'm told it's an entertaining read and it's more indicitative of our sessions than what follows!<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we'd assembled at our hosts' flat, we discussed which game to play:<br/>\n- Guys, I'd love to GM Barbarians of Lemuria, but I've had a lot of late nights because of Christmas parties and I don't think I have the energy. How about something GM-less? I also brought Remember Tomorrow.<br/>\n- OK, Gm-less sounds alright. I also have a copy of Capes that my cousin the GM gave me, I've partially read it.<br/>\n- So we have a choice of Remember Tomorrow and Capes. Capes?<br/>\n- Sure, let's try Capes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe three of us opened the Capes rulebook and made some characters. Our three heroes were:<br/>\n<br/>\nMr Niceguy (aka Luke Cajun) - a Magneto clone<br/>\n<br/>\nPOWERS: Magnetic Blast 3, Move Metal 4, Become Magnetism 1, Force Field 2<br/>\nSTYLES: Trap Opponent 1, Reminders of the Past 2, Control Everything 5, Snap Without Warning 3, Indirect Action 4<br/>\nATTITUDES: Grim 3, Quiet 2, Untrusting 1<br/>\nDRIVES: Truth 2, Love 1, Hope 1, Pride 3, Power 2<br/>\nEXEMPLAR: Sally (daughter, teen) - <i>Only thing keeping his LOVE alive, Luke feels he should protect her</i><br/>\n<br/>\nMyster-E (aka Mark Rogers) - a shapeshifter<br/>\n<br/>\nPOWERS: Change Physical state 1, Resilient Body 2, Change Shape 3, Strengths of Current Form 4<br/>\nSTYLES: Surround an Area 1, See the Big Picture 2, Reach Inaccessible Places 3, Misunderstand Humanity 4, Shift Out Of Danger 5<br/>\nATTITUDES: Curious 1, Cold 2, Logical 3<br/>\nDRIVES: Truth 3, Fear 2, Hope 1, Justice 1, Power 2<br/>\nEXEMPLAR: Tony Parlour (runs sideshow) - Knows the TRUTH<br/>\n<br/>\nGlitter! - a Dazzler clone<br/>\n<br/>\nPOWERS: Project Sensations 4, Pyrotechnics 3, Transform Into Light 1, Voice Fills an Arena 2<br/>\nSTYLES: Smile Lights Up The Room 2, Mass Crowd Influence 5, Thrillseeker 1, Glamour 3, Paragon of Virtue 4<br/>\nATTITUDES: Trusting 3, Down-to-Earth 2, Shy 1<br/>\nDRIVES: Pride 1, Love 2, Hope 4, Fear 1, Truth 1<br/>\nEXEMPLAR: Mike (her manager) - FEAR; "believes in me but I don't believe in myself"<br/>\n<br/>\nMr Niceguy and Myster-E were created using the Click-and-Lock system; Glitter was begun that way but converted to Freeform so she could fit the Dazzler mould.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHe player who created Mr Niceguy also, very sensibly, created a villain:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Visitor - evil Superman<br/>\n<br/>\nPOWERS: Super Strength 2, Invulnerability 3, Flight 1<br/>\nSTYLES: Casually Overpower Mortals 2, Face Down Hypocrites 4, Inspire Awe 5, Infectious Energy 1, Divert Large Objects 3<br/>\nATTITUDES: Inspired 1, Determined 3, Judgmental 2, Reckless 4<br/>\nDRIVES: Justice 2, Hope 3, Pride 4, Power 1, Fear 5<br/>\nEXEMPLAR: Mish (AI drone advisor) - wants The Visitor to dispense his JUSTICE<br/>\n<br/>\nCreating characters took at least an hour, making it almost two hours by the time we started playing the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe then started our first SCENE. We chose characters: the three heroes, Mr Nicguy, Myster-E and Glitter! The scene starts in New York, with Mr Niceguy battling the JIVE MONSTER that has attacked from the sewer.<br/>\n<br/>\nScene One, Page One - Conflicts<br/>\nGOAL: Mr Niceguy wants to go home<br/>\nGOAL: Glitter! needs to get to her concert<br/>\nGOAL: Scare off Jive Monster<br/>\n<br/>\nGlitter!, on her way to her big pop concert, passes by an alley where she spots Mr Niceguy battling the Jive Monster. Cursing, she ZIPS IN AS LIGHT to help out.<br/>\nMyster-E has also arrived on the scene. He transforms his body and SURROUNDS AN AREA around the Jive Monster.<br/>\nMr Niceguy BECOMES MAGNETISM to disrupt the Jive Monster's sense of balance. Like a bird, the monster is guided by magnetic fields and is confused.<br/>\n<br/>\nNear the end of Page One, we have a discussion.<br/>\n- This conflict is dull. Can we introduce more characters?<br/>\n- No, we can only claim characters at the beginning of Scenes.<br/>\n- But that sucks. We are playing three heroes and not the villain. Where's the conflict?<br/>\n- The Jive Monster is there, he's part of the scene. We're just not playing it directly.<br/>\n- The conflict is, do we capture the Jive Monster or drive it away? And can Glitter! get to her concert?<br/>\n- Are we really stuck with this set-up for the rest of the scene? The book should have told us not to play all heroes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMyster-E ends Page One by capturing the Jive Monster WITHIN HIMSELF and dragging it down the sewer. His associate, Tony Parlour, has a lab where they can hold it and study it.<br/>\n<br/>\nScene One, Page Two<br/>\nWe still have two of the three conflicts outstanding, DRIVE OFF JIVE MONSTER having been resolved. We add a new conflict:<br/>\nEVENT: sewer caves in<br/>\nGOAL: Myster-E is trying to take the Jive Monster to Tony Parlour<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have more conversation about the rules:<br/>\n- Hmmm, so we can stake DEBT on conflicts, depending on DRIVES, and by winning them we get STORY TOKENS and we can SPLIT DICE - and then there's INSPIRATION and...<br/>\n- My head hurts.<br/>\n- The rules are really confusingly written. Didn't you say you'd read them?<br/>\n- I tried reading them a number of times, and gave up. I was hoping they'd get clearer in play.<br/>\n- Oh.<br/>\n<br/>\nPage Two continues the scene with Myster-E dragging the Jive Monster further down by TRAPPING HIS OPPONENT.<br/>\nThere is a cave-in. The sewer comes down around them; they can't see Glitter!<br/>\nMr Niceguy makes a FORCE FIELD to keep the tunnel up around them. It doesn't hold, so he uses a MAGNETIC BLAST to drag out steel girders from the walls to hold up the debris.<br/>\nMyster-E lacks confidence in the stability of the reinforcements so he SEES THE BIG PICTURE and tests the girders. They hold.<br/>\nThe sewer safe, Myster-E drags the Jive Monster down to Tony Parlour's lab.<br/>\nGlitter finds a side path to the surface, and TURNS TO LIGHT so she can zap off to her concert. End of scene.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Thank God that scene's over.<br/>\n- It's after 10:30, we've spent almost an entire evening on one scene. Are we going to continue?<br/>\n- Yeah, let's try for a new scene, I don't want this whole session to have been a waste.<br/>\n<br/>\nScene Two, Page One<br/>\n<br/>\nWith little time left, we wanted to set this scene up properly.<br/>\n- This time one of us is playing a goddamn villain. Do you mind if I throw out Glitter! and play The Visitor?<br/>\n- Be my guest. I'll take Mr Niceguy again.<br/>\n- And I'll stick with Myster-E.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this scene, The Visitor has attacked the city, to force it to adopt his peculiar idea of JUSTICE. He has captured Town Hall, sealing government officials and civilians inside. He's demanding the city reinstates the death penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\nConflict<br/>\nGOAL: The Visitor won't release Town Hall until the city give in to his demands<br/>\n<br/>\nMyster-E and Mr Niceguy head down to Town Hall as fast as they can to resolve the situation. They find the city in chaos, with police barely keeping a perimeter around the outside of Town Hall.<br/>\nMyster-E, quickly assessing the situation, REACHES INACCESSIBLE PLACES by squeezing his body in through one of the Town Hall windows. He proceeds to locate the hostages inside.<br/>\nThe Visitor, noticing the heroes arrive, INSPIRES AWE keeping the police away from the building and slowing the heroes down.<br/>\nMr Niceguy isn't intimidated by the Visitor's display and MOVES METAL to trap the Visitor in steel cables.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Okay, this scene's going much better. We have a better character set-up and a more tangible conflict.<br/>\n- Seems like the book should offer some hints about that, so players don't waste almost their entire session waffling about in a sewer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr Niceguy now stakes debt from his drive POWER to split the dice. He tells the Visitor "this is MY city, you're not taking control!" He BECOMES MAGNETISM and tightens the cables.<br/>\nInside the Town Hall, Myster-E CHANGES SHAPE into a wrecking ball so he can bash his way through the walls.<br/>\nThe Visitor, seeing this, flies RECKLESSLY toward Myster-E to stop the damage, but<br/>\nMr Niceguy uses his MAGNETIC BLAST to knock him out of the sky. End of Page One.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Wow, you two kicked my arse in that page.<br/>\n- Yeah, splitting the dice helped a lot. We're starting to get a grip on the mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nScene Two, Page Two<br/>\nNew conflicts<br/>\nGOAL: get civilians to safety<br/>\nGOAL: Mr Niceguy must save his EXEMPLAR Sally who is trapped in the Town Hall<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a big hole now bashed in the wall, the civilians are no longer trapped inside but the heroes must still get them away from the Visitor and to safety. Unfortunately, Mr Niceguy has just remembered - his daughter Sally was on a field trip with her class, and she's trapped in the upper floor of the Town Hall!<br/>\n<br/>\n- So I'm adding a new goal to mess with you guys. Um, something like, "The visitor has trapped Sally in the building and wants Mister Niceguy to... hmmm."<br/>\n- That's too wordy, rephrase it as a goal.<br/>\n- OK, how about "Mr Niceguy must save Sally from..." but hold on, if I do it like that, you can veto it, right?<br/>\n- Ah, I won't veto it. We're almost out of time anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMyster-E uses the STRENGTH OF HIS CURRENT FORM (the wrecking ball) to get the civilians out of the building.<br/>\nMr Nice guy tries to TRAP HIS OPPONENT.<br/>\nMyster-E SURROUNDS AN AREA to keep the civilians safe. He stretches his body around them.<br/>\nThe Visitor INSPIRES AWE once again to keep the civilians trapped and afraid. However, he fails and the heroes get the people to safety.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd of Page One<br/>\n<br/>\n- It's well over time, we should end it here.<br/>\n- Okay. That could have gone better, if we had a few more days to decipher the rules. Thanks for hosting!<br/>\n- No problem. See you guys next year!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two visiting players depart the flat and begin the long journey home. On the way, one of us has another look at the rulebook.<br/>\n<br/>\n- You know, now we've attempted a session, I feel I understand this a bit better. It seems like a good game, and the second scene was working better.<br/>\n- I found it pretty frustrating, the rules were almost impenetrable.<br/>\n- I'd want to read the book about five times before trying it again. It's not overly complex but there are so many interlocking parts, and if you get stuck on just one part the whole system locks up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that was our session. We took five hours and got through a scene and a half. I hope this doesn't come off too harsh; we did attempt to play the game with the rules only half-read by one player. Next time we will start with a more sensible conflict and characters that can work more as adversaries. I do think there's a good game in there somewhere.

I love the detail. You are right about this game being complicated. Seth Magdich runs an excellent, stripped down demo if you ever catch him at a con. Also, this flash version of an example of play is the coolest:<br><br><a href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/Downloads/Capes%20Example1.swf" rel="nofollow">Muse of Fire - Flash Thingy</a> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
