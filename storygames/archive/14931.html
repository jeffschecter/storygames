I think I'd start the game with some flashbacks, or other events happening before the war, to show the characters as humans, not only faceless baby killers.<br/><br/>There's this old movie with Rutger Hauer called <b>Soldier of Orange</b> (<i>minor spoilers for that movie follows</i>), that shows what the war did to a group of friends.  Most of them were "good guys" who fought in the resistance in various ways, but one of the characters joins the other side, and his destiny is just as moving as that of the others. Probably because we get to see him as he was before the war.<br/><br/>I'd stay clear of the Holocaust, unless the game was written to make a specific point somehow. No matter which point of view was taken. Not to say there aren't interesting stories to be found there, I have seen many movies with that back drop, but it would make me feel somewhat uncomfortable I think.

And it is definitely a game that can offend people, or worse IMO touch upon traumas from the past since it contains strong themes including sexual abuse and cause genuine and highly undesired discomfort or anxiety.  Yet, I don't think that we should shy away from such games but instead be very clear about what the games are about, so that everyone can make a choice of whether to participate or not.<br/><br/>Every game of Montsegur I run is preceded by an "antipitch", where I explain that the game contains mature themes, I give some examples, and suggest that we play another game instead if anyone even hesitates a little. This weeds out the players that would not enjoy the game, and it also makes a clear statement of what is expected of the players that play the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_339914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339914/#Comment_339914" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T00:03:44+00:00" title="August 22, 2011 12:03AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It could be that removing the game from "nazi" and into the general realm of "totalitarism" would open up the field.

The great thing about it was that none of the players/characters could flee from the responsibility of their own choices. They had seen the consequences of total war, and had held the swords themselves.

First read through on the thread I was already imagining the word Nazi as a stand in for any despicable human behavior.<br><br>Two things I would suggest to help maintain respect, first is to never let the characters off the hook.  This doesn't mean they need to be punished in the story, but rather we must be reminded what it is they've done that makes us look down on them.  Their acts of evil should be in full view and directly associated with them.<br/><br/>Second, I would consider blocking out time to discuss the events of a session after it is over.  Time to discuss the themes and events, how they relate to the same or similar events in real life.  The impact they had on the victims and the importance of all this to the participants in the game.<br/><br/>There is a documentary series I would recommend, Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State, both for some direct relevance to a Nazi game and also for a potential format of after game discussions.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339922/#Comment_339922" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T00:42:00+00:00" title="August 22, 2011 12:42AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wilhelm,<br/><br/>I think I love Montsegur so much because it takes me out of my comfort zone.

But I will only inflict that experience on someone who asks for it (not saying that you would, just that I am very careful when I set up games).<br/><br/>A very interesting feeling came to me when I played Montsegur and got the Inquisitor story card, and got to play the "Nazis" of the the game for a while.  A dude who acted in good faith and with good intentions, yet from the view point of the other characters was a horrible person. The change of perspective, suddenly threw my compass of Good/Bad out of alignment. And the situation wasn't black and white any longer. That was very cool, and is very much a part of why I like Montsegur so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
