                    I'm revising <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/files/City%20of%20Masks%20Storygame.pdf" rel="nofollow">City of Masks</a> following Mendel's playtest, and one of his comments was that he "wanted a reason not to just try to win". In other words, this is kind of a gamey-game rather than a storygame, despite the fact that it incorporates narration.<br/><br/>That's a fair criticism. I think the answer I'm going for is to redefine "win". His group chose the first of several victory conditions that I proposed as suggestions - play to a set number of points. I now think it would probably be better if you had Risk-style "objectives" to play towards, secret from the other players, so that the theme of being manipulating, backstabbing, scheming bastards was reinforced. (I have no idea why I've written that kind of game. I'm a very gentle and straightforward person. Perhaps <i>that's</i> why.)<br/><br/>Originally I had this as another victory-condition option, done by people making up the objectives themselves, writing them on cards, then randomizing the cards so that you probably wouldn't get the one you'd written down. Now I'm thinking, let's do it by playing-card draw, since I've already got playing-card drawing going on for a couple of other things, and it seems to work quite well by the playtest report. My thinking is this:<br/><br/>You draw from the non-court cards, after you've set up your relationships (so you can't optimize your relationships to serve your objective, and it's therefore more likely that you'll be doing something difficult). A-10 determine who your objective relates to, and suit determines what the objective is. Thus:<br/><br/>A	Your character<br/>2	The player to your leftâ€™s character<br/>3	The player to your rightâ€™s character<br/>4	The player oppositeâ€™s character<br/>5	Your closest friend<br/>6	Your worst enemy<br/>7	The Sun Temple<br/>8	The Moon Temple<br/>9	The Commissioners of Masks<br/>10	The Personalist Underground<br/><br/>("Closest friend" and "worst enemy" have a mechanical definition.)<br/><br/>So far, for the actions, I have Betray, Seduce and Humiliate. Betray means build up the relationship to a high positive level, then do something that brings significant loss. Seduce means improve the relationship to a set degree. Humiliate means cause someone to fail when it's important.<br/><br/>I need a fourth thing that young nobles in a courtly-intrigue kind of setting do, that can be mechanically expressed in terms of affecting standing.<br/><br/>Oh, and I need either alternatives that I can apply to "your character" (since nobody is going to betray, seduce or deliberately humiliate themselves - not in this game), or else a tenth target for betrayal, seduction, humiliation and whatever the fourth thing is.                </div>

                            Hi Mike,<br/>
<br/>
How about a positive action? Is that outside the theme of your game? The first thing I thought was how do they have a closest friend if everything they do is somewhat negative.                        </div>

                            Ah, I like Clyde's suggestion.  The inclusion of one "positive" agenda with the three "negative" agendas means that there will always be uncertainty on whether someone is helping you out for his own benefit or out of his own good will.                        </div>

                            Yes, that's pretty much the conclusion I came to as well. The fourth term is "glorify" (or some synonym).<br><br>So you have a positive and a negative strongest relationship, and you can do positive or negative things. This works out as:<br/><br/>                     +         -<br/>+  (friend)  Glorify   Betray<br/><br/>-  (enemy) Seduce  Humiliate<br/><br/>And as you observe, JBR, this increases the paranoia because you can't tell whether someone is helping you in order to glorify you, seduce you or betray you.<br/><br/>I think I may simplify it down to having one interpersonal goal (relating to either the closest friend or the worst enemy) and one factional goal.                        </br></br></div>

<p>Mike, Cold City uses a similar thing, with Political and Personal Agendas.</p>
<p>This seems like good fun. I still see playing for the win and don't see any problem with that.</p>
