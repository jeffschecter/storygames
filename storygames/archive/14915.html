The players were writers and editors of the comic, as well as the characters in the story.<br/><br/>The grid of powers was innovative too. You had some 8 or 10 power groups to choose from (Chemical, Electrical, Power, etc.) and you would cross-reference those to create vague power descriptions (Chemical + Ballistic meant doing Lethal Chemical damage at Range). Depending on the campaign, you would select 2, 3, or 4 groups as your starting power level and experience points would increase your power in a given area. Granted the game was long before "framing scenes" but the innovative initiative system was designed for conflict resolution, even though that wasn't a term yet.<br/><br/>Crimson Cutlass remains the only pirate game worth playing (that's right, I worked on 7th Sea and I'm still saying that). It came in three books, one of which was for resolving story threads and forks. It used a tarot deck for success, which was keyed against player aspects like "swimming" or "captaining." It drew heavily from the Tales of the Arabian Nights board game or vice versa. And because of the book design, you could play without a GM (not that the designers considered this) or rotated the GM around the table so players could take turns steering the adventure (just like Inspectres).<br/><br/>Barony had a brilliant Magic System where there were five laws to magic and casting a spell meant violating 1 to 5 of those laws, which determined the difficulty in casting the spell. Sadly, on a 2d8 system, the range just wasn't there and the game needed a slightly better chart. We had a game once where someone actually had the sun come down and touch the villain, burning him to a crisp. Of course, everyone on earth died too. But if you like that kind of freedom in your magic systems, have at it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339108/#Comment_339108" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T19:03:54+00:00" title="August 16, 2011  7:03PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2011 3:29AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In nostalgia threads like this I always, always pull out Bunnies and Burrows, which I adore and which was ground-breaking in a zillion different ways. <br/><br/>It's <b>1976</b>, and we've got:<br/><br/>Animal protagonists like it is no big thing<br/>Detailed martial arts rules<br/>Detailed rules for the sense of smell, reproduction, etc. (extreme procedural genre emulation)<br/>Leveling of individual attributes, which in play comes perilously close to Keys<br/>Attribute-based classes with built in, elegant niche protection<br/>Games within games - play rabbits playing games (It just occurred to me how weird and awesome this is)<br/><br/>So much more, a totally crazy game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339112/#Comment_339112" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T19:14:04+00:00" title="August 16, 2011  7:14PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>Years ago, here in LA there was a game company called Better Games.

Though, not sure if this was actually the case or not, but there's a <i>business reason</i> why you don't give explicit instructions: giving people detailed instructions on how to play with your toy limits your audience to those who want to play with it in that way. But as Hanlon's Razor states, never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity - it's equally or perhaps even more likely that they simply carried on the tradition of poor editing and blind reliance on oral traditions which they grew up with.<br/><br/>In retrospect though, good for them - people took V:tM and made it their own. I was steeped in the Swedish tradition of BRP / CoC, and played disadvantages, RP rewards, conflicting nature/demeanor pairs, inter-party conflicts, and self-directed status play to the hilt. But as soon as I acquired Internet access, I found all these North American websites with house rules for playing Black Hand Sabbat agents on dangerous missions, including single use "Discipline Tomes", XP awards for killing people, and other very odd D&amp;Desque artifacts which made absolutely no sense to me. But clearly, people were having fun with the game in their own ways, which couldn't have hurt WW's bottom line one bit.<br/><br/>Compare this with the more procedural and clear way of teaching mechanics of play and play processes of many modern designs, and one thing that pops to mind (for me, at least) is that a certain kind of ubiquitous gamer will dig their heels in and say "that's not how I like to play, so screw it". These guys have a comfort level with a particular mode of game and are unwilling to learn not only a new set of core rules, but a totally new (or worse, a similar but with several very important key differences) set of techniques to generate play properly - instead, they want to take everything they've learned in every game in their gaming history and willy-nilly apply it to all their games because "that's what works in their group". White Wolf would've alienated this crowd by telling them how to play - instead, they authored a pretty game with a ton of vampire micro-fiction, tables upon tables of abilities and powers, and Rule Zero, which obviously goes over better with the masses.<br/><br/>Edit: To tie this post in with the topic, I'd hazard to say that Vampire was a cutting-edge game mostly because it figured out how to capitalize on a trend, whereas most games prior to that was deeply entrenched in its own self-described genre. From a marketing perspective, this served to bring more people into the hobby rather than just poaching players from other, similar games. I wouldn't say it was "before its time" though, because it was clearly a very timely release.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339150/#Comment_339150" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T23:23:34+00:00" title="August 16, 2011 11:23PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tork</cite><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>Years ago, here in LA there was a game company called Better Games.

My friends and I did experiment with ignoring the mechanics and using informal Drama resolution to settle conflict in-game (i.e. "just talking it all out"), so we didn't invoke the Rule; we basically lived it. We had first RPed with Everway, king of 90's Drama-rez play, and I was in love. <br/><br/>The sequence was basically Everyway - D&amp;D2 - Vampire. D&amp;D was wayyyy too structured and table-heavy for my/our tastes, so when we got around to Vampire, we loved the setting and mood and rich detail (including that awesome list of true and false vampire myths! so cool.) but weren't interested in gun tables, soak values, etc. <br/>I actually once ran a brief session of Vampire while swimming in a river with my players.

I was tired reading the thread and missed JD saying the point was done,<br/><br/>Anyway, I can t be sure now but I had been playing various RPGs for over ten years by then, so it's absolutely possible that it made a difference. It was obviously trying to do something different, but having prior experience meant I knew what it was trying to be different to. The problem with the shotguns and sewers game I played in was that it was D&amp;D with fangs. It was obvious though that Vamp wasn't supposed to be that. Knowing though what it wasn't supposed to be must have made it easier to see what it was trying to be.<br/><br/>Plus I'd read Anne Rice. Also, the Chicago by Night supplement made a huge difference. It introduced relationship maps (for the first time I believe in an rpg product) and it contained a lot of really useful advice (as I recall - it's been a long time since I read it).<br/><br/>I think too though that some games just resonate more with some people than others. I'm not sure there is always a reason we can point to for that. I got the genre and the advice seemed to fit it, I'm too tired right now but I'll try to think of an example where that didn't happen and I had to get help from others to understand how a game was meant to be played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339433/#Comment_339433" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T09:39:42+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  9:39AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate this thread for making me crave an game I can't have (Crimson Cutlass).<br/><br/>Anyway, for those of us who haven't read/played Freemarket, can you explain why you believe it's ahead of its time.

It seemed rude to push the point so I didn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339446/#Comment_339446" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T10:29:22+00:00" title="August 18, 2011 10:29AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>I hate this thread for making me crave an game I can't have (Crimson Cutlass).</blockquote>\nhow do you think i feel? i can't find a copy either.<br/><br/>and i started the damn thread. khan!!!! no. wait. me!!!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339456/#Comment_339456" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T11:02:43+00:00" title="August 18, 2011 11:02AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe someone should direct the rightsholders' attention to this thread?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339464/#Comment_339464" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T11:18:53+00:00" title="August 18, 2011 11:18AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i've been trying to find them, actually                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jcfiala" title="jcfiala"><img alt="jcfiala" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jcfiala">jcfiala</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339480/#Comment_339480" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T12:00:20+00:00" title="August 18, 2011 12:00PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>i've been trying to find them, actually</blockquote>\nWell, it looks like they're still chatting in the forum at <a href="http://www.spacegamer.com/spacegamer/default.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.spacegamer.com/spacegamer/default.asp</a> ?

While I never was a fan of Croc as a game designer, I found the design of this one was very elegant: single d10 for roll, any descriptor can be made a meaningful character trait, rules for managing.the evolution of the group and its implication in the emergent  web of intrigue. Too bad it never really got off the ground.<br/><br/>As for Vampire: my theory on the game is that it was blessed with being unable to do anything really well, yet allow for a wide variety of game-styles to cohabit, sometimes at the same time, around the same table. You had players who wanted their slice of real world D&amp;D, intrigue backstabbing masters, soap-lovers,  those in it for the Gothic horror... and they were all playing together.<br/>Sometimes (often) it was hell to manage, but when it worked it was glorious. And yes, I'd say the game was exactly of its time.<br/><br/>The curse of indie games, for me, has generally ben that while I can find games fine-tuned for each and any category of players, I have trouble finding one who'll be "good-enough" for all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340192/#Comment_340192" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-23T13:20:20+00:00" title="August 23, 2011  1:20PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James Bond.
