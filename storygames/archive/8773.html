So, the main suggestion I have is make sure you're running for a fair number of players, say 4 or 5 at least.  Games with trust mechanics (including Mountain Witch, which strongly inspired Cold City) really benefit from having more players than you might normally want in a personal, high intensity game.  Mountain Witch is gold at 6 or 7 players, actually, which would overwhelm many game tables.<br/><br/>Also, if you're running Cold City, you might consider mining Hot War for ideas, since I think HW reflects more of what Malcolm's learned in the years since Cold City was released.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194313/#Comment_194313" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T05:33:50+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  5:33AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blimey, this wasn't exactly an emphatic response was it?<br/><br/>Someone asks for information about one of the more spoken of indie games at one of the sites that is most particularly aligned with indie games and he gets directed to some publisher-produced stuff and stern warnings that actually the whole thing doesn't work that well in play.<br/><br/>Brings home to me two theories about the RPG scene :<br/><br/>A) RPG reviews published online are effectively worthless (I don't think any of the reviews I've read of the game touched on the concerns viced by the two respondents to this thread) <br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Lots of people buy games, hardly any of these games ever get played (seemingly hardly anyone has actually played Hot War on these forums).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194326/#Comment_194326" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T06:41:50+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  6:41AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, we've played quite a lot of Cold City but as author of part of the book, I thought I should hold back.<br/><br/>In our home game which I ran, we had between 5 and 10 players. 10 is a bit too many really, for any game, not just Cold City, but it was still fun.<br/><br/>I did quite a lot of background reading to understand Berlin in the 50s, and asked my Father in Law about his experiences, he even got a credit, much to his bemusement.<br/><br/>The game we played a home had rather a different feel to the one we played two years running at Gen Con (run by Malc). Given the wide scope for types of players I think there are a couple of things you need to think about when running CC that you don't for HW. Actually you do for HW too, but they're more explicitly covered in the game preparation phase.<br/><br/>These are things about tone and scope.<br/><br/>In one game we had a French petty thief and a Nazi Grand Wizard. The traits were on different scales so you have to work harder as GM and players to make sure that the Wizard doesn't dominate the scenes. That is one character has knife-fighting, the other has embody Thor.<br/><br/>Talk to your players at the start about the kind of things they want in the game and about how powerful they want characters to be. After all, success in a roll doesn't depend much on the difficulty. To the same extent, talk about tone. Is it gritty and low-key, how much humour do you want in the trait names, how much overt magic. Can characters be scared by things (i.e. do they have to make, in effect, SAN rolls)?<br/><br/>Having a set-up scene for each character is a good thing, even if it doesn't require any dice rolling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194391/#Comment_194391" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T08:51:16+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  8:51AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>...directed to some publisher-produced stuff...</blockquote>\nNo, the publisher is helpfully linking to both in-house and external playtests, and Actual Plays, which include their own.<br/><br/>One external AP from December -- <a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/1543" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">[Hot War] Against the French</a> -- takes you through what setting up a game is like and the first couple of sessions.<br/><br/>I do agree that Hot War has not been played much by anyone who now reads or still posts <i>here</i>.<br/><br/>Perhaps Max's request may have been better posted elsewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/warren" title="warren"><img alt="warren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wmerrifield.googlepages.com/GoPlayMario.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/warren">warren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194398/#Comment_194398" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T09:02:13+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  9:02AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2009 9:05AM by warren.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite>One external AP from December --<a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/1543" rel="nofollow">[Hot War] Against the French</a>-- takes you through what setting up a game is like and the first couple of sessions.<br/></blockquote>\nYes, I was going to mention that.

But I'll read charitably.<br/><br/>I, for the record, could be argued to do that. I actively use Google to look for AP of my games and link to them. For two reasons: (1) the main one, is that for a little bit of work by me you can easily find and read AP of my game by people who aren't me and make up your own mind about the game, and (2) a very minor one, that is more for chip-on-the-shoulder reasoning, is to prove some stupid fuck (who's now evaporated into his own cloud of pixels) wrong when he said I wouldn't get any AP.<br/><br/>The bottom line is a lot of people play games and don't write about it -- whether they are good or bad. So, more AP? Better AP? More diverse styel of AP write up? I agree entirely.<br/><br/>But Cold City has been played a hell of a lot (it's been out a few years now, of course it has). A lot of the games of it I've seen at UK cons haven't been written up -- even though they've been successful and hot as hell. Why? Well, a lot of the people running and playing it aren't here on these forums or the sort of gamer that would come here. Cold City is, I think, one of those games that appeals to trad players looking at indie stuff from the edges. Same with Spirit of the Century.<br/><br/>Hot War gets less play as it's new and also relies on the group coming up with the background together -- bigger buy-in and more tree-hugging required. Cold City is more "trad" in that the GM comes up with the world (based on the view of Berlin 1950 from the book) and the players come up with their characters, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>Cold City has an AP page which might help:<a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/coldact.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.contestedground.co.uk/coldact.html</a><br/>Cold City has an AP forum: <a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=39" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.contestedground.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=39</a><br/><br/>You even get the whole System Chapter as a free download: <a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/colddown.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.contestedground.co.uk/colddown.html</a><br/><br/>Scott Dorward runs Cold City like a f'in demon. He's been doing the same with Hot War, but since it's newer he's not run as many. I wonder if he's still around here. If so, he might chime in.<br/><br/>Personally, I ran Cold City 1.0 once and we got a good short game out of it. Being a tinkerer it didn't work the way I would have written it to work, so that made me come up with something else. Malcolm then came out with Hot War and Cold City 1.1, where he tightened up on things. Read the system chapter. It's free. Make up your own mind. You can even run the game using that and then buy the book/don't buy the book depending on how that goes for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott%20Dorward" title="Scott Dorward"><img alt="Scott Dorward" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott%20Dorward">Scott Dorward</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194768/#Comment_194768" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-27T09:56:07+00:00" title="February 27, 2009  9:56AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do still lurk here, and even post sometimes when prodded!<br/><br/>Hot War has become one of my favourite games, and I run it a lot, especially at conventions.  I am, however, terrible about writing AP reports for, well, anything.  I start out with good intentions, but by the time I get around to it, I've forgotten most of the cool stuff that happened.<br/><br/>The world creation routine in HW is wonderful, and has created some very great, dramatic and meaty stuff in my games.  When it comes to running one-offs at conventions, though, I tend to either nick backgrounds and characters from less time-constrained games I've run, or to come up with them myself ahead of time.  This isn't quite as satisfactory, but it makes it feasible to run a game in a three- or four-hour slot.<br/><br/>The one caveat I would offer is a pretty obvious one: make sure all your players are on board with the idea of a game that depends on inter-PC conflict.  I ran one problematical game at a recent convention where a player was deeply unhappy about other PCs being in conflict with his character, and the game lost a lot of its energy as a result.<br/><br/>One tip I'd offer is that if you, as the GM, are hitting the PCs with heavy conflicts which end up giving you loads of points of consequences, spend most of them on giving the PCs negative traits with scary-sounding names (e.g. Blinded, Disfigured, Crippled).  This makes it sound like the character has taken a real battering, but actually makes it more effective and fun and to play, and can have interesting consequences if the trait gives the high die in a future conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sophmelc" title="sophmelc"><img alt="sophmelc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sophmelc">sophmelc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195217/#Comment_195217" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T23:58:04+00:00" title="March  2, 2009 11:58PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run Hot War a few times now and have an actual play on my site if you're interested (though I think Malc has already linked to it) <a href="http://mostlygeek.sucanty.com/tag/hot-war/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://mostlygeek.sucanty.com/tag/hot-war/</a>.<br/><br/>I think Hot War is a great game, one that totally lit the fire of my imagination the first time I read it through (which I did cover to cover, it really was that engaging). Unfortunately I've been unable to get a longer game going, but I'm about to start putting the pressure on my regular gaming group. <br/><br/>I haven't had a chance to play Cold City yet, but I have plans to eventually. Any way all of my thoughts on Hot War (and on cold city for that matter) can be found by clicking on the link above. But I would recommend Hot War with out reservation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195220/#Comment_195220" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-03T01:21:15+00:00" title="March  3, 2009  1:21AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, another AP experience: James Mullen ran a superb game of Cold City at the Milton Keynes RPG club a while ago.  The game didn't get a write-up, but it was excellent.  James had some plot in mind about aliens from another dimension invading people's blood and taking them over (something like a cross between &lt;i&gt;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Blood Music&lt;/i&gt;), but in play we pretty much ended up ignoring that in favour of some black marketeering and chasing after the French ambassador's wife and her infant son of disputed parentage.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Soviet PC ended up spending the rest of his life in Siberia.
