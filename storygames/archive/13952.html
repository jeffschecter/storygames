I think Teataine is on to something. Several times I have endured the situation as GM where I have gone to the trouble to build something that I think will satisfy the players, only to have specific players (yes, very specific people) deliberately go out of the way to grand stand and derail the session just to show how much more clever they are. Possibly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a specific example: it is really hard to run a coherent split party and make sure that everyone gets a fair go and ensuring that no one is advantaged or disadvantaged by hearing what is going on in the other half of the party. So having characters haring off out of the party and doing their own thing (for no good story reason other than they want to make their character do things) is either deliberately or ignorantly disruptive behaviour. It is, in short, childish.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player clearly places trust in a GM in a conventional RPG. But the GM also places an awful lot of trust in the players not to bugger things up. Pretty soon you start to think about ways of controlling the wayward players, rather than trying to all share in a mutual experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera" title="XanatosChimera"><img alt="XanatosChimera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera">XanatosChimera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316704/#Comment_316704" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-15T09:43:04+00:00" title="March 15, 2011  9:43AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ry</cite>What games (and what playstyles, if you're talking about a game that has a lot of approaches) require more/less/different kinds of trust?<br/><br/>Most games, it's important you don't act like a jerk.</blockquote>\nI assume you're referring to in-character acting, not OoC?  If the latter, I'd amend this rule to "In all games it's imperative you don't act like a jerk."  I would liken this to playing a villain in a theatre or movie production.  Just because your character is a jerk or has crossed the moral event horizon, doesn't mean you behave like that out of character.  In and out of character separation is key, methinks.<br/><br/>Games where this is imperative: Wraith, Vampire: the Masquerade, any game that incorporates player vs player conflicts.

This is a good one.  I'd say that full disclosure of the topics you intend to explore prior to play is an absolute prerequisite.<br/><br/>Games where this is something to watch for: Vampire, Wraith, D&amp;D.

(I don't have any books on hand to provide quotes, but I'm sure someone else could.)<br/><br/>Pretty much any story about gaming (e.g. gaming comics like <a href="http://darthsanddroids.net/" rel="nofollow">Darths and Droids</a> or <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=612" rel="nofollow">DM of the Rings</a>) references this issue.<br/><br/>It's clearly a pretty major concern of GM-central games (i.e. most RPGs until fairly recently).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bottlesorter" title="bottlesorter"><img alt="bottlesorter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bottlesorter">bottlesorter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316739/#Comment_316739" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-15T13:54:07+00:00" title="March 15, 2011  1:54PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree entirely, Paul.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have a GM and separate players - separation of duties - you almost automatically have a power struggle. If you have a great bunch of friends all on the same wavelength the division of labour and willingness to let the other fellow do his job makes this traditional role playing incredibly satisfying. Enough to build an entire industry, in fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you don't have harmonious participants it can be a nightmare for everyone. Dictatorial GMs and plot-destructive characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nStory gaming, where the roles are often shared, goes a long way to diffuse this, I think.
