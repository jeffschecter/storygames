A game where you can play dense scenes with lot of action/descriptions and few rolls and few loss of time.<br/>Hollowpoint seems fairly adaptable to any setting.<br/>But, fellow veterans, what can('t) Hollowpoint do?<br/>Obviously I could run some Shadowrun, Star Wars or Warhammer game with it. I even heard about a hollowpoint session based on Skyrim or the Avengers...<br/><br/>But which kind of scenes/mood can't be done with Hollowpoint?<br/>Could it handle investigation/social scenes without a bloodbath?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416467/#Comment_416467" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T06:37:44+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  6:37AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2013 6:38AM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *raises hand*<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5bhvaphmmtk3p3o/AvengerPoint%200.2.pdf" rel="nofollow">Avengers Hollowpoint was me!</a> (It still needs some work IMO, but...)<br/><br/>I'm also working out a hack that turns a lot of Hollowpoint's theme and mechanics on its head to make a high school comedy/drama/romance game.<br/><br/>Investigation/social scenes could totally work. As Brad pointed out in one thread on the G+ community, the key to Hollowpoint is the effects. "What does it look like on the receiving end?" When those effects are bloody and violent, Hollowpoint is a bloodbath. When they're more things like "Found Out" or "Compromised", it's not.<br/><br/>Like, imagine Hollowpoint focused around CON, DIG, COOL, and TAKE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Volsung" title="Volsung"><img alt="Volsung" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Volsung">Volsung</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416559/#Comment_416559" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-18T02:16:50+00:00" title="June 18, 2013  2:16AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2013 2:17AM by Volsung.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Avengers Hollowpoint was me!

There's a few nifty things I'm doing to extend the Hollowpoint framework, but I've essentially re-framed the conflict to use other methods, as well as the effects. And it's actually not all that sandboxy. The way I'm designing it, missions get replaced with Big Events--sorta the idea that something like prom or midterms or the homecoming game becomes an all-encompassing phenomenon that everyone's trying to get something out of.<br/><br/>It's also a lot more heavily PvP in one sense. You're actually throwing in (on at least a meta level) to affect the relationships that other people have towards you, with the stress and other effects of upcoming Big Events limiting your capacity to resist change yourself.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
