This might be the second or third time we've been through this topic, but I'm sure the last time was over a year ago.<br/><br/>If I ever use music while gaming (as GM), I usually put on something, anything, on a low volume to basically serve as the equivalent of white noise to keep me focused.  The reason that I don't implement music more in my games is:<br/><br/>1) Normal volume, it becomes terribly distracting, no matter how much it's supposed to contribute to the game/mood.<br/><br/>2) If it's something I recognize, it can become doubly distracting. Frex, if someone cues up the Conan soundtrack and lets it roll, and the scene shifts to one of my hero buying avocados at a fantasy vegetable market, then we end up with a scene of EPIC AVOCADOS... at which point, if real life was an anime, I'd have one of those "sweat-teardrops" on my head, as well as my character inside the game. It just doesn't fit the mood.<br/><br/>3) The payoff is not enough. Cuing up the perfect song for a scene (especially when there's no music elsewhere in the game) usually seems to be more trouble than its worth.<br/><br/>It may be just that music + me + gaming just don't work in any capacity other than "white noise", but I wanted to hear other peoples' thoughts and tips on effectively using music while gaming.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165598/#Comment_165598" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T06:26:34+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  6:26AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually wrote an article on this a few years back.

They also tend to get psyched up when they hear their song come up, like a wrestler coming to the ring.<br/><br/>It can be distracting, when the wrong song comes up or loops for the 100th time that session. One of the issues is, most songs are less than 3 minutes long. A combat session can take 20+ minutes. So having specific music for an encounter requires a bit of juggling by the GM and can take everyone out of the moment for very little payoff.<br/><br/>Still, I love music during gaming, and I'm always looking for ways to use it in games. I'll be interested in what others have to say.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165607/#Comment_165607" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T06:39:28+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  6:39AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm having the idea of using normally loud music, but only at the beginning of a scene.

Video game music rocks as the tracks tend to loop well and are often hard to recognize.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I created playlists based on scene types: celebration, calm, chanting, chase, club, death, dungeon, entrance heroic, fight fantasy, fight modern, fire, hope love, horror, magic bad, magic good, march, mystery, nature, reborn return, riot, sad, seduction, storm, surprise, suspense, trapped, village town.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to make sure each playlist has at least 3-5 songs so that it doesn't get monotonous for long scenes. I then delete anything that is too recognizable unless being recognizable would be beneficial.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then tend to play music low in the background and only increase the music when it perfectly fits with the actions being described.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I use the music as inspiration for improv GMing.

It is not.<br><br>Good music to a game takes work, it can take as much work to choose the music as it takes to write an old-school adventure. I ran a game of TSOY recently, and I must have listened to hundreds of tunes from my collection before I had chosen the twenty or twentyfive that made it to the playlist.  It is easy to find music that fits the game, the hard part is finding as FEW as possible tunes to match all situations in the game. The players should be able to recognize a tune that comes back.  If you play the 'sad tune' during a sad scene, and you chose your music right, then you can induce a sad mood at the table later by playing that same tune.<br><br>I changed the name on those tunes to match the purpose, the bad guy's theme, the different PC's themes, themes for specific moods, places and scenes. During play I set my player on repeat, repeat on a tune level, so that I had to change manually to get to the next track.  I keep my computer next to me when I GM, the screen illuminates my notes, and I have the player open and on top.  I have learnt the shortcuts in the player so I can switch tracks and adjust the volume with ease, since I want to be able to do these things 'invisibly' while GM'ing.<br><br/>When a specific PC is in focus I can play that PC's tune.  When I introduce new scenes I play appropriate music.  When the players are in a specific mood I can use the music to reflect that (and later to change the mood by reusing that music).  Also I can accent my descriptions with music, eg. when the enemy cavallery charges in I can let the volume creep up as the description becomes more agitated and intense.<br/><br/>I have a special tune for each game that I play before the session starts, we ususally sit and chat at the table before the game begins, when I am ready I start the music and let the players calm down, and when they listen and I have their attention I switch to the right tune for the first scene and get started. <br/><br/>If you want to implement this in your own games, but feel it is a big step to take and worry about having too much to think about there is a very nice way to practice:  Be the DJ for another GMs game. <br/><br/>Take control over the music, make a soundtrack with what you think will match, get some input from the GM and the other players. Then you try to make your best to support the GM with good music during the game while also playing your PC.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165641/#Comment_165641" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T07:54:49+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  7:54AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium, I make playlists -- sinister industrial for the investigation sequences (Le\xe6ther Strip, Assemblage 23, Skinny Puppy), fast-paced industrial metal for the mook brawls (Fear Factory, KMFDM, Godflesh), and death metal for the final confrontation with the demon (Nile, Bolt Thrower, Napalm Death).

Should a particular track <i>really</i> not match the scene we're playing, I just skip it, and OTOH, if I <i>really</i> want a track for a scene I just cue it up. Otherwise, I keep it quite low so we can speak at normal volume.<br/><br/>Recently I have had to run games in a venue where I can't use music (the FLGS) and to be honest, I really miss having it. If I'm playing in someone else's game, I'm hoping they'll have some tunes going too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165686/#Comment_165686" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T10:03:29+00:00" title="August 27, 2008 10:03AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once upon a time, when I ran lots of moody <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>, I'd actually have creepy music ready to go and all that kind of stuff.<br/><br/>Nowadays, I like to have somewhat appropriate music in the background, mostly to fill the dead quiet spaces that you can get.

It takes a lot of work to get it right.<br/><br/>I used to use music a lot.  I would spend hours at the record store, listening to album tracks from various demo machines (a nearby tower had a system where you could scan a CD and listen to track portions for almost everything in the store), sticking to movie sountracks and intrumental (mostly world) music. For an Exalted game, I got about 5 CD of mostly world music (DJ Chen i Shabbah, dhol foundation, Kodo drumming, etc) for a sampling of tracks, filled out with some from my collection, like my favorite: Faith No More's "Woodpecker From Mars" for the theme of a Wyld twisted villain.  Then there would be the work of listening to all the tracks from all the albums I'm considering, and cataloging what each one is good for. Combat tracks, character themes, conversation (relaxed), conversation (tense), dark and spooky, etc.  Then, I'd have the CD player next to me, with my music notes, ready to swap stuff out and put on a track looping when needed.<br/><br/>I avoid lyrics whenever possible unless it's really important to have them. For a cyberpunk Werewolf game, I had one industrial-techno song with a chorus of "Gaia is the Earth" that was used for a lot of combats, but the lyrics were so "chant" like they worked more like percussion, and faded into the background. For the Exalted game, I used Our Lady Peace's "Middle of Yesterday" as the closing credits because the lyrics fit the focus of the game, the lost past and memories of their previous lives (and in proper anime style - all the music during the game was genre appropriate, and the credits was a modern song).<br/><br/>I don't do it much anymore. I tried for Dogs in the Vineyard, but scenes are so much more intense and fast paced that by the time I remember music either the scene is almost over or the song from two scenes before is still looping. Plus, it was tough finding the right music and since record stores are pretty much dead, it's harder to just find new music without relying on luck and streaming stations or browsing iTunes, which I haven't really explored.  But more to the point, the games I play lately just move too quickly for scoring them too music, and more and more don't have anything I can score in advanced. Gameplay is just too unpredictable. Part of the reason I could before was due to the power of structure as a GM. But I'm less and less interested in hording that power.  The closest I've come is Primetime Adventures, and for that I am just picking one song, editting it down to around 30 seconds in Garage Band, to function as the show's Theme song - after the pilot session, of course.  I don't plan to even try to score the gameplay.  So, I could do theme songs like that, and character themes, but not to the extent that I have in the past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165803/#Comment_165803" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T15:04:32+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  3:04PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find music works fine as long as it doesn't have singing (or at least, no understandable lyrics)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve%20H" title="Steve H"><img alt="Steve H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve%20H">Steve H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165821/#Comment_165821" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T16:42:54+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  4:42PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I once made up some sound scapes for an Arcana Evolved game, I had insects for the swamp with crazy howls in the background every now and then, drips in the caverns.

I also had some sound effect cds for things like taverns and crowded streets that I would use as low-volume background stuff, and some stuff i hacked together in Audacity for special events, like storms. For creepy scenes, and some action scenes, I'd switch to movie soundtrack stuff, like the soundtrack from Cold Lazarus, which is great. I rarely used anything for combats though.<br/><br/>More recently I did a one off game where I compiled a detailed scene by scene soundtrack that i controlled from itunes, and as Alvin says it took forever. I listened to half the music I owned, borrowed stuff, even bought some music specifically for the game. In practice it had mixed results, especially in the combat scenes where the tunes ran out too soon, or repeated too often, and I'd say it was a lot less successful than the mood music.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165884/#Comment_165884" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T05:22:24+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  5:22AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a big trick to using music in your game is to understand what you are using it for. Does it contain auditory clues, like an animal growling, or a bell chiming or someone talking? Is there a part of the lyrics that have an in-game effect, like a riddle or giving insight into another character? Is it background noise or helping to set the scene?<br/><br/>Since RPGs are primarily narrative (someone is describing the scene and the things the characters do and see) you don't want something that is going to interfere with that. A good description is worth more than cool background music. I think the trick is to decide if the music is going to enhance the game or if it will distract from the game, and that can vary depending on what you are playing, what kind of music you have and how easily distracted your players tend to be.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/max.lambertini" title="max.lambertini"><img alt="max.lambertini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lambertini.org/foto_max_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/max.lambertini">max.lambertini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165888/#Comment_165888" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T06:46:44+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  6:46AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some years ago, I wrote the stub of an RPG that used music as part of its action resolution mechanic. <br/><br/>It worked this way: Players would receive (or choose) three cards which represented their characters' fortes. Every card was coupled to a tune (it was GM's responsibility to prepare the soundtrack).<br/><br/>The game would flow in a rather freeform/diceless way until a player chose to play a card. This not only gave his character some bonus, it also triggered the aforementioned tune, and an one-to-one 4-minute realtime roleplaying session, would ensue. <br/><br/>I demoed it twice at local conventions: all in all, it was fun, even if I reckon that it's very difficult to match all of the group's musical tastes and ideas of 'appropriate soundtrack', and a bad soundtrack could totally ruin your roleplaying experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165892/#Comment_165892" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T07:31:05+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  7:31AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I used to use music to do that thing that Remi does so well using more direct means:  Getting folks in the right head-space before the game.</p>\n<p>I'd steal a bit o' soundtrack that I felt was appropriate, and then I'd play it at the start of each session for that chapter.

The game was a more-or-less conventional supernatural mystery, with songs used similarly to how they're used in prime-time TV - I had chosen a small pool of ten or so songs for scenes I expected the narrative might go toward during game-prep, and faded them in from a very quiet background instrumental at key scenes. As part of the meta-narrative of the game, the characters were aware of the music, in much the manner of a slightly self-aware show; it was a violation of the fourth wall, but it was considered in-character and appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe approach took a lot of work - I think my GMing suffered for it, and I haven't repeated the experiment - but there was a lot of promise in it, too. In particular, the music was able to act as a back-channel for emotional content, with the tone set by the songs summarizing scenes or making the players reconsider the emotions of what just happened. I found it worked well to use full songs, but fade them in to full volume for only ten to thirty seconds - a cue I picked up from watching how lyrical music gets used in TV and movies. It's enough time for the players to get the tone, before it fades back down to be subservient to their story again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166738/#Comment_166738" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-03T05:55:00+00:00" title="September  3, 2008  5:55AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2008 5:56AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite>I made a Dogs in the Vineyard soundtrack for myself to listen to, then distributed copies to all my players to use <i>on their way to the game</i>.</blockquote>\nThis is an awesome idea.

It's a personal thing, I suspect.  I know that I love movies where awesome actions are supported and heightened by awesome music.  I know that I like to make the principal characters of the game look awesome.  I know that I have a terrible memory and like getting players in on as much "co-gming" as possible.<br/><br/>So my idea was to first have a series of thematic tracks that each are named after a high-level verb of the campaign, something that the players say they are interested in doing. "Delving into the savage jungle."  "Chasing or being chased."  "Infiltrating Castles."  "A Pitched Battle."  Once per session, players can call to start the track.  As long as it's playing, everyone gets a bonus to actions of that general sort.  Delving, chasing, etc. <br/><br/>Then, each principal character also gets a song, and once per session, when the character fulfills some condition, the song can be played, and as long as it's played, the character gets some bonus.<br/><br/>The specifics would necessarily have to vary with the system.  Involved in preparations for a <em>Weapons of the Gods</em> game, that was <a href="http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/themes.html" rel="nofollow">the example</a> I produced.  Everyone got a +5 from thematic tracks, as if they had "Quality Theme Music."  Whenever a character earned a deeds point (I.E., whenever he did something successful and stylish that supported one of the in-genre heroic or villainous virtues, I.E., whenever he did something that fit the game and his character), he had the option to start his personal soundtrack, during which time he would have a customized "Minor Chi Condition" that could have his choice of a few different bonuses.<br/><br/>I planned to give soundtracks to NPCs as well, but rather than give them bonuses to their rolls, I thought that, while the track was playing, I would award Destiny (I.E., experience points) to any players that narrated their characters as being threatened or flummoxed by the actions of the bad (or competetive or obstructing or just annoying) guy.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a shame I never got to try it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167291/#Comment_167291" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T13:40:35+00:00" title="September  5, 2008  1:40PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No one mentioned using sound effects CDs during play?
