I don't mind signing up to "pay in full no later than the day of the game", but I'm worried I'll be in breach of contract if I fail to "Follow all rules and regulations of the chosen game".<br/><br/><i>Graham: It was an accident! I just forgot to change my hit points!<br/>Elliott: Too late. You broke the contract, Walmsley. Get out.</i><br/><br/>Seriously, it's a funny mix of important financial obligations (e.g. "Only run games when at least two players are present") and social obligations. Also, I think you'll freak new players out if you ask them to sign a document guaranteeing they'll "attempt to clearly set the stakes".<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58716/#Comment_58716" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T09:23:32+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  9:23AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2007 9:24AM by Elliott Belser.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/>Graham,<br/><br/>Point well made.
