Some more info:<br/><br/>Rebellion:<br/><br/>During the character creation process, you pause to frame a scene involving at least one other YO that shows the first time you ever really rebelled against the Authority. At the end of the scene, you wind up with a new trait that you write from scratch a la the accomplishment scene from Dogs in the Vineyard.\n<ul>\n<li>Pros:\n<ul>\n<li>This serves the purpose of teaching you how to write an open trait (up until this point they have all been "pick from this list").</li>\n<li>This begins to provide backstory and cement the relationships between the YOs.<br/></li><li>It's a low-stakes (no pun intended) way of introducing the rule mechanics.</li>\n<li>It gets some of the GM (The Authority) resources spent and usable as Cool points to be given away during play.</li>\n</ul>\nCons:\n<ul>\n<li>If done at convention games, it could really slow things down because it makes character creation take quite a long time.</li>\n<li>I feel a little funny blowing Authority resources before things get going.</li>\n<li>The "Rebellion" trait is weird and unmotivated and unclear on when you would use it when compared to the other traits (Means, Motivation, Mistreatment, Schtick, Signature Item).</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\nRelationship traits:<br/><br/>This is the new idea I had and I'm somewhat excited about it. MY is meant to be a lot about friendships and unity, and in this way you would get rid of the Rebellion trait and have a new one for each of your co-YOs that would be blank until you had your first scene with them. At that point, it would be an openly authored trait like Schtick and Signature Item are (I call these Open traits, and ones you select from a list (Means, Motivation, Mistreatment) are called Closed traits). These traits would only be usable when you were in conflict with that person or providing Help to that YO in a conflict.\n<ul>\n<li>Pros:\n<ul>\n<li>In the game, when you use a trait, and you lose (and rarely even if you win), it can be flipped and become a Sold trait (a negative, Authority-tinged one). This is great because if you are in a conflict against this person, or if you're in aid of this person and place your opinion of them on the line, it can wind up getting soured or perverted by the Authority.</li>\n<li>Stats about other PCs are just cool in my opinion.</li>\n<li>Character creation goes faster.</li>\n</ul>\nCons:\n<ul>\n<li>I dunno, a more cluttered character sheet?</li>\n<li>A stat you can't use as often as Rebellion.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\nAnyway, what do you think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70825/#Comment_70825" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T11:27:05+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 11:27AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, <br/><br/>Couldn't MY's accomplishment scene have a fixed income and not come out of the  economy?<br/><br/>I'd think that Relationship Traits will be quite useful in the act of rebelling.<br/><br/>That's all I got.<br/><br/>Good luck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70833/#Comment_70833" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T11:32:53+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 11:32AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Judd. And yeah, you're right. The Rebellion scene might have a set number of Authority Points that could be used.<br/><br/>It's been pointed by others out that without understanding how my conflict system works, this means nothing. So let me explain.<br/><br/>Resolution is achieved with a kind of craps game. On the initial throw of 2 six-sided dice, you win if you hit a 7 or 11 and you lose if you hit a 2, 3, or 12. If 7, 11, 2, 3, or 12 are not hit, you win with whatever number is rolled, and you lose if a 7 is rolled. So:<br/><br/>I roll, I get a 9<br/><br/>I do not win and neither does the Authority, I then have to go back to rolling until I get a 9 or the Authority gets a 7.<br/><br/>Now that could take forever, so you can wager your traits, one per roll, on a number. So for this pass, I already have 9. I also buy 10. I have to wager one of my stats to buy 10. If I lose, something bad happens (often meaning my stat "flips" and becomes a negative, Authority-tinged version of the stat, so if it's Pride it becomes Egomania).<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Is that any clearer? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
