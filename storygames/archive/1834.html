                            An early draft of <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> turned out to strongly reinforce self-denial as the best way to elicit the attention and compassion of others.  I label that version (in my mind) the "Suicide Training Game."                        </div>

                            I think it's the low-key stuff that has the potential to be scary. If you play a serial killer, it's assumed you'll kill people and shit, but when you play a soccer-mom and take someone's eye out, that's scary.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tadk</cite>I want to know more about your game Tony</blockquote>
Well, I think my current design is stirring up some of my issues (in a good way). It's touching on religion, culture, and politics in a way that's kind of touched a vein with me. It may be that it's providing a "safe" way to ask some serious questions, which, if it works, is way cool by me. In my game, ideas can kill people. They can launch revolutions and destry societies. In the hands of PCs, ideas are scary. The closest paralell I can think of is D&amp;D. In D&amp;D, demons can beat you up, but they're not existentially scary. They're just monsters in the end. In Sorceror, demons can corrupt your soul. THAT is scary, making Sorceror a very scary game for me.                        </div>

                            There was a recent podcast on GeeksOn about roleplaying (21/9) where they examined racism. Playing in a Vietnam war game meant dealing with some of the racist issues of the time and they discussed how it made them FEEL when they were playing characters that "ought" to have been racist according to the times. This was brought home when playing in a Delta Green game where my character, a ex-OSI servicement who was used to interrogating Iraqis in Gulf 1.0, was tasked to interrogate a 15 year old american kid. I replied "I'm not sure I could do that to an American." There was a pause in the group as they considered what the character had just said, what I had just said. (I'm not American for the record, it was just a character). <br/>
I don't think that many games are "bad" in that sense. I think that there are some good GMs who can evoke emotional responses and there are some people who might not to be up to playing an emotionally charged game. I think that games and books and films might help expose an already damaged psyche.                        </div>

                            Hmm, I am refering to something deeper than the themes are too raw or too controversial. I'm not including That Oh So Little Death in that list, for example. In fact, the worst offender of mine is Savagery, a RPG about social and emotional conflict - a pervasive subject matter. Yet, multiple prospective playtesters have been worried about playing it and literally breaking friendships in the process. <br/>
<br/>
Tony (LB), your example of Misery Bubblegum seems right up that alley. Not sure about some of the others. <br/>
<br/>
Tony (dowler), why does the game scare you? Are there memetic or social structures in the game that you feel are hazardous to your way of thinking? Do you feel that the game could be a loaded gun aimed at your relationships, emotional well-being, or immediate sanity? <br/>
<br/>
Guy, Savagery is entirely without fantasy elements. I played them down from Fight Club, one of the inspirations, because the game is really about the violence people will do to each other, as long as it isn't physical. Part of the risk could lie in the lack of escapism. <br/>

Sounds like that discussion may have needed to happen. I'm glad it was only "almost".                        </div>

                            I know for my part as an RPG Player, Dogs in the Vineyard was something I avoided for a long, long time because I didn't want to deal with "those issues".  I have a lot of feelings about organized religion and the ever spiraling controversy on who's got it "right", who's got it "wrong" and what makes a person capable of making those judgment calls against someone else.  The very idea of running around in a pack of Mormon Evangelical Frank Castles just sent my hackles up.<br/><br/>Eventually I was worn down and gave it a try, and admit I had fun.  But I had to do some serious compartmentalizing.  I don't particularly subscribe to any religion in general (though if pressed, I identify most with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism" rel="nofollow">Humanism</a> movement), but am bombarded daily in my American life with the Bush Administrations flavor of Neo-Conservatism fueled by the Christian Right and all the backlash that comes there of.  I couldn't imagine a game that not only took that ideology up as a theme but practically reveled in.  I assumed it'd be constant bickering and picking apart of people's belief structures.  It turned out not to be, but I didn't gleen that from reading.  I had to get that from actual play.                        </div>

                            When I was working on Vesperteen, I got into several discussions with folks about it being dangerous, especially when it came to playing middle schoolers (as opposed to high schoolers) getting their first tastes of sin (especially Lust). I also had a bunch of discussions about Jason Blair's Little Fears (the inspiration for Vesperteen) and the wisdom and/or morality of trying to write something along the same lines and whether it could be done in a way that was appropriately frighting and disturbing but also responsible. I haven't found the answer to some of those concerns yet, but I hope to start those discussions up again once I start working on Vesperteen again.                        </div>

                            I crewed a LARP which was viewed as dangerous and wrong by plenty of people.<br/><br/>Basically the players were plane passengers who were kidnapped by terrorists.  They were blindfolded and bound, then interrogated really rather harshly (by me actually). It went on for hours.  Genuine psychological torture techniques were employed, although no one was in any real physical danger at any point, and also if anyone felt overwhelmed they knew they could stop and go out of character.  Infact only one player asked us to go a little easier on them.  And it wasn't the stress positions that got to her, it was the shouting and verbal abuse.  But she stayed in character and continued, we just toned down the shouting.  The kidnap interrogation part of the LARP probably lasted about 3-4 hours but seemed a lot longer I think.<br/><br/>Following reports of what had gone on, plenty of people told us we were sick and wrong and that it was dangerous and twisted.  People were quiet angry about it, some other members of the LARP community thought we'd overstepped some kind of boundary.<br/><br/>The players however without exception loved it, and all refer to it as one of the best LARPs they ever attended.<br/><br/>That was HARDCORE as I understand it.                        </div>

                            Okay, just as a point of clarification, are we talking about <em>dangerous</em> games here, or are we talking about <em>threatening</em> games?

Thanks for bringing up Dogs! For my own personal purposes, Dogs represents the best treatment of religious questions in an RPG I've ever seen. I have huge admiration for Vincent for doing it. I can totally see it as being threatening because it deals with real issues in a real way.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>Tony (dowler), why does the game scare you? Are there memetic or social structures in the game that you feel are hazardous to your way of thinking? Do you feel that the game could be a loaded gun aimed at your relationships, emotional well-being, or immediate sanity?</blockquote>
That's not an easy question to answer. And let's be clear here that we're talking about an initial design that may not even work. That said, the game is scary because it has the potential to pose questions that I often avoid discussing in real life. I avoid discussing them for a variety of reasons; either I've found that you have to choose very carefuly who you discuss them with, or I don't have an adequate answer for them myself, or because I don't think they should ever be asked lightly. <br/>What kind of game would Dogs be if the mechanics supported consequence-free blowing away of entire towns in the ostensible name of God? Now if you want, you can do that in a Dogs game. But the mechanics don't support it because the mechanics have consequences built in. In my opinion that makes Dogs a dangerous but responsible game.<br/>Now let's look at D&amp;D. Am I the only person whose noticed that in its recent incarnations, D&amp;D has portrayed the "monster" races more and more as being driven by the same sorts of motivations, passions, and needs as the non-monster races? And yet the mechanics still strongly support mowing them down like animals. Nobody seems to mind this much, however, since the mechanics also support an almost cartoony seperation from reality. That's why to me D&amp;D isn't particularly dangerous, but also doesn't let me get at the interesting questions.<br/>How about Burning Sands: Jyhad? This is a game where the mechanics support playing a group of Jihadis using terrorism to overthrow the state, or playing a government that perpetuates acts of violence against its populace because that the lesser of two evils. That's pretty dangerous. On the other hand, these are also choices I will never be in a position to make personally. I find the game gives me a safe territory to approach questions that I encounter in the real world every day, and I enjoy it.<br/>How about Sorceror? I'm about to buy this game. I've always been afraid of Sorceror because (as I understand it), it puts the player in a position to act out contact with evil beings that have the power to corrupt them. To me that's about as scary a think as I can think of. This is undoubtedly dangerous. Now that my group is thinking about playing Sorceror, I'll have to read the game and figure out what I actually think of it. <br/>That's more of a walk in the park than a straight answer and maybe not very helpful in the final analysis.                        </div>

                            Joshua, I'm talking about apparent potential for psychological or cognitive effects that are prominent enough to cause concern from potential players. I trust the positive judgement (prominent effects) much more than the normative one (cause for concern). <br/>
<br/>
Broadly speaking there seems to be three classes of this:<br/>
<br/>
1) Difficult Themes - Dogs in the Vineyard, Sorcerer, and so on. Games that concentrate on themes for which some players have risky vulnerabilites. <br/>
<br/>
2) Emotional or Social Dissonance - Savagery, Breaking the Ice, not sure what else. Beyond themes, these games potentially encourage social or personal behaviors that players do not desire. <br/>
<br/>
3) Cognitive Dissonance - Transmutation (wish I had an outside example). Playing this game potentially encourages cognitive patterns or worldviews that players do not desire to have.<br/>
<br/>
#1 seems to be the easiest, and least problematic. There may be nothing pervasive about the risk, only a surface concern about the topics. <br/>
<br/>
#2 seems to occur when the fantasy is stripped, and the system is married to the themes. Thus it is not the topic of the game, but the playing itself that is 'dangerous'. <br/>
<br/>
#3 seems to be rather different. Playing the game requires you to think differently about the world, in a pervasive (and often subtle) manner. <br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>How many RPGs have you designed for which other roleplayers have told you they are too dangerous for them to play? I'm speaking here of fear of psychological or social harm.</blockquote>
Do freeform scenarios count? I have two tabletop scenarios which have had the effect. One from which at least one player has declined to play when I described the theme (social issues between characters that will most probably turn bad and this is strongly encouraged), in which we agreed that playing the scenario could be depressing to her.<br/><br/>Another similar scenario in which the characters are bound to drown (and resurrect after that, with hard moral choices following); I had a player who had had a near-drowning experience of which I didn't know until she told me after playing. She told me that the experience was rather vivid and scary, but that she was okay with that - and that the real life experience enchanted the roleplaying experience (kind of a catharsis). No harm done, but I would rather have known about it beforehand. I ended up clarifying the scenario descriptions more after that.<br/><br/>Also, the kind of larps that Drew (rrr123) described tend to come with a warning in them and usually either have a screening process in which a player can choose the "level" of social/psychological/physical well-being during the event or are invitation only in which the possibility of stressfull events is told to players beforehand. Both kinds usually come with some kind of safety notes or rules. A lot of larps are built around these stressfull things and players both know it and want it. I wouldn't consider them to be too dangerous, if the players know beforehand that stressfull issues are bound to come up during the event.                        </div>

I'd actually agree with this 100% -- but I'm less bothered by that then most, I think.  That said, I still don't think I could play in a convention setting.  Too many unfamiliar people/elements that I'm not comfortable with/geek boys getting the *completely* wrong idea about what kind of "relationship" we might be building.                        </div>

First, the whole "neccisary no bullshit violence" angle on the cowboy Sorcerer idea. I think the reaction that came out to it was indication of it. The other was the "put the sins into the hat" idea, which totally made me go buh, even though I'd been expecting something like it. <br><br/>Also, for the record, I think those moment of danger are probably some of the highest lights of your design.

                            Hi Laura and Brand,<br/>
<br/>
I greatly appreciate those sentiments! Perhaps I'll scribble up some Azk'Arn material for all of us to play one day. Here's some more detail about the stuff you've commented on.<br/>
<br/>
My response to the original tits-comment was to shrug and to say, "They already are." Which is pretty much what I'm saying in the book - (a) that denying the existence of gender and sexuality of the real people present is futile and carries its own dangers; and (b) accepting the existence thereof does not automatically entail abuse and exploitation, but rather provides power and fun.<br/>
<br/>
Did you see my writeup of publicly playing Bacchanal at GenCon? Very enlightening. Not dangerous. On the other hand, I do agree with you that some of my preferred angles in role-playing are just not stuff I'd do at a convention, that is, outside of the Embassy Suites scene which has its own functional social rules.<br/>
<br/>
Brand, quick clarification - the setting in question was modern, not old-west. I remain most interested in the flat-out positive reactions from Christopher Kubasik and Chris Chin, and it was also a bit of a surprise to see how many of the most vocal people recanted their initial reactions to me later. Positioning oneself in a negative context to me is unfortunately a bit of a status game in the shared blog-space and at this website; that apparently was a golden opportunity to do so that many could not resist.<br/>
<br/>
Brand, if you're interested in the latest development of the real-actions/hat notion (I believe Vincent originally called it "dangerous and wrong" although his current view is otherwise), then please get in touch by email.<br/>
<br/>
I continue to think that what's <i>obviously and terribly dangerous </i>in gamer culture is quite well inside the line of acceptable, even casual fun to anyone else. I still think the stuff in Sex &amp; Sorcery is equivalent in "danger" to a game of Twister among adults. Less pleasantly, I saw a men/women gender-war board game recently which went about a million miles farther than I've ever done in any game, and in an ideological direction I find repugnant to boot (i.e. stereotypes, contemptuous humor, et cetera).<br/>
<br/>

                            Hey Ron, <br>
<br>
I feel like I'm out of the loop a little here.  I've read Sex and Sorcery, as well as all of your other books in the Sorcerer line, and I don't remember anything along the lines of a "real actions in a hat" set-up.  Also, I'm not at my place right now and don't have access to my books to find out for sure.  Is my sleep deprived brain playing tricks on me, or did this idea pop up elsewhere?  Was this something that came up Spione?  <br>
<br>
And, on topic, the only game that I've ever made, and is still in production, is Criminal Element.  I don't know if I'd consider it dangerous truly, i think instead that it is only as dangerous as the players want it to be.  As a game about bank heisters and con men, it is a game in which players portray characters with poor morals.  Also, the game's core is the concept of need, and how it can warp a person.  As such, the game has a mechanic in which the GM can push a PC into succumbing to his own worse desire at any moment in a story.  In previous playtests this has introduced anything from mainlining hard drugs and freaking out to a PC attempting to rape an NPC.  This was, obviously, something that had to be talked about at the table amongst the players.  <br>

                            The experience that comes to mind here was a playtest session of the Drifter's Escape in my Shanghai gaming group.  Three players, so a tight little game.  Two men and one woman, the woman and I were both single people of a similar age and clearly feeling each other out as potential partners (possibly of interest: she's my girlfriend now.)  The other man was (and is) in a long term committed relationship.  I'm the devil, she's the man, he's the drifter.<br><br>Anyway, there's a meth-addicted girl the drifter is going to see who's become the nexus of a whole lot of dreams and demands, not to mention a ton of non-immediate but extreme danger.  I have the demand out "have sex with her," the man has "put fear into her" and the drifter has "keep her safe."  She's staying in a cheap motel and she won't open the door.  So, anyway, that's a deal, and he gets it in with the exchange that he hurts her.  We decide that he kicks down the door into her chin, sending her sprawling.  He starts screaming and yelling and suddenly they're throwing things and fighting physically.<br><br>And we look at the demands and realize how damned close we are to a rape scene.<br><br>Honestly, how we resolved it isn't important to the thread topic.<br><br>yrs--<br/>--Ben<br/><br/>P.S.<br/><br/><i>and it was also a bit of a surprise to see how many of the most vocal people recanted their initial reactions to me later</i><br/><br/>Was that a chance to recant publically?

<p>I wrote a game about child endangerment and another one about personal politics. Apparently, 200 people have so far bought it, but many have said that they "can't play it with [their] group." I don't think the issue is a Technique one. I think it's that they're both about stuff that's personally important to the players, and I think a lot of players think (assume?) that they can handle it, but their fellows can't. That means to me that  many people are playing with people they either don't trust or don't respect. I threw up my hands and moved to a different state when I realized I was in that category because I really care about finding out more about my friends and myself through this medium.</p>

Then, despite maturity, these assumptions are carried forward simply out of "that's how you play role-playing games." The suggestion "let's play a role-playing game" continues to suggest an experience about as emotionally threatening as a game of poker.

<br/>
I suggest that even the mutual understanding that makes poker (specifically) functional is often considered impossible by gaming groups. Poker relies on a shared understanding that people will be utterly ruthless toward one another in order to <i>take their money</i>. Even the comparatively minor esteem involved in Gamist role-playing is, as you know, regarded with loathing by many gamers.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding eroticism, if anyone's interested, this was my latest writeup: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21042.0" rel="nofollow">[Bacchanal] GenCon demos and more</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think anyone was using this topic to accuse gamers of being emotionally stunted misanthropes.<br/>

I'd submit that there's very few people (gamer or not) who would readily accept "let's pretend that you and I have a radically different relationship than we do in real life."  Be that friends pretending to be really enemies, casual friends pretending to be lovers, straight people pretending to be gay, peers pretending to have a radical power bias.  Masking that with the indirection of "let's first pretend to be different people" or even "let's actually only say what made up people are doing, like they're our puppets" doesn't go very far to reduce the strength of that proposal: let's play around with our relationship - whatever that relationship is.<br><br>Some of the most dire glares I ever got across a gaming table was when I was playing the NPC lesbian girlfriend of a PC whose player was involved with another player.  "This is okay with everybody?" "Yeah, we're all cool.  I'll just keep glaring at you."                        </br></br></div>

                            Hi Judson,<br/>
<br/>
Here's my take: that what you describe is common in a minor form in many or most grown-up leisure activities - when couples are split up across teams or groups. That happens way more often, in my experience anyway, than having the couples play as teams. I like to observe, participate in, and consider such activities, and also to see them happening in my role-playing experiences.<br/>
<br/>
I think the key is the mask you mentioned. If we put aside "role-playing" in the <i>literal </i>sense as the primary act of the activity, and utilize it instead as a fairly minor technique that may or may not get employed by individuals, then the mask is no mask at all. And then, without it as a confounding factor, functional versions of the "risk" we're talking about here emerge pretty easily, or at least that's how it's been for me.<br/>
<br/>
I think your anecdote is awesome; it fits right in with the testimonials I used in Sex &amp; Sorcery.<br/>
