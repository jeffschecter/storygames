This isn't solely a question about traditional games like D&amp;D since TSOY too had XP.<br/><br/>If you have to define XP to clarify your statement, go ahead. I assume that XP, in the end, increases the power/effectiveness of the character. Even XP spent in TSOY to buy a new Key presumably does so because the player wants to move the character to that mode of play and thus get more XP.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228618/#Comment_228618" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T16:33:02+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  4:33PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I assume  XP to mean any sort of resource that is used to strengthen the PCs' capabilities over time, usually permanently (or at least in a stable manner); this resource generally derives from successful actions in a highly valued realm of achievement (combat, f'r instance). <br/><br/>That being said...<br/><br/>Personally, I think this would lend itself to play involving shorter, more to-the-point stories.<br/>If the element of "advancement" manifests only in-story (new NPC allies, cool gear, etc.) or in-character (the player portrays the character differently over time in some great or small way), then there's no "level" to get to, no place one has to reach before the character has "arrived".

Cutting it out entirely wouldn't have really done that much since the Burning Wheel XP systems seem only to really engage in long-term play.  So I guess my answer is... it doesn't do that much as long as you can sustain interesting play without advancement. Most indie games (like Mouse Guard) have a lot of situation generators that are really cool without needing advancement to keep changing the stakes / tactics. Even in TSOY, you could easily have Keys generate something besides XP, like tokens that gave you +1 when spent on rolls.

The Pool's system of character creation has to do with writing down a short bio of your character, extrapolating skills from that, giving them bonuses (but I forget how). To advance you continue the character's bio at the end of each session with some word limit (there is a word limit for creation as well).

It's a issue because a lot of gamers are trained to expect the XP power-ups. It can become one of the major psychological payoffs for playing (and WoW draws on that big-time), to the extent that it's hard to float anything different. I've certainly played with people who are all about making their character "more powerful". But in the source material this is rarely apparent, at least in the sense of developing higher skills or funky powers. It tends to be more about the characters being iconic, such that they don't need to change.<br><br>(If you think all that's tough for fantasy, try doing superheroes.)<br><br/>I've wrestled with experience a bit in the revision of my Albion game. It's phrased as "investment", sinking some points into an aspect of the character at the time a trigger event comes up, which could be spending a week with the local fencing master or surviving a fiery attack. As well as improving skills, learning spells, etc, characters can gain 'feats' making them better at aspects of a skill or other stuff like having a reputation with a certain group of people, and can give their gear 'weavings' to make it better at certain kinds of thing in the future. They can also invest in a one-off semi-magical result from a skill use. It's all half a step away from standard XP stuff.<br/><br/>I guess one approach is to give options for characters to "improve" in ways that are more about the story than 'levelling up".                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228681/#Comment_228681" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T04:33:28+00:00" title="August 30, 2009  4:33AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In our current not-Heroquest-at-all-anymore campaign, we're doing it like this:<br/>\n- During the game, the players can ask "campaign questions" - "what's the governor's secret plan?", "what lies beyond the Mountains of Ming?", stuff like that.<br/>\n- The GM sets up relevant quests for the questions.<br/>\n- When a quest is fulfilled, the characters all level up at the same time.<br/>\n- When they level up, they can get higher stats, or skills, or life points, or more spells.

If XP is used to get to the next level, I'd prefer to just have levelling up be on a per session or per adventure basis - at whatever point the players get the hang of their current abilities, and would like some more stuff to play with, level them up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228685/#Comment_228685" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T06:19:32+00:00" title="August 30, 2009  6:19AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2009 6:20AM by Tim_Gray.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>I like the idea of removing XP.

Having more kewl powerz through XP is one way of advancing, and having more kewl powerz through a magic amulet is another way of advancing.

I am actually on topic.<br/><br/>Luke Crane, Thor Olavsrud, Rob Bohl, Keith Senkowski, Kevin Allen Jr, Jared Sorensen and I had a really interesting conversation on Wednesday at Gen Con after the Diana Jones Award ceremony. It was about roleplaying as an emergent property of early D&amp;D. Kevin and I think later editions of d20 and D&amp;D don't actually provoke roleplaying, that any roleplaying that happens is only because roleplaying is part of gaming culture. But we're not sure what exactly it was about early D&amp;D that provoked roleplaying. Since that conversation I've been calling roleplaying a "Woodstock94" effect; you know how everyone got naked and slid around in the mud at the Woodstock '94 event commemorating the 25th anniversary of Woodstock, just the way everyone did at Woodstock in 1969? They did it because they'd seen the Woodstock movie, not because public nakedness was a part of the larger 1994 cultural zeitgeist. Roleplaying in D&amp;D 4e is something you do because it adheres to the culture from having been an emergent property of early games.<br/><br/>And for what it's worth, I think a lot of designers are thinking that with the later success of focused indie style games, that we've lost something important. We've ushered up a trend of character play being eclipsed by mechanics-focused authoring. We've lost a lot of the roleplaying from the hobby. It's a concern you can see a lot of indie designers worrying at.<br/><br/>I wrote a letter of "advice to Italian roleplayers on having an enjoyable time with My Life with Master" prior to the publication of the Italian translation in which I characterize the problem as "workshopping" the narrative. (Their forums appear to be down currently, or I'd link you to it.) Vincent's terminology for the solution is "leading with the fiction" (which addresses the "flogging the mechanics" part, but leaves too much room for players authoring at each other for my gaming tastes). Joe McDonald calls the desired activity "character resolution". Christian Griffen writes a good blog post about it here: <a href="http://www.berengad.com/blog/?p=40" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.berengad.com/blog/?p=40</a><br/><br/>Anyway, I recently described the Gen Con conversation to Chris Perrin, and asked what he thought it was about early RPGs that produced roleplaying as an emergent property, and his answer was "character advancement"...and he clarified that advancement is about successive goals, and:<br/><br/>"I think the act of moving towards a goal breaks down the barriers so the mind can assign care...once you care, role playing happens."<br/><br/>So...if removing XP from a fantasy game also removes the structure by which the player develops and progresses the character, I think Chris would say that you'll end up without naturally emergent roleplaying.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228975/#Comment_228975" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T11:14:41+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 11:14AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, that was a good post.

We play many indie games to use the engine of the mechanics to author something that affects the other players. But the result is, paradoxically, less affecting. Because for a story to be affecting it must be made from some of the author's bare personality and honest identity. When a player's character is a tool for affecting others, more than a membrane for two-way communication, play is "awesome" but boring. We appreciate the creativity and talents of our fellow players, but have no contact with their identities.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228996/#Comment_228996" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T12:15:36+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 12:15PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alternatively...mechanics focused authoring eclipsing character play is a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* happen to think its a VERY good thing...even to the point of going as far as saying an inherently superior thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMentioned here merely as a counterpoint to the current trend of suggesting that authoring focus is "missing" something essential that character focus somehow magically possesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I put this trend down to the normal attitude inherent in all "indie" endeavors of rejecting that which has been proven successful in favor of continually looking for the next thing to rail about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228999/#Comment_228999" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T12:35:19+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 12:35PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Paul, I think you're saying a thing that has some unexamined assumptions that are problematic at best.

The game is fantastic when evilness emerges from the player's use of the equations to express and resolve curiosity and self-absorption. But probably 85% of playtesters focus in on the equations and proceed to flog their way down the path to occult godhood they see in them, consciously and thinly authoring unsubtly evil characters.
