                    Share your most recent cool moment in actual play - no dumb war stories, just the freshest, latest  fun thing that happened at your table.  <br/><br/>Last night, <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> playtest:  Clinton's ethnic-Indian-but -hates-his-heritage officer gets cleverly set up on a date with the smokin' hot Indian-and-damn-proud-of-it Captain of the HMS Merlin.  He decides to "let her down gently" (prick), but his drunken commander, played by Remi, busts in and starts talking him up, telling her how great he is and what a fine catch he'd be.  She gets offended and leaves, and, in a pathetic effort to salvage his dignity, Clinton's guy follows and explains to her that he's secretly in love with his captain's (anglo) daughter - which Remi's character, of course, overhears. Complications fall like rain.                </div>

                            Did some arbitrary Pirate Nonsense for a recent playtest. In testing out our new wound system, one of my players shoved a parrot in the wound to staunch the bleeding.  Later in the fight, the parrot started flapping its wings.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure i'd call it cool, but it was funny as hell at the time and, oddly, it worked.<br/>

                            Sydney (as military-woman Weiss):  "Well, you see, passion is ... it's not that the military discounts passion.  But, rather, passion can be ... channelled.  Instead of just bursting out, it can be directed toward a goal.  And then you have the effect of both discipline and passion working together, so that passion can be directed into the same goals as discipline, rather than forcing you to pursue the goals of passion itself.  And that's good."<br/>

<p>The freshest and latest?</p>
<p>The Infected playtest.  While there were quite a few cool bits, I'm gonna go with the final act OverRun scene where the PCs were cornered in the TV station by the 8' tall, speaker-headed, <a href="http://www.keytarmusic.com/images/KeyWallAngle.JPG" rel="nofollow">keytar</a>-weilding zombies.  The day being saved by the infamous lunatic known only as Ringmaster (dressed as a circus ringmaster) who found the main power supply to the station, killing the music and thus the power of the zombies.</p>
<p>(edit) ... and killing himself by bridging the power connection as he tore it apart with his bare hands.</p>
<p>Rock on.</p>

                            Most recently? The last session of TSoY, where I generated and burned through 8 or 10 advances in a single session. But that game had enough on it to justify an actual AP post. Hopefully, I'll get around to that...<br/><br/>For individual moments, it was a couple of weeks ago playing <i>Falling Leaves</i>. Up until this moment, most of the consequences introduced were long-term and primarily social. At the final breath of William's scene, Michael and I could tell that he was strongly leaning towards one course of action. So Michael busts out with "If you do that, you will <i>lose your right arm in the battle!</i>" We stared at him in shock for several moments. Social ostracization, even losing your family, are all well and good. But your fucking right arm, right here, right now? That hit us hard.                        </div>

                            In a recent episode of Conspiracy of Shadows, I'm playing a priest who fancies himself a badass swashbuckler. Turns out he's way wrong. He's just a priest.<br/>
<br/>
There's these toughs sent by the sinister powers to run the characters out of town, and he's all brandishing a pair of flintlocks, saying "which one of you wants us to leave the most," acting all Erroll Flynn and stuff, and they end up just beating the CRAP out of him.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed the irony of it working out so non-cinematically.                        </div>

                            In the last session of our 1st Quest playtest we had a conflict that ended in one character, an abused little girl who beats up bullies and a little nerdy boy fighting because the boy ratted her out to her father and she got beaten with a belt.<br/>
<br/>
She made the boy eat dirt while she cried.<br/>
<br/>
It rocked.<br/>
<br/>
I love stakes where one of the sides is, "If I win, your character is forced to eat dirt by my character."<br/>

                            I ran <i>Dogs</i> for three of my ol' D&amp;D players. I asked them where they wanted to set the supernatural dials, and they said ALL THE FUCKING WAY UP. Cool. I was hoping that. I encouraged them to put some supernatural stuff in their Traits and gave examples like, "I exorcized a demon from my sister 2d10."<br/><br/>I was not prepared for Chris to create a character who was partially <span style="text-decoration: underline;">possessed</span> by a demon himself. His dude repeatedly branded the Tree of Life into his own arms because the pain helped him control the demon inside. He used the demon as inspiration and power to fight evil. Chris invented within the Dogs' Temple a secret society who all were "partially possessed" and in control of their inner demons. <br/><br/>His character's initiation had to do with coming to grips with his own possession. I started the scene with his roommate finding out about his special power and threatening to tell all his classmates and teachers. Chris decided that his roommate was possessed by a demon himself but was not in control of it. He ended up smashing his roommate's forehead with the Book of Life, leaving a Tree sign branded there, and coming to grips with his possession by rationalizing that it's okay, as long as you're in control. Being out of control like his roommate is bad.<br/><br/>And, as GM, who was I to judge?                        </div>

Chris (playing an Anchor) to Ion's self-absorbed, pouty, traumatized 14-year old pilot:<br/>
<br/>
"We don't know that we're all going to die.  We're going to live.  That's what we're fighting for.  And we can't do it without you."  (Chris can feel free to correct the dialouge, my recollection of it is fuzzy.)<br/>

I look across the table and see my friend Kate, grinning ear-to-ear, with her hand over her heart.<br/>

I played the Rat in a recent playtest of Cutthroat...and I won!  It helped that I knew the system better than anyone else, but still, it was cool to start out with the lowest stat and end up winning the game.<br/>
