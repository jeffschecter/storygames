That means I'm supposed to give him a threat die on his next turn.<br/><br/><b>Do I still give him that threat die next time, even if that threat was taken out?</b> (Also, the scene ended before he got his second turn, so does the threat die remain into the Interlude scene? Is the threat die tied to the threat?)<br/><br/>Another character managed to take out the last remaining threat on his turn. He rolled 3 danger on that turn.<br/><br/><b>So should I still have carried out the DANGER 3 results?</b><br/><br/>As it was, I ended the scene.

That was close!" and be done with it... I've found scenes that are "almost done" and that then cascade into a bunch of smaller threats right near the end are more frustrating for the players than exciting.  <br/><br/>I have had a "Mysterious Lurker!", with a countdown of "1" and some resistance, show up right at the end of a scene and then "get away" when not fully dealt with, which worked well... "Who was that Mysterious Lurker?!", but, generally, end the scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344570/#Comment_344570" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T16:38:26+00:00" title="September 30, 2011  4:38PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On useful thing you can do with "left over danger" (and this can even been done mid-scene) is to set up some "off board" threats that are not part of the current scene (and which the players can't yet interact with), but are foreshadowed for later. You can then pop threat dice on them that will be in play at the start when you bring them into a future scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
