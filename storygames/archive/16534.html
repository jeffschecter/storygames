This has been seen in<b> Kirlian photography</b> when a person is photographed with long hair and then rephotographed after the hair is cut. <br/><br/>When hair is cut, receiving and sending transmissions to and from the environment are greatly hampered. This results in numbing-out . <br/><br/><b>Cutting of hair is a contributing factor to unawareness of environmental distress in local ecosystems. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is also a contributing factor to insensitivity in relationships of all kinds.

We have to my knowledge approx 1-2 "native americans" 1 other "first people", and IIRC no Sikh. You're not going to get good answers here.<br/><br/>EDIT: Alternately, it might be the best place to ask: There are lots of white folks here with long or scruffy beards and long hair, we can ask them if they feel more sensitive in relationships and if they experience no sexual frustration...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378816/#Comment_378816" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-17T16:22:21+00:00" title="May 17, 2012  4:22PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed, that is exactly what it sounds like <i>to me,</i> but I wasn't asking if it is empirical fact, but whether it is cultural tradition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378819/#Comment_378819" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-17T17:16:00+00:00" title="May 17, 2012  5:16PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have at times worn my hair long, and at others cut it into a high and tight, with many variations in between, including both traditional and nontraditional "Mohawks". My experience is that hair determines how people see you, and at times how you see yourself, but it doesn't allow you to see the environment any better. Growing up on the Rez, I was teased by some of my friends at times for "looking like a hippie". My Native friends who have long hair (they are a minority) do it because they feel like it makes them look more traditional, or more Indian as it were. But I have never heard anything about the hair on your head making you a better hunter. In fact, the best hunters I know happen to be pretty clean cut and short haired. My long haired Native friends are almost all healers, both physicians and traditional healers. One is in fact a family practice physician as well as a Midewinini. I have known him with both short and long hair, but as he has become more traditional, he has stopped cutting his hair. I think it has to do with both his patients and himself seeing him as traditional and keeper of tradition. And we have had many conversations about tradition, but he has never talked about it helping him sense the environment. <br/><br/>This story sounds like a bunch of unfounded hippie bullshit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378833/#Comment_378833" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-17T19:37:54+00:00" title="May 17, 2012  7:37PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep.
