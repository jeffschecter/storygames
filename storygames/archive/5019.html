(I've had this a bit when trying out a new game, and there's often a well written opening bit describing the context but no one's read it yet.)<br/><br/>I'm not really good at just orating for a while in a good fashion, so I find it good to pass the opening text amongst the players and have them read aloud. It can sometimes be a good warmup and get people to absorb a little more than they would if I was just going on. This has worked alright.<br/><br/>One idea I haven't tested out yet was the idea of Exposition Keys (if you imagine these plugging into TSOY). Basically, a temporary key that a player gets for reading up on the exposition-dump on their own, and working its details out into the current session. So, use the character and her normal interactions as the means for explaining why the Xenomancer Wars were such a big deal back in the day, or whatever.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113098/#Comment_113098" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T06:55:34+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  6:55AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had to deal with this in <i>Grey Ranks.</i>  There's a base level of information that needs to get transmitted to everyone before each section of play.  My solution was to relate it directly to the events it commented on - in my case, it's a radio broadcast - and give no advice on who or how it is read, just stating that it needs to be read before play of that section begins.  In practice two things happen - either one person steps up and becomes "the voice of Radio Lightning", or the chore gets rotated around the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113099/#Comment_113099" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T07:52:01+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  7:52AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From my blog a year or so ago:<br/><br/>Exposition can be the most tedious part of an RPG, because the GM does all the talking. But it doesn't have to be that way. See below for how to improve this crucial part of RPGs.<br/><br/>Step 1: Plan<br/>Before the game, prepare small snippets of info for the players - the kind of stuff that gets listed in "adventure background" and then relayed by a "talking head" NPC. Usually this takes the form of about 3-5 cards with snippets of info on them (about as much as a well-filled Magic card).<br/><br/>Step 2: Deploy <br/>Give each player one of the above cards. The player reads the information, and decides if their character could know this. If it's inappropriate to their character, have them hand it to someone who they think has an appropriate character for the information. The players are trusted not to mix player and character knowledge, although if the conversation comes up or it seems relevant, the PC is of course free to mention the information. Now take the boring, talking-heads NPCs out of your game. The players will find out for themselves (do you really think they won't go looking for Lucius after the notes for Freeport, below?)<br/><br/>Step 3: Profit! <br/>This is a great way to remove boredom from the game, and keep players focused - they consider themselves custodians of the information, and it reduces the red herring effect. I find it makes my games feel much more organic - the players aren't always outsiders to the world and its events. <br/><br/>Death in Freeport Example: <br/>a. A timeline of the recent political history of Freeport, including the Drac family succession law, assassination of Anton Drac, and Milton Drac's financially ruinous plan for building the lighthouse. <br/>b. A description of a violent run-in with some of the orcish crewmen of The Bloody Vengeance in a sketchy tavern in another port some time ago. The character who gets this is described as "not quite winning" the fight, and having a vague ache in their shoulder. <br/>c. Description of Lucius, an old friend of one of the characters, who about a decade ago started acting very strangely, messed up his life as a temple scribe, then turned up five years later without knowing what had happened for that intervening period. The character wants to check in on his friend, see what he's up to. <br/>d. Scraps of academic information about an ancient civilization of snake-people. The book the information was in generally concluded that the snake empire did not exist. <br/>e. A few rough-and-tumble contacts at the docks in Freeport, and a mention about watching out for press gangs (or how decent thug-money can be made if willing to organize one).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113100/#Comment_113100" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T07:55:29+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  7:55AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2007 8:45AM by Graham.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If one has lots of exposition, I think it's worthwhile asking <i>why</i> there's so much, and whether it might be better to handle it another way: players make it up, it's explained through action, etc.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113101/#Comment_113101" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T08:02:15+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  8:02AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once, in Nobilis, I introduced an allied NPC who was the anthropomorphic personification of Exposition.<br/><br/>It was fun as players didn't mind infodumps from her, because, well, duh, that's what she was. And with her high Domain score, she could just create Exposition on any subject necessary, even if she didn't know anything about it beforehand, so they could always go to her if they needed information on pretty much anything.<br/><br/>Not many games let you do that, but it was very nice at the time.<br/><br/>In other cases, my current group uses our online lj-community to post situation/setting infodumps before the game begins. Most people are good at reading it, but there's often one or two people who don't, and they get a long-suffering sigh and then a quick cliff-notes version (or a printed handout if the expositor is prepared). An email list or even just catching people on IMs between sessions would probably work just as well, assuming everyone is moderately net-savvy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113102/#Comment_113102" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T08:07:35+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  8:07AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is one of those places where people forget that the form has advantages. They appeal to a literary model, a dramatic model or some kind of fantasy world business meeting model when really, since you're at a table about it and there are no strict time constraints you can just have a conversation about it. This is what I did with my Star Wars game, since a lot of stuff is very different than G-Canon (evil clones of Luke and Leia, clone troopers use a lot of recreational drugs, etc.). We just chatted about it, had a back and forth and then returned to wookiee grunts and whatnot.<br/><br/>Once these things stop being psychologically associated with somebody's authority or plot-cock or whatever the trend is, they're actually enjoyable to talk about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113105/#Comment_113105" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T08:25:33+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  8:25AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We use our group list like that as well - "here's a link to the wikipedia article about the battle of Shiloh, which you can consider a Strong Hint."

To the extent this can reinforce player images of their own and other characters, it's positive like "the cleric knows about the recent religious schism", "the rogue knows that the city guard are hunting after a serial killer", or a little humourous (so how does your character know about that very obscure penalty for adultery?).<br/><br/>I find sometimes players are also deliciously selective in what they then share and also put a "spin" on it.  You have to be prepared to let them do that without it sending things careening off down a bad direction, but it's an interesting use of "player authority" that I've seen traditional players who don't want any GM power be willing to take on easily.<br/><br/>If you have more exposition at-a-go than this, I think there's a problem as it's more info than you can probably expect players to take on and make use of in play, in the same session.<br/><br/>I can think of two immediate exceptions:<br/><br/>- "campaign kick off" information - for which campaign bibles are useful.  I prepare a campaign bible people are expected to read, and given an express 'cookie' for doing so in the form of earned dice rerolls for finding editing mistakes in it.<br/><br/>- exposition which is a reward, this is the explanation they have been fighting, searching, working, suffering for all through the past 6 sessions, in this case they want to hear it and espescially if they can in a format permitting something like what Malcolm talks about above where they can "discuss, query" as they are being told.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113168/#Comment_113168" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T16:32:48+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  4:32PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the recent game of With Great Power: The Night Watch that I ran (for three players who had never read the books or seen the movies), I did the following:<br/><br/>1) The bare essentials I broke down at first: The fact that there are Others, Light and Dark, magic etc. Also, that there is a Gloom that can be entered by all Others.<br/><br/>2) And from there, any time that I felt like it was time to drop a tidbit that explained how the setting worked, or whatever, instead of front-loading it all at the beginning, I'd drop it in a GM response.

People won't forget the detail next time...and everyone laughed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113351/#Comment_113351" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T12:28:40+00:00" title="December 10, 2007 12:28PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The group I game with doesn't give a ratsarse about continuity or contradictions. For example, it's not uncommon for NPC to go through as much as five name changes during a single story. We feel that if we can't be bothered to remember it then it probably wasn't that important in the first place. The strange thing is that we all make amatuer movies together and we have to be almost obsessive about continuity when we make them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
