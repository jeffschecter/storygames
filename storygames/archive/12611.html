Either the following is not explained clearly, or I just missed it.<br/><br/>When Pain dominates during a roll, the GM gets a coin of Despair. This is often referred to passively as "A coin is paid." One example, I believe, says that a player/character pays that coin. However, I can't find an explicit statement in the rules text (aside from play examples) that says the player pays the coin. Also, I can't find in the chargen section that players begin with coins, so what happens when Pain dominates on the first roll. Also, why in the materials section does the GM start with a handfull of coins if the coins come from the players.<br/><br/>So, my two questions (+ related questions) are:<br/><br/>Do players pay the coin of Despair when Pain dominates? Or do the coins come from "outside?"<br/><br/>What happens when players have no Hope coins to pay this cost? (Do they begin the game with coins?)<br/><br/>Can anyone clarify or point out the rules text I am too blind to see?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283294/#Comment_283294" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T09:38:57+00:00" title="July 28, 2010  9:38AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's bad language.

Perhaps better to say "A coin is earned" than to give it any particular provenance.<br/><br/>When a GM spends a coin of despair, it turns into a coin of hope, which exists in a common pool that the PCs get to draw from if they need to. The hope bank, as it were, starts play completely empty.<br/><br/>The materials section is a description of the supplies that the *table* needs. You'll need those coins once they start coming into existence. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/docholaday" title="docholaday"><img alt="docholaday" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/docholaday">docholaday</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283295/#Comment_283295" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T09:54:07+00:00" title="July 28, 2010  9:54AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2010 2:20PM by docholaday.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome.

Very Jim Jarmusch.<br/><br/>As Iago and Ryan say, the coins are spontaneously generated as needed, but as tactile reinforcement I have two bowls (red for despair, white for hope) and give each player 5 Japanese goyen coins (which are symbolic of luck), that they pay into the bowl of despair when pain dominates. I like the symbolism of the player paying the coin. If they run out I just give them more, but 1) I don't tell them that ahead of time, and 2) that very rarely happens.<br/><br/>Ryan uses a nice glass bowl for hope and tin cup for despair, but  I go for ease of transport and sturdiness so both my bowls are plastic. I also use 2 bowls to keep the black exhaustion dice and red madness dice handy.<br/><br/>The other tactile reinforcement I like is to use green and red poker chips for the Responses when madness dominates ("Green means go" for fleeing, "Red means blood" for fighting) and each player takes 3, in whatever mix they want.<br/>When madness dominates they hand me the appropriate color chip.<br/><br/>When they regain a response (because discipline dominates or they spend a coin of hope or they gain a die of permanent madness and reset to 3 responses) I let them choose either color, so over time they can change their mix of responses. That's a slight change from rules-as-written, but better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283419/#Comment_283419" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T21:27:47+00:00" title="July 28, 2010  9:27PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of notes on the coin economy.
