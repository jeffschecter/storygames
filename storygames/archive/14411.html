John is the GM.</p>\n<p>Humanity is love.  Pacting includes Summoning as the cost of admission, so Sorcery is a tiny bit more forgiving (because you only have to make 2 humanity loss rolls instead of 3).</p>\n<p><strong>The PCs</strong></p>\n<p>I'm Hibbukal, Exalt-Surgeon, inhumanly cerebral and deeply aristocratic.</p>\n<p>Pete is Sendric - Hibbukal's brother and patriarch of our House (Khanjar'a)</p>\n<p>Mike is Mosun - Sendric's primary human trading partner, ship captain, and secret lover of Hibbukal's daughter.</p>\n<p><strong>What we're up to</strong></p>\n<p>Mosun had been sort of tagging along for the last two sessions since his personal stressors were mostly resolved, but his Kicker wasn't.  We're in this transitional space where we're fighting through this awful jungle but we don't have many opportunities to show our love (since they're not with us).  Anyway, Mosun's been sitting in the highly stressful situation of having 1 Humanity.  Can't risk a summon, but can't gain the humanity back.</p>\n<p><strong>The Unconscious</strong></p>\n<p>Anyway, Mike and I had this great conversation before the game about the unconscious, and Mike used that as a launchpad for some really wicked roleplaying.  At one point an NPC - a potential source for love and humanity - propositioned him, and he described his hand slapping her before he thought about it.  It was perfect, because it was this really believable reaction of someone who's experiencing extremely traumatic stress and feels like someone's trying to play him.</p>\n<p>I unfortunately slipped up a bit, and went darker and more physical than I should have with the cerebral, removed Hibbukal.  The dark was fine, but the physical was a slip-up.  I hope the others will chalk it up to Hibbukal's stress after being badly mauled in the failed summoning.  So whereas Mike improved his play by thinking about his character's subconscious, I flubbed my play by forgetting to lock onto the fact that my character is more cerebral than I am.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I really thought Mike did an excellent job of bringing his character's pain back into the middle of the game.  But now that I'm sitting at 1 humanity too, I think we're really feeling the hurt.  Hard to get humanity back in a game about love when you're many miles away from the ones you love.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327675/#Comment_327675" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-03T13:44:32+00:00" title="June  3, 2011  1:44PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm!

I think that would be particularly appropriate when they're all starving and half-dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDITED: about the Meli's - there are at least two ways of doing that, though maybe it wouldn't suffice for your needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) Humanity Cap, as per Sorcerer &amp; Sword.  I can't recall the up-side to doing this, but the down-side is that your Humanity cannot raise above a certain threshhold.  So if your Meli is sitting at Humanity 3, his or her maximum, mechanically you don't have any incentive to be all lovey-dovey.  "Nah, I'm topped up on love right now, thanks though."  This also means it's potentially more common for them to hit 0 Humanity.<br/>\n<br/>\n(2) Alternately, dual humanity definitions from <i>Sex &amp; Sorcery</i>.  Like, say, Love &amp; Courage.  The Meli's <i>could</i> earn humanity through love, but it's not a big thing in their culture.  Instead, they're all into massive displays of courage (a/k/a Hubris) by which they sustain themselves mechanically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327690/#Comment_327690" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-03T14:47:17+00:00" title="June  3, 2011  2:47PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guess they'll have to hunt down some demons to Banish, eh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327693/#Comment_327693" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-03T15:11:08+00:00" title="June  3, 2011  3:11PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2011 3:54PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with James on his first point.<br><br>I think it's important for the Humanity definition to be applied with great elasticity.

Make sure to find ways to treat each other with love!<br><br>In my last two long <i>Sorcerer</i> stories, most of the game's Humanity revolved around how the PCs treated each other, though all of them had relationships with NPCs that were of equal importance to each PC.<br/><br/>In one, the PCs were convicts in a state penitentiary being torn apart in a sorcerous turf war. They didn't know each other at the start of play. But how they bonded against the threat of the penitentiary's soul destroying culture became some of the highlights of the game.<br/><br/>In the other game, they started as Mercs in the same company with a long history. And the threat to their bond became the fulcrum of play.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327724/#Comment_327724" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-03T19:39:37+00:00" title="June  3, 2011  7:39PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2011 7:44PM by Ry.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I dunno.

Otherwise, as you point out, the Humanity situation is... difficult. Wouldn't that help the situation? (I don't know, I'm asking!)<br/><br/>So, like, if you're doing the action hero fight through hordes of evil to get to the villain thing, how come there aren't starving orphans or forgiveable bad guys along the way? A Bad Guy certainly has "good people" doing his will, too, whether out of fear or coercion or simple misunderstanding. Those would all give the PCs interesting Love-related choices while climbing over dead bodies to get to the Evil One.<br/><br/>Edit: Or maybe this is an enjoyable tension in play, one you guys are grooving on?

This rating might rise or fall during play based on the actions of the Character. In each game, the GM defines what the definition of Humanity will be.<br/><br/>If you <i>do</i> things that are in alignment with the definition of Humanity, your Humanity might go up.<br/><br/>If you <i>do</i> things that are are against the definition of Humanity, your Humanity.<br/><br/>The key point is, what is at stake is what the Characters do... concrete actions. It isn't enough to be affected emotionally or have a reaction. What is at stake is how the Character actually behave within the context of the definition. So, if a man could either get the diamond he's spent years searching for, or save his brother's life....

How scripted is play?  Because that might be a bigger issue here.  In the players' situation, if I wanted to get some Humanity back, I would find some NPC's ASAP and love the holy hell out of them.  If that sabotages the quest, well: so be it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe story's about your guy's struggle to be a decent dude in the context of the quest, not the quest itself.  And if the high-Humanity guy says, "I'm doing my own thing," then that works too.  (Actually: Mr. Humanity could probably afford to summon some kind of demon to teleport the low-humanity guys back to some kind of town.  depending on how that's described in fiction, he might even earn a Humanity gain check from doing so.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328028/#Comment_328028" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T12:52:01+00:00" title="June  6, 2011 12:52PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cedric, to answer your question...<br><br>Humanity is the big behavioral regular in <i>Sorcerer</i>. It can go up or down for a character, and as long as it's above 0, your character is still "human."<br/><br/>But if it drops to 0, it means your character has slipped from the "tribe" of humans, as per the definition of Humanity. If Humanity is "Love" for example, the character has become incapable of love. If your character hits a Humanity of 0, the character is no longer capable of being a PC and the character sheet is handed over to the GM. This, losing the character through inhuman actions, is the threat that hangs over Players/Characters in <i>Sorcerer</i>, not death. What is at stake is how a character behaves and the choices he or she makes in relation to other people.<br/><br/>Humanity, then, if it drops to 0, can finish a character, and thus that character's story. However, most folks make sure to pump their Humanity back up if it starts dropping low. It's like a Vic Macky on THE SHEILD or Walter White on BREAKING BAD or almost any character on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA... they're all capable of doing horrible things, but then they do this one little, morally strong thing that redeems them <i>enough</i> and keeps them from wholly monstrous. <br/><br/><i>Sorcerer</i> stories end when a Kicker is resolved. A Kicker is a story beat written by each Player for his character that demands a choice of some kind. The Kicker is completely open-ended and without a planned resolution of any kind. Finding out how the Kicker is resolved --and who the character is by the time it is resolved -- is the largest unit of narrative in <i>Sorcerer</i> play.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
