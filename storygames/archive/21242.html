BTW:  I would recommend this podcast to everyone.   Anyway, great discussion about how ambiguity and unresolved questions are powerful aspects of art.  They discuss how interactive modes of storytelling are well suited to ambiguity (almost a direct quote of the guest on the podcast).  I feel this is so very true of storygames. It made me realize that one of the most engrossing things about the games I play happens when I reflect on the unresolved loose ends that inevitably occur in a story.  This might be happening during play, during a post game discussion, or even days later...  <br/>This realization has kinda crystallized my appreciation of the unresolved loose ends of storygames as an important aspect of their value and not just as a failure to tie everything up in a pretty little bow. <br/>Thoughts?  <br/>Cheers,<br/>Davey.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465413/#Comment_465413" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-09T19:57:56+00:00" title="August  9, 2017  7:57PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2017 8:06PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm definitely listening to this podcast, when I get a chance, and think this is a very ripe area for discussion. I wonder if they qualify what type of loose ends are vaulable? Are they valuable to the story itself, or valuable in other ways in-game in any way, or are they only valuable upon reflection or in other ways out-of-game? I have a playtest of one of my games tomorrow and have to finish up a document for that, because of this I won't be able to comment much today; however, any more specific details you could add, until I get an opportunity to listen to the podcast, would be super appreciated, Davey <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> We play and are interested in similar types games; I'm the organizer of Story Games SLC and we basically do what Story Games Seattle does with a few caveats; I've found the few comments you've made so far very relevant <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/>.

Loose ends are somewhat of a "spice", in my opinion - there's a very real danger of having too many of them, but a "perfect" story/dish can be bland and unsurprising.<br/><br/>I like the idea of exploring this in gaming.<br/><br/>Some examples:<br/><br/>Vincent Baker's <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> tends to work best when a Chapter resolves after a character's Interests are settled (seriously, it's in the rules, too!). This often leaves the others' stories unresolved, leaving lots of "loose ends" which can then be used to build future Chapters (which sometimes can even "backfill" elided bits of history).<br/><br/>My own <i>Land of Nodd</i> does this, too - the stories are full of strange coincidences, and, over time, this creates a bit of an illusion of a larger whole, beyond the grasp of the players.<br/><br/>Lots of films and novels use this to good effect, as well. To some extent leaving "loose ends" allows the player to take the role of audience and fill those "holes" with her imagination, making it greater than it might have been without them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465419/#Comment_465419" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-09T22:56:45+00:00" title="August  9, 2017 10:56PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2017 11:08PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When doing a one-shot, in which the full story is told in one sitting, I'm having trouble thinking of times when having loose ends is a preferable  aim. It might be fun to try to create a good story that had loose ends as a challenge <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/>. Perhaps when leaving the mystery is more interesting then narrating a specific outcome or when what the story was about has already been said. An example of the later could be something like us not knowing what happens to the villain at the end of No Country for Old Men\u2014the movie's message has already been made clear: that the world is an arbitrary and an absurd place and it's getting harder and harder to build your house on stone in it\u2014in other words, an uplifting film, haha <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/>. It seems that leaving loose ends in a one-shot story makes it much more difficult to craft a satisfactory one, and seems much more risky than aiming to tie up the loose ends.

For starters, it's not terribly challenging! <br/><br/>No... we generally want to strive for reincorporation, logic, and consistency. However, sometimes being willing to accept loose ends can make for a better story: perhaps the writers of No Country for Old Men wanted to write a conclusive ending for the villain, but someone was able to say, "No, it's OK. I think it will work nicely if we don't resolve this, because of X, Y, and Z" (e.g. that the movie's message has already been made clear, or whatever other reason).<br/><br/>The temptation of tying up all loose ends can definitely ruin a good story sometimes, if the only apparent way to tie up the loose ends is sub-par, predictable, or boring. I've played a lot of games where this was the case: someone was able to say, "Hey, no, let it go... let's just leave it at that", and that was very much the right decision to make.<br/><br/>I'd imagine that if we found a way to quantify "loose ends" versus "tied-up ends", we'd notice that the ratio of tied-up ends to loose ends in our favourite stories approaches the Golden Ratio or some other such mathematical equilibrium. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hyades" title="hyades"><img alt="hyades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/458/nC00J8GI62UXP.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hyades">hyades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465741/#Comment_465741" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-18T12:04:28+00:00" title="August 18, 2017 12:04PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As to ambiguity, Greg Stolze made great use of unreliable narrators in his Delta Green scenario <i>The Star Chamber</i> - it's basically the movie Rashomon in the format of a tightly structured traditional rpg scenario.<br/><br/>I wonder if there are any indie rpgs that explicitly go for unreliable narrators?<br/><br/>Loose ends come up a lot in Remember Tomorrow, too. When the final exit happens and an episode ends there will usually be some unresolved story arcs. I guess the risk at that point is that you might not have enough story or characterization yet to justify even a loose end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465767/#Comment_465767" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-19T02:44:29+00:00" title="August 19, 2017  2:44AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Loose ends" + "psychology of awe" makes me think of all those novels and movies and shows and comics where the audience is treated to mere snippets of this larger imagined universe.  The best example I can think of is Cerebus, whose internal causality is often familiar and mundane... except when it really, really isn't.  Apparently there is real magic in the world of Cerebus?  But no one who we get to know is really on top of it?  And the main characters get caught up by it every once in a while?  And the only explanations we ever get sound like they're coming from an alien?  If these were one-offs they might seem random, but as part of this ongoing tapestry... yeah, they inspire some serious awe.<br/><br/>So, the clearest parallel I can think of is the GM who writes their own cosmology but then only reveals the bits of it that the characters interact with.<br/><br/>I sometimes manage to get moments like that in my game <i>Delve</i>.  It's not a game about providing the experience of awe, but it is a game of awesome hidden truths, and every once in a while the players bump into those in just the right way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465776/#Comment_465776" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-19T08:10:42+00:00" title="August 19, 2017  8:10AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2017 8:13AM by Rickard.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A good story, in my book, lingers after the session is done and makes the players think. I don't think loose ends are as important as good "what ifs", as the main thread of the story should be solved to make the players satisfied (even if they loose). What lead up to the climax and could the results had been different if the players taken other actions? Did the players choose the right path? That's good what ifs.<br/><br/>Loose ends are bound to happen - a minor antagonist gets away, or some people's agendas didn't come into play - and I think that's good in form of tying stand-alone adventures together to form a coherent campaign. That's how I made campaigns anyway, when I was a more traditional game master.<br/><br/>But building "end games" that are purely loose ends?

Not only is it impossible to fully detail every possible connection in the world, but you actually don't <i>want</i> to, because it is always good to have loose ends you can tie hooks to later on.<br/><br/>This is a tactic of episodic/serial TV writing as well (who was the shadowy person that destroyed the evidence in episode 4?  Maybe we'll find out by episode 13!)  Episodes of <i>The X-Files,</i> <i>Rick and Morty</i> or <i>Twin Peaks,</i> as well as the typical soap opera or telenovella, for instance, often leave massive loose ends lying around purposely so the writers can come back later and have something to work with.<br/><br/>Cliff-hangers are often massive loose ends themselves: in their dash to produce a thrilling chair-gripping climax at the end of a season, writers will often go all out and put their protagonists in positions they have <i>NO IDEA</i> how they'll get out of.  Then they go home and pace the floor for 90 days figuring out how to do it!  <i>(Rick Sanchez in Galactic Prison, anyone?)</i><br/><br/>I've found the same thing is true of campaign play and episodic/serial play.  It's just really useful to have a loose end lying around when you need to circle something back.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti" title="lorenzogatti"><img alt="lorenzogatti" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti">lorenzogatti</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465788/#Comment_465788" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-19T17:16:17+00:00" title="August 19, 2017  5:16PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Deliberately leaving loose ends is a pacing tool: unresolved plot threads are a significant component of suspense, audience interest, plot continuity, and other good things; their <i>quantity</i> should be controlled and (usually) remain roughly constant, balancing confusion and boredom.<br/><br/>There's a great example of loose end maintenance and escalation in China Mi\xe9ville's <i>The City and the City</i>: at the beginning the first person narrator is clearly placed in an imaginary European city by simple means like an invented language and invented place names; then we start seeing perplexing jargon and objects that, going beyond the invented language, suggest there's something peculiar about the city and its people; then we see even more instances of the city's strange features, with physical descriptions that clarify what most of the jargon means but stress that the city's peculiarity is a very big deal; then a sudden page and a half of explanation about the history of the city provides some partial answers (enough to understand in general terms what's going on but not how or why) and opens a new phase that focuses on the weird political and moral side of the city's special feature.

I\xb4ve been just an observer for too long,but not anymore! I think i can add some value here.<br/><br/>So, first, a warning: Ill talk about the loose ends in game design. Of course there are loose ends in the fiction, and, for me, that's natural in all kind of tabletop RPGs.  I agree with the exposed in this topic about the loose ends being one of the most important aspects of a long-term campaign.<br/><br/>Let's focus on the other side: The concept of loose ends in game design<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>When we create a game, we are developing an experience. We are encapsulating the experience with a way to approach it. For me, this is the most important concept about a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>Where does the loose threads fit in there? <b><i>They are a way to generate some sort of content that adapts the table. <br/></i></b><br/>For me, it's the logical result of all the discussion about, mostly but not only, social contract in tabletop RPGs. It's also a logical result of all the forgie discussion about story-now games.  But let's focus on the former. <br/><br/>Social contract is the only way to ensure all the gaming table is engaged with the game (the way we play, the pace, the things we should expect, including genre etc..)<br/><br/>The loose ends has real value, adapting the game for the participants of the table.<br/><br/>A loose end is a hole carefully designed to add value. It requires mastery and a purpose. Not every loose end is a good loose end. Loose ends are surrounded by inspiring, imaginative words or phrases that makes you work with something. You never start from zero: All content you create is built from the surrounding content.<br/><br/><b><i>A loose end is a non-written prompt</i></b>, like the prompts, the loaded questions the MC makes for their players to answer. A prompt built for her (The MC) to answer. She can show this "hole" to the players and fill it together, or expose her point of view about it and agree with the other participants the way to handle this. <br/><br/>When carefully designed, it can be liberating and result in multiple ways of approaching a game. <br/><br/>OOT: Sorry for my english, im spanish native, trying my best!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465858/#Comment_465858" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-23T13:47:03+00:00" title="August 23, 2017  1:47PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2017 1:47PM by AsIf.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Edgargso">@Edgargso</a> -- I agree that the two things are related, in that both are prompts for creativity, but I would suggest that you're referring more to "fruitful voids".  <br/><br/>The difference being that a "loose end" (as I see it) is something that resides on the <i>character/plot</i> level, whereas a fruitful void can be left anywhere in the gameworld's structure.  In fact the whole world can be fruitful void, or just certain portions/regions/aspects of it.<br/><br/>As I was using it (haven't listened to the podcast), a "loose end" would be a unresolved question regarding something that happened in the gameworld, that is left deliberately unexplained (and maybe not even known) by the GM.  The creative part happens later, when you create something and tie it to a loose end, or pick up two loose ends and tie them together (that's especially satisfying!)<br/><br/><i>YES I PLANNED IT THAT WAY ALL ALONG; I AM A GENIUS!</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465868/#Comment_465868" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-24T01:52:32+00:00" title="August 24, 2017  1:52AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/paganini">@paganini</a> Land of Nodd's reincorporation system is simple: after a scene in one character's storyline, write down an object or phenomenon you'd like to see more of.

On the other hand, more elements means more possibility of an overlap that's too diffuse -- 5 maybe-sorta mysteries instead of 1 or 2 proper mysteries.<br/><br/>My personal favorite moments of "some unknown larger thing" in these games have generally come about from a GM trying to pursue and partially answer questions already raised, just not to the point of finality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465869/#Comment_465869" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-24T01:57:10+00:00" title="August 24, 2017  1:57AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2017 2:01AM by David_Berg.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Edgargso">@Edgargso</a> I like the points you made!

Thank you!  Fruitful voids, reincorporation, loose ends as prompts, value in campaigns vs one shots.  I'm sure I have spaced on some of the good ideas since I looked a week or so ago, then just now and too briefly.   I believe however that Every comment here has real value.  <br/>Yesterday I played a game of "follow" with multiple loose ends. I introduced some. As yogi bara apocryphaly quipped "in theory, there's no difference between theory and practice, in practice there is".  I felt like some of the loose ends served to create a feeling of expansiveness to the world and story we made. There were things that happened that went unexplained... what happened to Gunnar after he disappeared into the wilds?  What happened to Dr Malicott's daughter when she "ran away".  These were fruitful voids.  Other aspects of the game were more like dead ends than loose ends. They didn't impact our fun much, but they didn't serve to give our world the characteristic of transcending the limits of the story we told either.  Things were thrown up that never got reincorporated. What were those purple flashes anyway?  For one reason or another we never pursued that.  What was up w the asexual guy in extremely padded clothing. People have ideas that don't get fully articulated.  As someone above noted, these might have had a roll later in a campaign. This was a one shot.  Other seemingly loose ends got reincorporated when it turned out that the disease vector gnats were actually avian spores of the giant birds that may have been the main food source of another colony we had moved in on...  but what about that other colony... what and who they were was never much explored. <br/>My recent experience demonstrates the validity of the comments people made in this string.   Loose ends are of more than one kind. <br/>Thanks again. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465914/#Comment_465914" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-26T04:58:43+00:00" title="August 26, 2017  4:58AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ric:  off topic but... an experimental composition idea I've had seems related to your excellent Brian eno story:  every player receives a track.

Before I began playing/writing story games I studied music composition and wrote many pieces of this type - not specifically using the idea you mention, but creating music with an ensemble by means of verbal instructions rather than sets of musical figures.<br/><br/>The experience is very similar in the writing and creation of pieces like this and the writing and playing of story games.  It's just using a different language and grammar, and the nice thing about playing story games is there isn't as much frustration around not having an audience to play for since the games are more intended to be enjoyed by the group playing than for spectators to view.  Many of the ensemble performances would have been more enjoyable if we played them with the purpose of entertaining/enriching each other rather than hoping for approval from the audience.<br/><br/>It would be interesting to see if any of the experimental techniques for musical composition of this type could transfer into story games - graphical notation, recording and manipulation, sampling, etc.  Maybe there's a whole new thread to explore here...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465970/#Comment_465970" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-28T23:31:11+00:00" title="August 28, 2017 11:31PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!
