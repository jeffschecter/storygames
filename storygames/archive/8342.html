It would be kind of cool to have a talk about a game where you're discussing the game and find that each of you discovered very different truths about the same political entities and groups.<br/><br/>I think this idea has an appeal to my way of thinking.  Now, a twist I just thought of is - what if you could join another game in process at another group with the character who came from another game in progress.  Two worlds that started from a single starting point that went in differing directions and are now joined by some sort of probabilistic travel.<br/><br/>This would make a cool campaign idea (or even a cool game idea) where characters can move from world to world (all having the same starting point), but moving at different time flows (some groups play more often than others, some groups blue book great deals of time, etc) and with very different results.  Even the mixing of the travelers would create wrinkles and motes.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184350/#Comment_184350" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T19:39:05+00:00" title="December 19, 2008  7:39PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought of something like this, too, only it was for different groups to start play with the same IAWA oracles.

There's a seed for a truly epic campaign of time and reality travel here. Which is, by the way, often an awful premise. Still, this one might not only work but be really nifty as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184580/#Comment_184580" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-22T07:15:55+00:00" title="December 22, 2008  7:15AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is neat that you mention this.

The fun part was when they started laying traps for each other and sending charmed monsters at each other.  The one I remember best was one of those classic puzzle rooms...solve the riddle that tells you what order to pull the levers...the first party through solved it...then used a Stone to Mud spell to destroy the clue carved in the wall...heh...the next party made the room...had no idea...randomly pulled some levers...2 party members got gacked before they managed to escape.  <br/><br/>I had to do a bit of GM trickery to keep them from encountering each other until finally I called one session early, and then invited everyone together for the big reveal.  They totally attacked each other...beat the snot out of each other...I attacked them with a bunch of minotaurs and such...the survivors united against that and then went on to get the artifact together...those that were left.  I think 4 characters out of the 12 made it out of the dungeon alive...<br/><br/>Good times...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184637/#Comment_184637" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-22T16:34:51+00:00" title="December 22, 2008  4:34PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Good times...</blockquote>\nThis sounds fun, and it reminds me of the infamous "Head of Vecna" incident.<br/><br/>==<br/><br/>The think about my original post though would be that the groups wouldn't participate in each other's journey unless they did it at the same table.  After some time, the two realities would take on a tone and feel that was unique to that group at that time and crossing over from one group to another would let the players know just how unique their table play is to others'.<br/><br/>Each would have a differenet nuance, a different emphasis, and a different take of each setting bit.  The Guild of Cutpurses in one game is a noble group of urchins with a slightly tarnished heart of gold, while in another, that same group is a dark and sinister force that disappears their enemies in alleyways.  They are both lead by the "Dark Ratling", but that figure is vastly different in each - even if he is identical in stats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185120/#Comment_185120" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-28T21:55:35+00:00" title="December 28, 2008  9:55PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a lot of ways, Amber Diceless was a lot like this.
