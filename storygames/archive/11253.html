Recently, I came up with an idea that I think might be really cool to try out.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould a sort of "campaign" be played with Penny?  I'm imagining something like a large disaster of some sort took place.  The precise nature of the disaster might not be decided beforehand.  Over the course of one sitting, the players learn about the present characters as well as about the disaster/other event that happened to each of them.  On subsequent sittings, the same characters could come back, recovering new memories (they may or may not have remembered their previous ones), or new characters could sit in.  Over time, the nature of the disaster, the likely conspiracies behind it, and interrelations between the characters could all be explored.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine as a possibility one sitting where a man talks about his wonderful happy marriage to his wife.  The next sitting, a different player plays a woman who describes how horrible her life was.  In the last memory, we realize that she is the previous character's wife.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this has cool possibilities for world-building and continued narration with the same power that core Penny has for character creation and short-form fiction making.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you guys think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250011/#Comment_250011" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T20:25:37+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  8:25PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's definitely possible.

Infection leads to memory loss, but restoring the memory could give intelligence to help the conflict.  <br/><br/>At least a crazy random idea.  I agree completely that a Penny campaign would be intriguing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289837/#Comment_289837" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T09:55:06+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  9:55AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.<br/><br/>I think a way to link them together would be through hacking the Memory Triggers. Since you make five per player but only use three, there's room for something there. I would try: at the end of the session, before answering "do you want to remember?" take two more slips of paper. Write down a Memory Trigger on each inspired by your own recollections. Gather those new ones and the three you used before together, and put them in a new bowl for the next group of patients.<br/><br/>Also, consider what it means to choose to remember or not remember. Just because I choose to forget again doesn't mean I'm not a patient next week. After all, there aren't enough volunteer amnesiacs for the Orphic Institute to just stop using one because he or she had a bad life.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
