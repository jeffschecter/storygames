Maybe it's the sprawling generic fantasy continent or maybe it's 1903 but with robots.  Something broad, easy to understand, and flexible enough to make a little corner of it your own.  Probably fantasy, but hopefully interesting and unique shared fantasy.<br/><br/>We get Tony Dowler to make a map.  We get somebody to set up a Web-based depository with a blog for news/AP reports, a place to dump files, and maybe a wiki.  Custom Abulafia generators.  Whatever makes sense.  <br/><br/>Then we carve out territory.  The idea would be to use it as a mutual playground, sort of like a system-less RPGA thing (that sounds horrible but you get the idea).  People and game groups could come and go.<br/><br/>So here in NC, my friends and I grab a chunk of land and rock out using the Solar System.  Somebody in Denmark hacks AGON and plays that in another corner.  There's some D&amp;D4 action on the virtual tabletop and Harper's running Savage Worlds out west.  Jonathan Walton does something unsettling with his SG Boston peeps.  And when I visit Boston, I can bring a dude with a shared history to play in another part of the world.  I'll have to stat him for JWalt's weirdo home brew system, but we both know the world and its highs and lows.  The game he runs is informed by events in my game.  The crazy villain who shows up in my AP report becomes a shared object world-wide.  When we cross boundaries or reincorporate, we can ping the original author and coordinate.  <br/><br/>I know this isn't remotely ground-breaking, but it seems like it could be really fun.

Here are some more precious thoughts!<br/><br/>There's definitely a "too many cooks" issue and I'd like to cogitate on how to address that.  I know if you have a hand in things, Snyder, there will be sex-unicorns, and I can't get behind that.  There are many individual tastes and whatever "campaign setting" we come up with needs to accommodate a broad swath.  But not too broad.  So we should talk about how large collaborative projects can work, how consensus is achieved, what an optimum number of creators is (if any), that sort of thing.  I don't have any answers, but I think "it's wide open!  Do whatever you want!" will fail after being dumb for a while.<br/><br/>Graham, I don't see why not.  Really focused games might be problematic (can I just drop my Savage Worlds necromancer into Poison'd?) but there's no reason your scurvy ship couldn't pay a visit to various ports of call, play out an insular and horrible drama, and influence the overall fiction.  <br/><br/>I think "use whatever system you want" should be a baseline.  That's an interesting experiment; cross-pollination will be fascinating, and I, personally, would not get on board if you made me play a specific game. At least I wouldn't be very active.  One thing I imagine are setting ports, documents people whip up based on the agreed background, so you can slot in world-specific Keys in TSOY, Aspects for Spirit of the Big Campaign, and suitable color for 1001 Nights.  This body of information would grow over time and make participation easier.  Of course the shared fiction would also grow, so that would make participation a little harder if you cared about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172287/#Comment_172287" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T08:09:21+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  8:09AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ryan, <br/><br/>What did you learn?

So like, if I'm playing Polaris, talking about the fall of a great civilization that once dwelt at the south pole of this planet, I should still include, like, "puzzle boxes, telescopes, and astrology."  And then, when Adam Flynn runs SOTC in the ruins of my dead civilization, his crew can discover the secret star-watching telescopes with which the fallen kingdom unwrapped the Cthulhoid puzzle box of the cosmos' Mistaken.<br/><br/>Also, I would suggest that planning too much out in advance is folly.  It should happen like this: somebody plays a game in the setting and posts a play report.  Then, other people, inspired by that play report, play games and post their play reports, and the world gradually takes shape in that fashion.  This way, stuff doesn't exist until it appears in someone's play session.  People can post maps and other stuff in addition to play reports, of course.  But I think trying to create a setting and then play in it is not nearly as cool as collaboratively creating a setting over time through our collective play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172293/#Comment_172293" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T08:29:03+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  8:29AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yes, this whole thing should be predicated on play.

One piece of art illustrating the coolest thing about the region (encouraging author/artist collaboration I'd hope)<br/>2.  Five general themes or pillars of setting.  These are things you'll expect to turn up in pretty much every session played in the region.  Pillars should reflect themes obliquely while also standing on their own, and have no other restrictions.  At least one of each.  You can spend 200 words on each entry if you want.  <br/><br/>All entries are anonymized and get put to popular vote, so hopefully there will be some initial enthusiasm.  Once the five (or four or whatever) are chosen, the authors get together and blend them a tiny bit as appropriate.  <br/><br/>If we did this, the initial five-region world would consist of exactly 25 things, with no place owning more than five.

Nobody wants to step on each others toes so if anything comes of it it's very weaksauce and disjointed - like bad freeform roleplaying.<br/><br/>I was trying to avoid that problem, so I added a bunch of stuff, and I had a vision for the project and a <a href="http://www.greathundred.org/The_Great_Hundred:Ideal_Entries" rel="nofollow">style guide</a> right out of the gate.  Mike Holmes pointed out some really, really good points and I made that style guide even tighter.  Some people were put off by that, but I carried on.  Others were not sure how to do it the "right way" so I made <a href="http://www.greathundred.org/Halcyon_Sea" rel="nofollow">some</a> <a href="http://www.greathundred.org/Akavars" rel="nofollow">examples</a>.<br/><br/>I attracted really <a href="http://www.greathundred.org/Funeral_of_Cobra_Par" rel="nofollow">awesome</a> <a href="http://www.greathundred.org/Message_in_a_Bottle" rel="nofollow">stuff</a> from the few people who grokked the Great Hundred, but couldn't hit critical mass because this awesomeness became a barrier to entry.  Also, since the pages were hard enough to write, the pattern was "write a couple of pages, make a couple of comments, and come back later to see how the project is doing."<br/><br/>Now this wasn't a complete failure, but it meant that for the project to continue I needed to constantly advocate for it (to both existing and current contributors).  More importantly, I could get more <i>contributors</i> but not more <b>advocates</b>.  That's a tale of too much frontloading.<br/><br/>However, MOST collective worldbuilding projects (I've seen many) die by catapulting from too little to too much.  There's too little, someone tries to be a leader and jumpstart the project by just putting stuff out there, and it's a turnoff or it's suddenly too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172321/#Comment_172321" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T09:16:57+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  9:16AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was talking to Matt Wilson about doing this with our 4E game and John Harper's 4E game.

The answer comes from fanfic.  There are two possibilities:<br/><br/>1. Diligently and carefully look at themes and elements and see where they mesh and conflict. Identify which conflicts have narrative juice and discard the rest. Pump up the areas where they mesh even if they are minor and not very important. (Did you know that Lurch once leaned out of a window Batman was climbing past? Well, figure out why he was in Gotham City and now you've got a real story!)<br/><br/>2.

I've wanted to work on something like this for a long time. I'll draw maps all day long and then I'll get up out of bed and draw some more.

To keep it consistent.<br/><br/>Then he has his "Feudal Lords", beings who have a very broad and loosely defined authority, but who can order and organize things in their territories. And (this is the interesting part) they too have the power to divide and grant parts of their territories to others.<br/><br/>So we have this small "Landlords" with some powers on their own. They have a lot of freedom and interactions, and are pretty much able to do as they please. But in the end they still have someone to answer to. And if things are not working (or that someone is unavailable) they can escalate and go to the "King".<br/><br/>Note that this might seem like a common business hierarchy at first look. It is not. The feudal metaphor is precisely to stress how subjective, flexible and non-committing those charges are.<br/><br/>Now, the thing is that the "Feudal Kingdom" doesn't need to be (exclusively) the "physical world". You could get a "feudal lord" about religion and myths, one about politics among the kingdoms, one for multi-regional societies... You get my drift.<br/><br/>The thing is that people are actually working under a "mercenary banner". That is, I can work with anyone I feel like. I want to include some religious stuff about the world in my campaign/land/group/city/whatever? Then I simply announce it to the corresponding feudal. He can't forbid me from doing so (unless it completely breaks the spirit of the Campaign, as defined by those pillars people were talking about), but he can advise me about it, and he'll be the common source of knowledge (and organization) about that particular field.<br/><br/>I am also thinking this can be adapted to be a rotating work. That is, after a while I can decide whether I want to resume my work as a lord to my domain, or change it to something else (with my King's approval, by the way). Even the King's post could be a rotating (and willing) one. Or even a meta-democracy of sorts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172376/#Comment_172376" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T11:50:58+00:00" title="October  1, 2008 11:50AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The fanfic model seems like a good one.

A succinct list of things that defines each of, say, five regions to provide some local color and cohesion. These are decided by some contest and a popular vote, with an eye toward both consensus and building enthusiasm.<br/>4.  The whole thing is loose and easy to administer.  We run it like a gigantic story game itself, with high expectations for listening, agreement, cooperation, a sense of thoughtful fun, and so forth.  <br/><br/>But this is still pretty flexible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172393/#Comment_172393" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T12:53:52+00:00" title="October  1, 2008 12:53PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might participate in something like this, assuming it had a low barrier to entry, no authority structure and focus on real play, as opposed to world-building (which is a fine hobby, but not my thing when considered in isolation).<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I favor Jonathan's approach of just starting to play, rather than over-systemizing everything. I fail to see how there would be need for more structure than just the notion that the respective backstory-authorities of these individual groups make an effort to synchronize their settings. That strive for synchronization already allows us to crib good ideas from actual play reports of others, suggest things for others to play with in their groups and so on. I'm not seeing what else could be required, except for some simple database interface to input and catalogue information. A wiki or something of the sort.<br/><br/>Also, for a concrete genre suggestion, I'll put in a vote for a sword &amp; sorcery setting in the Howard/Leiber vein, with a restrained magic level.

However, an abbreviated version of the game, requiring only 8 entries per player, broken down as a telephone pad (one entry per player for a-b-c, then one for d-e-f, et cetera). Should take a little more than two weeks.  Play on a wiki.<br/><br/>Everyone write an encyclopedia entry, one due every 2 or 3 days. Roughly 500 words. Maximum: as much as you want. <br/><br/>1. On the first turn, each player writes either an 'A', 'B', or 'C' entry, from the point of view of an amateur, armchair historian within the setting itself (feel free to develop the personality of said scholar) . The entry should be roughly 500 words minimum, and within it you embed two citations to an entry that hasn't been written yet. At the end of the entry, you sign your name, and list the two links to other "phantom" citations -- their names exist, but their content will get filled in only on the appropriate turn. No letter-group can have more entries than the number of players, either, so all citations made on the first turn have to start with non-A, B, or C letters.<br/><br/>2. On the second turn, you write another entry. However:<br/>          * Your entry must 'fill in' one of the phantom entries someone else already made.<br/>          * You need to make THREE citations at the end. One must be a reference back to an already-written entry, and two must create unwritten entries that don't already exist. ((It's fine to also link to other phantom entries that someone else already made, but only as a 'bonus'.)) These links should be to things that in some way intersect the entry you just wrote. <br/><br/>3. It's a sin to link only to your own work -- you can link back to an entry you've written, but only if you've ALREADY back-linked to someone else's entry, so that the link to your entry is a 'bonus'. (This forces everyone to intertwingle their entries, so that everybody depends on -- and is reading -- everyone else's stuff.)<br/>          * Again: no fair writing the entry for a phantom citation that YOU created in the first place, unless there's NO other alternative. <br/><br/>4. On the fourth (of eight) turns, you still make three citations, but unlike previous turns, TWO must be a reference back to already-written entries, and ONE must create a new phantom citation to be written.<br/><br/>5. On the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth turns, you make two or more back-links, but unlike previous turns, ALL must be a reference to already-written entries or already-created-phantoms, because by this point you have enough phantom entries to carry through to the end.<br/><br/>6. Despite the fact that your peers are self-important, narrow-minded dunderheads, they are honest scholars. No matter how strained their interpretations are, their FACTS are accurate as historical research can make them. So if you cite an entry, you have to treat its factual content as true.

I think that interaction has to be "more imporant." Otherwise, it falls into the camp of "world building." <br/><br/>My notion of the different eras widened up the types of games to play. Maybe more pulpy SotC play happens in a steampunk fantasy than in Snyderstan, Refuge of the Sex Unicorn. <br/><br/>But, I think your point is a major consideration.

How much will any given player have to read of online play reports and background information in order to successfully participate?  Many of the games we're talking about here require a lot more player input than your average D&amp;D campaign and/or are GMless or group-GMed.  Sure, I might be invested in this enough to read all the play reports and generated fluff, but is that true of all the folks I'm going to be playing with?  That's why I keep leaning towards a more minimalist structure.  The less you require of participants, the more likely that it can be sustained.<br/><br/>A lot of the things you're talking about (different eras, etc.) could be really excellent as emergent properties that arise because of the interests of people involved or the interesting interactions of games and setting.  Like, if there's a lot of Medical Hospital playtesting that happens in relation to this, the variety of diseases and ailments that can vex you in the world might be meticulously defined, while we know next to nothing about the political system of the kingdom.  That seems natural and completely okay to me.  The opposite -- generating a lot of information that people feel required to know but ends up not being useful in play -- seems more of a problem.  It only matters if there's a post-apocalyptic age of the world <i>if a group wants to play a game there</i>.<br/><br/>EDIT: Basically, I worry a lot about "playing before we play," in regards to generating setting stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172430/#Comment_172430" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T14:17:40+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  2:17PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When we step to the working phase, I'd like to see a statement of goal.

I know I won't spend much time caring about bits 1-4 if my game is set in 5, so that's 80% of the problem gone in the short term.  We'll want to make sure the five regions are distinct and compelling to different crowds, so people latch on in roughly equal numbers.  Setting your game on the border between 1 and 2 still reduces the information you need to care about by 60%.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pedyo" title="pedyo"><img alt="pedyo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pedyo">pedyo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172530/#Comment_172530" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T04:40:20+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  4:40AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the idea and would try to find a group to take part in the actual play!<br/>/Peter                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172536/#Comment_172536" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T04:54:27+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  4:54AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Hey all, I think the way to proceed at this point is to step back and process all these ideas and desires, which is what I'm going to do.

"Oracle" is essentially shorthand for "short, punchy, open-ended description with seeds for action--3 sentences maximum". Add three examples of good oracles and bad oracles on top of that and you're ready to go.

They had a certain amount of money to build facilities, hire research scientists, and get security going. They could also turn it to cert cred at a 10-1 ratio to pay PC's for runs on an enemy's facilities. It worked like this:<br/><br/>Morgan is a GM who sends a mission to Ross' PC's. Ross then runs his security as his PC's try to break in and steal/extract his data/personnel. <br/><br/>Anyway, that system sucked. But a system that worked, that would be cool.<br/><br/><br/>This thought is over here now:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14785" rel="nofollow">Multi-Group Games&lt;/a</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336279/#Comment_336279" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-28T13:31:14+00:00" title="July 28, 2011  1:31PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14723&amp;page=1#Item_20" rel="nofollow">Chain World</a> and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7769" rel="nofollow">Big Campaign</a> popping up at the same time?

So, I'm interested.<br><br>I think that an implementation of TBC that would be neat is if we started playing games.  Each game is a node on the TBC map.  And every game that enters TBC (which can be any game?) is adjacent to at least one previously written-up node.  I'm not sure how much more needs to be defined.  Like what does adjacent mean?  I figure that depends on the instance.  Sometimes it's maybe a historical connection and sometimes geographic and maybe it could be only philosophical or something -- but they should be ways that the two games/settings bleed together.

Slobbovia was a diplomacy variant published in a zine in the 70's and 80's that focused more on the story and characterization than game mechanics.  Particularly since each group will have their own mechanics, we'll be spending most of our time on story and characterization.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the original suggestion was to create a map first, but I think it would be better if each person had a square section of the world that they fleshed out on their own. Other people involved can use anyone's square, but aren't allowed to make changes to it without approval.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to make the map work, I think we should use <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Geomorphs" rel="nofollow">Geomorphs</a>.  Let's say the world starts out as a 4 by 4 square grid (giving us 16 squares total).  Each square inside would have at most 4 sides that are shared.  These sides would be divided up by 2 (making 8 total shared sections), and the person working on the square would chose different types of geography, like water, tundra, mountain, grassland, etc for each shared side section.  Anyone chosing an adjacent square would have to make sure the border that they shared matched their neighbors.  As we get more people involved in the shared world, we can add more sections.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll we would really need is a wiki that people where people would add actual play and other information about their sections and a map that someone would manage as new people created sections of the world.  I would recommend that people only be allowed to have one section to work on, at least at first.  In would be fun to have a blog/newsletter where people could post news from the Big Campaign, but that might be something further down the road as the Big Campaign begins to grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I think we would need to agree is the time period/technology level, but even that could vary throughout the world (as it does in our real one).<br/>\n<br/>\nI love this idea, and think it could be a lot of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336419/#Comment_336419" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-29T15:13:17+00:00" title="July 29, 2011  3:13PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dear 2008 version of Jason Morningstar,<br><br>Please ensure that the giant meta-campaign includes were-badgers.

Well ... <br>- the game-reports may inspire our game-play<br>- the world-building and shared discussions may inspire game-masters<br/>- it may come to highten our understanding of role-players as a community of kindred souls. <br/>- it could create an interested audience, and a forum, for our lengthy tales of what goes on in our games (you know; the tales of "extra-ordinary gameplay" that not even other players are very much interested in).<br/><br/>All these are potentially great benefits of this idea.

Here was my experience:<br/><br/>* The number one organizational problem is not getting people interested, as you can see from the thread, tons of people love to do this.  The main problem is obtaining game organizers. In World of Darkness this is normally GMs.  These people exist in every game group, normally one per group, but the main issue is that they are normally already playing their own games.  Basically what you are asking is not "play this game with us!", but "stop what you're doing, organize and play a different game with us".<br/><br/>* Once things are going, the main game issue is inconsistent portrayal of the characters and setting while pursuing the themes and tones of interest to the individual games.  Like, it's not so much that the Prince is one way in this game and the Prince is another way in another game, because that's just a character with different facets. It's more that the events and decisions of one game express one group's vision of the setting and the other group doesn't share it.  Things like tone (is this a splatterfest with yuks, or a gloomy rose-smelling poetry slam?) become extremely important to how you make decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Piers" title="Piers"><img alt="Piers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Piers">Piers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337273/#Comment_337273" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T09:10:31+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  9:10AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2011 9:11AM by Piers.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like this has died again, so let me have one last go at jump starting it.  <br/><br/>The problem seems to be the organization that needs to be done before the thing can get off the ground.  So here is a version where most of the organization gets done in play as it goes along. I've deliberately chosen rules that restrict campaign making to those who play in it rather than people with time on their hands, so that the campaign doesn't grow out of proportion to the play it is designed to foster.<br/><br/>Below are a set of draft guidelines. I\u2019m going to post them in a separate thread with a link back to this one. That thread is for AP only, so if you want to comment come back here, or--if this takes off--we\u2019ll make a separate thread for commentary.  Eventually there may be a need for a wiki to organize information, but for now let's leave it to see what happens.<br/><br/>The aim is to set up some basic ground rules for building the campaign together based on AP and then just to let it happen. If you have any comments or feedback, let me know and I\u2019ll edit them into the post at the top of the AP thread.<br/><br/>Here are my suggested guidelines:<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>1. Choose a game<br/><br/>The campaign comes from actual play, so grab a game and start playing. You can use any system you\u2019d like, but to make coordination easier this is assumed to be a fantasy campaign, so pick something that will fit.<br/><br/>2. Start small<br/><br/>Build only what you need for you first session: small scale setting, situation, characters and maps. Leave large-scale politics, geography, and cosmology to develop as time goes on.  <br/><br/>3. Post Actual Play reports<br/><br/>Post descriptions of your play in this thread. Everything you contribute should come from play. The other participants will only have your AP to go on, so if you want to contribute something to the setting mention it in your report. Aim for AP about the length of a Bite Sized AP post, maybe two short paragraphs: one with an outline of the events in play, another with a list of important setting detail established during play.<br/><br/>4. Build on things others establish<br/><br/>Take the setting details from other people\u2019s AP and incorporate it into you own play.  As much as possible use \u201cYes, and \u2026\u201d as the template for your contributions.  When making up information about places that are far away or long ago, make up stories or rumours that might be true or might be false. Let your players or other groups find out which in play.<br/><br/>5. Build incrementally<br/><br/>Don\u2019t make large additions or changes to the setting at one go. Introduce new material a bit at a time and give other groups a chance to contribute to how things turn out.  No single session should radically change the setting as a whole. Keep even dramatic events relatively local so other groups have the option of including their effects in their part of the campaign or not.  Big changes should only come when multiple groups take up and build on the same material.<br/><br/>6. Have fun!<br/><br/>Make material that excites you because it will also excite others. This is a shared setting, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you have to reign in your imagination.  Go!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7769/the-big-campaign/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7769/the-big-campaign">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7769/the-big-campaign/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7769/the-big-campaign/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7769%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7769%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
