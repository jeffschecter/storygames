The GM, or the GM and players collectively, can go through the setup process to produce a setting, characters, and initial situation before starting to play.<br/><br/>An intro to the system can be found on my website (along with the rules) here:  <a href="http://ingenero.wordpress.com/about/" rel="nofollow">Ingenero website</a><br/><br/>HOWEVER.<br/><br/>Setup can take a long time, and while some players love the creative process, some <i>just wanna play right now</i>.<br/>Its also a fact that a generic system on its own is a hard sell.  A compelling situation with great characters in an inspiring setting is what sells a game.<br/><br/>So that's I'm looking for - canned scenarios to include in the Ingenero rulebook to hook people in and showcase the system.  Three to five canned scenarios seems about right.  It will depend on how many high quality submissions I receive.<br/><br/>THE DEAL:<br/><br/>The game will be published via CreateSpace which is Amazon's Print On Demand service.  I plan to sell it for around $10-$15 via print only.  My intention is to split the profits 50% between canned scenario authors and myself.  The final price of the book will depend on the number of scenarios included.  I do not want each scenario to earn less than $1 per unit solid, so the price will increased based on that.<br/><br/>Ingenero is meant for improvised play, and allowing a lot of room for GM and player imagination to build the details of the setting.  That means no plot or highly detailed setting is required.  What exactly is then required for a canned scenario?\n<ul>\n<li>    an inspiring setting -- one that hasn't already been done to death.  Sketch the setting with a broad brush.  Make it intriguing.  Provide plenty of hooks for player to build on, but don't turn every stone.  Leave space for the players to add their own stuff.  You should be thinking more of emotive descriptions, hints and hooks, rather than facts.</li>\n<li>    great characters with interesting motivations, goals and histories.  Interesting characters, not cliches.</li>\n<li>    A compelling premise and initial situation.  Something that makes a players say "I wanna play that!"  THIS IS MOST IMPORTANT.<br/>    Great layout and artwork.  The system part of the rulebook has no artwork.  Your scenarios help SELL the book.  They have to look the part.  If you aren't a good artist yourself, better make use of one, somehow.</li>\n<li>   Not more than 10-20 pages, inclusive of character sheets.</li>\n<li>    You gotta play-test your scenario.</li>\n</ul>\nA good example of what the general type of thing required is this great game by John Harper : Lady Blackbird.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/" rel="nofollow">lady blackbird</a><br/><br/>This is very light on setting detail, you can do more than that.  But remember, you are sketching the setting, mostly through a collection of emotive hooks that can be used during play, rather than describing it in detail.<br/><br/>The book itself will be color cover, interior black and white, and 8.5 x 11 inches, so theres your layout. <br/>More details when they come will be provided at the Ingenero site:  <a href="http://ingenero.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">ingenero website</a><br/><br/>sincerely,<br/><br/>Steve Mathers (stefoid)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325699/#Comment_325699" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T15:11:43+00:00" title="May 22, 2011  3:11PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds interesting.

So, that's not a huge selling point. And you're overusing "required".<br/><br/>Here are some ideas that might help your pitch in the future. (Or might not, who knows.)<br/><br/>* Get up-front about why your game is awesome and why I should be excited. Understand the audience you're talking with -- this is not the same audience as ENWorld and it isn't the same audience as RPG.net (that there's overlap and meta-overlap is true, but is still to be considered).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>Its also a fact that a generic system on its own is a hard sell.</blockquote>And you haven't sold the game by the time you've said this.<br/><br/>* Your language should be tailored to your audience. In some places, a call for scenarios like this would get met by people eager to be in print. In other places, a more human "hey, I need help, and here's what I'm offering" will get more of a response. These are functionally the same, but engage very different people.<br/><br/>* Format your post better. Edit if need-be. The formatting you've got there shows a lack of care that would turn me off as a potential contributor. "If dude isn't going to clean up his post, what's to say he'll do my work any justice."<br/><br/>* Time your proposal better. Watch when the forum's most active. Tuesday late morning/early afternoon (Pacific or Eastern Time) is a good time for a social media push, and that likely holds true here as well.<br/><br/>I'm sure you have some people interested and talking with you -- at least, I hope so. Just remember that people who say yes to these sorts of things will often flake on you, so if you're looking for three to five of these, you're looking for around ten to twenty people who will say yes. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Good luck! <br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325974/#Comment_325974" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T16:28:12+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  4:28PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2011 4:28PM by stefoid.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>Nobody interested?

That might be a way for people to see how it works quickly.</blockquote>\nI put a character sheet on the website - I havent figured out how to merge pdf files yet.<br/><br/>So if it took a couple of looks, I need to work on a summary, dont I?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326039/#Comment_326039" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T22:58:08+00:00" title="May 23, 2011 10:58PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wightbred</cite>Given the smaller investment (20 pages) you need I think flaking out will be less of a problem.</blockquote>\nIt is never less of a problem. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> People flake on 75-word bios and 750-word flash fiction entires.<br/><br/>Life happens to people all the time when they make other plans.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326040/#Comment_326040" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T23:03:17+00:00" title="May 23, 2011 11:03PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite><br/>It is never less of a problem. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> People flake on 75-word bios and 750-word flash fiction entries.<br/></blockquote>\nWow really?
