Where did I go wrong?<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pitch</b></span><br/>Like most first games of PTA, the guys went straight for sci-fi.  It started off as 'Bladerunner meets the Wire', which sounded pretty good to me, and mutated into something more difficult to describe.  There's a remote planet, industrial and corrupt.  One of its two suns, a distant star, goes out, as if someone turned off the lights.  People go ape-shit and there's civil war.  Humans, among 5 races, take the throne and rule with a pretty heavy hand.  There's a lot of suspicion and doom-saying that this is now the last planet, that the rest of the universe is now empty.<br/><br/>The series is about revolution, fear and the rise of a terrible war.  A small, buffer police department called the Gang Violence Taskforce gets involved at the beginning.  The first series tracks the rise of rebels through the eyes of these cops.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Setting</b></span><br/>Violent drama.  Projectile weapons.  Drugs, sex, violation.  5 races, Human, Rog, Fim, Shroud &amp; Sentient.  <b>Rogs</b> are bohemian gorillas with Spanish accents.  Think Silverback + Che Guevara. <b>Fim </b>are ancient, plant like creatures, once blooming under two suns, now withered and bedecked with UV fairy lights.  <b>Shrouds </b>are cloaked cadavers, a dying (excuse the pun) race that now search for compatible corpses to multiply.  <b>Sentients </b>are machines with superseding emotional and sentient intelligence, long since considered a living species.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cast</b></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> - Transcribing direct from the character sheets...</span><br/><b>Object-718</b> - A Sentient obsessed with retro, hands-on tech.

Red flashing light for eyes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Issue</span>: Trying to find out what it means to be a robot. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Edges</span>: Street Bot.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Connections</span>: Guerto, Rog Activist / Singularity, Builder (Father).<br/><br/><b>Detective Bob McMahon</b> - Young.

We do not see his face, but he is wearing a suit and carries a suitcase.  During his journey, we cut to grand preparations of some kind of political congregation.  Eventually, the man arrives at the congregation, puts the suit case on the floor and there is a murmur of confusion.  Cut to the exterior of a classical building.  There is a white flash and all the windows on every floor explode.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Intro 2</b></span><br/>Morning time.  Blues soundtrack (Rory Gallagher).  Agents are shown getting dressed, shaving, going to work.  They nearly meet one another in an elevator, but the doors close too quickly.<br/><br/><b>END Intro</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Sample Scene 1</b></span> - Character / To Introduce characters to one another / Located in the office corridor<br/>The new recruit runs up the stairs, becoming late, and spills his papers over the floor as he bumps into his superior officer.<br/><br/>(ED - At this point, the players are all very excited.  The PCs roleplay the scene.  I'm trying to work in a conflict, so when the superior officer, Haru, starts lording it over the new recruit, I have another officer try to intervene.  I tell the player that my goal is to humiliate Taka Haru.  He tells me that his goal is to be viewed as the man in charge.  I win the conflict, but the player narrates.  The player is confused as to what to do.  I ask him what happens.  He tells me.  Then we roleplay it out.  At this point, the sense of immersion is weak.)<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Sample Scene 2</b></span> - Plot / To introduce Object 718 to the bombing / Located in the Last Stand bar<br/>A gorilla's hand picks up a martini glass from a bar and carries it to a table where a drunk robot has passed out in a shady booth.  The gorilla's hand slaps the robot awake.  (ED - Now the PC takes over the narrative) The camera goes black, and winks open and closed, viewing the gorilla, Guerto, from the robot's perspective.  In a squeaky voice, the robot asks Guerto what has been going on, and the bombing is explained.  It is established that the Pax Consortium, an inter-racial pacifist collective, has been wiped out.  It's all over the news.  Object-718 investigates the footage and notices that one of the members of the consortium, before the bomb went off, was someone he knew.<br/><br/>(ED - This scene went well, but there was no conflict.  Furthermore, there was no point where Object-718 had to step out of character, and no change from the traditional GM/Player narrative structure)<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sample Scene 3</span></b> - Character / To meet the captain / Located in the captain's office<br/>The new recruit McMahon enters an office.  There is a high chair with its back to him.  Beyond the chair is a TV with details of the bombing being aired and shouts from the reporters that 'this could now mean war.'  The chair rotates around and an auburn haired police chief asks the recruit's business.<br/><br/>(ED - Not a very clear agenda as far as character was concerned.  I found it difficult to get in a conflict.  I told the PC that I wanted a conflict, and that if the player lost the stakes, he would be told he was insignificant and that nobody could make a difference any more.  He would get to work on the case but with feelings of indecision.  The PC responded that if he won the stakes, he would want to convince the captain that he was good enough for the job...  I tried to push for some more interesting results, something that would show off the small conquering of his issues, but I couldn't explain my intentions clearly.  We ran the conflict, and the player won the stakes, but the narrative shifted to a player who had spent a fan point.  He wanted us to roleplay the conversation, and he described the flow of it, and the outcome (that McMahon brought hope to the Captain).  When we got to role play it, it was fun, but it felt more like reading lines than anything else.  It ended nicely with the captain watching the door after the new recruit had left the office.)<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Summary</b></span><br/>Okay, that's enough reading.  Well done for getting this far.  Here are my thoughts and questions...<br/><br/>1)  Next time I run PTA for new players I will enforce that when it is a PC's turn to frame the scene, they should frame a scene with their own character.  PCs were shy about getting in on the action, so were framing scenes without their characters present.<br/>2)  Do you make PCs frame scenes going clockwise around the table?  I think they found that idea scary.<br/>3)  How do you avoid a sequence of 'narration followed by the roleplaying of it' (the reading out the lines phenomenon)?<br/>4)  In PTA, it describes getting into conflict as early as possible.  This means that the scene may reach a situation of meta-gaming (the discussion about how to proceed) before most of the roleplaying potential has been used up.  I find that this takes away immersion.  Is there a good example anywhere of how to run a conflict without too much discussion?  Most of the sessions with people who haven't played the game before, and from podcasts online, involve lengthy discussions about how the conflict should be resolved.<br/><br/>Ciao.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235180/#Comment_235180" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T05:53:50+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  5:53AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sebastian K.

I didn't want to be one of the major characters in any scene or the focus of a conflict, because I just didn't enjoy how conflicts were handled.  I was happier playing my PC as a sidekick character, standing on the sidelines and quipping and throwing in a single card of fan mail in a big conflict (to keep the budget economy going while minimizing the chances that I would "win" narration).  I just wanted to stay in character and never touch the system at all, which obviously doesn't work with PTA.  Fortunately(?), over half of our group felt the same way, so we just shelved the game for good and gave ourselves brownie points for trying to make it work as long as we did.<br/><br/>Makes me wonder if maybe your group wasn't shy about getting in on the action, but just felt the same way I did.  Except they're probably smarter than me, if they figured out to do this in the very first game; I didn't latch on to this strategy until, oh, our third attempt at playing it.  You might want to keep an eye out for stuff like this in future sessions and ask them what they enjoy/don't enjoy about the system just in case it turns out that PTA is a poor fit for your group, too.<br/><br/><br/>PTA is a well-designed and interesting game...so much so that even though I didn't have fun playing it and will probably never try it again, I'm still fascinated by threads about it.  I always learn something from them, even if I'm not entirely sure where or how I'll use it.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235257/#Comment_235257" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T12:49:11+00:00" title="October  2, 2009 12:49PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Pettersson</cite><cite>Posted By: Sebastian K.

But this only means the player tells the Producer who's there at the start, where they are, and what they're up to. That's no different from "We go to the thieves quarter to track down rumors" which most RPGers are familiar with.<br/><br/>3) Christian covered that one. I can't recall without the book whether the Producer can set stakes, but I know from experience that it's important not describe any detail of outcome in advance. Just set immediate goals as stakes. Leave the details of how or what happens for after the cards are resolved. Then the high card narrator can invite input and have final say on how the conflict actually resolves.If players like to play "in character" encourage them to choose some goal "in character" and push for it. The system works well this way.<br/><br/>4) What's this talk of meta-gaming? Let the players stay in character, don't discuss any possibilities, just what the current goals are.<br/><br/>What NAFT says about being shy of taking the lead in a scene really puzzles me. What is there to lose? It's like impov, a little risk has big rewards in fun. And the system actually rewards you for mixing it up.

In PtA you don't set Stakes for losing.  You only set stakes for winning.  In fact, in my PtA games I've stopped using the word Stakes.  Now what I do is I turn to each player in the scene and say, "What does your character want out of this situation?"<br/><br/>High Card player decides what the consequences are for getting/not getting what you want.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235308/#Comment_235308" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T17:52:58+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  5:52PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do players frame scenes in PTA?

Not that this is necessarily a problem, given that these were 'introduce the character' sort of scenes, but you should probably have something in mind as the Producer, in terms of how the particular scene/situation is going to push towards conflict. <br/><br/>Especially with players who may not be used to seeking conflict, a few very short, snappy conflict-oriented scenes will probably go a long way towards getting everyone into the rhythm of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235309/#Comment_235309" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T17:57:16+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  5:57PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>I thought they requested a scene in general terms, and the Producer framed the actual scene?</blockquote>\nThat is correct.  That is something else I've gotten in the habit of doing in PtA.  I don't say, "Frame a Scene."  I say, "Give me a Location, Focus and Agenda."  And then I frame the scene being sure to add characters or details if I think the scene lacks conflict potential.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235414/#Comment_235414" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-03T15:49:43+00:00" title="October  3, 2009  3:49PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So let's say I need to add more conflict.  Can someone help to illustrate the types of good conflicts that could replace the sample scenes above?  Could you take one of the scenes and push it around a bit until you think it generates conflict more easily?  I think I'm still not sure how to generate a good conflict, and that's the root of the problem.  Can you help me with that?<br/><br/>Also, any advice in how to frame a scene if you're given something without an obvious conflict?  For example, let's say a player tells me he wants a character scene, that he's trying to figure out 'who done it' and it's located in the 'forensics lab'.  If this character's issue is about finding out what it means to be a robot, how do I frame the scene to encourage conflict?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235426/#Comment_235426" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-03T17:00:58+00:00" title="October  3, 2009  5:00PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2009 5:02PM by Jesse.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "What does it mean to be a robot" is a weak issue to begin with because it doesn't map on to anything a real human being here in the real world would be dealing with.  The key to a good Issue is that it's something that real ordinary people deal with.  You then use the fantastical elements to highlight and underscore that.  However, the issue could be read to mean: What does it mean to be sentient?  Meaning, "I've been built with a purpose but have the ability to make choices."  That maps onto the real world struggle of: "People have expectations of (or even legal bonds over) me but I must live my own life."<br/><br/>As for the scene you described I'd give him "a clue" immediately right in the framing of the scene and that clue shouldn't just point at the location of another clue it should present a real choice for the character.  Looking over the character sheet, here's an example: "We cut to the lab where you're running diagnostics on the data.  Your DNA analytical sensor lights up!  You database has found a match on the Rog hair you found at the scene!  Pulling up the name you see "Guerto" printed in large bold letters.<br/><br/>That won't necessarily lead to a conflict immediately but it sets up all kinds of opportunities in the very near future.  What happens the next time Guerto and the robot meet?  What if one of the PC detectives spends a fan mail to come into the scene and asks, "Did you find anything?"  Lots of good juicy stuff there.<br/><br/>If you really, really, want to push hard right there in the scene, then have Guerto call the character on their communication device and say something like, "Hey, I need a favor."  or something.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235476/#Comment_235476" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-04T04:35:50+00:00" title="October  4, 2009  4:35AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet.  I get it now.  I've got to sort the issues out at the start.  I think my players were afraid of choosing 'normal' issues.  I tried to encourage issues that were everyday, like self confidence, but I couldn't get all the guys to bite.  Next time, I'll know what I'm looking for more clearly (as far as scene set-up) and that will help me to steer the players to choosing the right kind of issue.
