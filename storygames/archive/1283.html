                    So there's, you know, talk in <a href="http://www.therpgsite.com" rel="nofollow">other corners</a> of the internet, about "indie" sales versus "mainstream" sales and how indie sales are a drop in the bucket to mainstream and blah de blah blah blah.  Now, that we will not be getting accurate sales figures, um, <em>ever</em>, is sort of a foregone conclusion.  However, I'm wondering about a trend that I'm seeing -- or hallucinating.<br/><br/>See, I stopped buying "mainstream" games a while ago.  I mean, like, stopped dead.  Last one was <em>Blue Rose</em>, years ago.  Now, I know there are folks who straddle the fence, but I'm curious:<br/><br/><em><strong>Since you bought and played your first indie game...</strong></em><br/>1) ...have you continued to buy the same amount of mainstream game books?  More mainstream game books?  Fewer mainstream game books?  No mainstream books?<br/>2) ...have you continued to buy the same number of game books total?  More game books total?  Fewer game books total?  No game books at all?<br/>3) ...have you continued to spend the same amount of money on RPGs?  More money?  Less money?  No money at all?<br/><br/>I leave the indie/mainstream divide to the standards of the surveyee.  While I'd certainly like to hear explication, kindly give one of the provided answers first, then explicate, like so:<br/><br/>1) <strong>I buy no mainstream books.</strong>  I browse the mainstream titles, but it's more like watching a trainwreck than shopping.  The thought of purchase doesn't even occur to me.<br/>2) <strong>I buy more game books total.</strong>  I cannot get enough, and there are too many games coming out to play!<br/>3) <strong>I spend more money total.</strong>  Now, this may also have something to do with me <em>having</em> money to spend, but indie gaming has also changed my spending priorities.  I'd rather get an indie game than go to the movies, for instance.  Not so with mainstream games.<br/><br/>Obviously, if you've never bought and played any indie games, your data is not relevant to the question.  Not that the totally non-indie crowd isn't good enough for this survey or anything, but I'm curious if indie games are <em>replacing</em> mainstream games for others like they are for me.  Who knows, maybe I'm just a freak.<br/><br/>So tell me, story-games: once you go indie, is there any going back?                </div>

1) I haven't bought any mainstream games or books.<br/>

                            1) No more mainstream books for me, <i>except</i> for collection/nostalgia reasons.  I bought a cheap ($6) box of Shatterzone because I liked it when I played it, knowing I will never play it in the future.  I'm also going to get another copy of KULT when I finally locate it, for the same reasons (but only with a FLGS gift card I got).<br>2) More.  I had stopped buying game books altogether, now I bought about a dozen indie games since I started getting into them.<br>3) More.  Again, my expenditure had stopped.  Now I'm investing in well-designed indie games, both with the hopes of playing and because the innovation and raw creativity make me tingly.<br><br>In conclusion:<br/>If it wasn't for indie games, I wouldn't spend money on RPGs anymore.  I have actually <i>less</i> money to spend now than when I was first big into RPGs.  A $20 expenditure is major for me.  Still, it's been worth it so far.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            For many years I was a one-system at a time type of guy. I'd latch onto GURPS, d20, d6, whatever. I got involved in the creation of Savage Worlds (and am continuing to write my own book for Savage Worlds) about 2-3 years ago, and haven't bought anything but SW up until about two months ago. At that time, I started to seriously read The Forge and Story Games, and bought some iRPGs. And now...yes, I can't get enough (cue Depeche Mode, "I Just can't get enough"), and I'm spending more money on games than I have in a long while.<br/><br/>I don't think I will go back to traditional/mainstream RPGs. I'm too enthralled with all the ideas floating around the iRPG world.                        </div>

                            Well, so I'm not sure exactly when I went indie.  Was it [u]Theatrix[/u] in 1994?  [u]Baron Munchausen[/u] in 1999?  But on the assumption that "indie" here means Forge-related, I'll answer for [u]Sorcerer[/u] in 2003 (though I didn't play it).  <br/><br/>1) I buy the same amount of mainstream books.<br/>2) I buy more game books total. <br/>3) I spend more money total.<br/><br/>So, basically for me they're an extra on top.                        </div>

                            Great thread idea.<br/><br/>I buy fewer game products in general (I've gotten much pickier) and virtually zero mainstream games (aside from a few <i>Exalted</i> books that Rebecca Borgstrom was involved with, because her design sense is nuts).<br/><br/>I think this has three main causes:<br/>1) I don't read game books for fun anymore (which I used to do a LOT)<br/>2) I buy game books mostly because I'm interested in learning game design techniques from them.<br/>3) I only buy games I'm planning on playing.<br/><br/>To summerize: if I don't think that I, as a game designer and a player, will grow and develop from reading and playing your game, I'm unlikely to buy it (unless I can learn something from your crazy awesome graphic design, but that's another issue entirely).                        </div>

                            Hmm, for me, defining indie purchase is difficult. Assuming we include any game that has a forum on the Forge, then my first indie game purchase was Hero Wars. Since then:<br/><br/>1) I have bought 1000s of dollars of mainstream games (I ended up getting into D20 in the meantime)<br/>2) I have bought more game books total<br/>3) I have spent more money (my gaming horizons expanded, plus more disposable income, plus vowing not to get caught not buying something because I wasn't into it right then, and then it being gone an unavailable when I became interested again - all fueled by RuneQuest)<br/><br/>To be honest, I'm not yet sold on the indie game movement. The concept is great, but the games coming out aren't really addressing my needs.<br/><br/>Of course neither is mainstream gaming. Though D20 has come the closest to meeting my needs for a LONG time.<br/><br/>After a bunch of failures with indie/story games, I'm starting to think about being ultra-conservative.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

<p>1)  Since finding my hippie indieness I have purchased exactly one 'mainstream' game.  A mint condition Red Box D&amp;D set off of Ebay.<br/>
2)  I don't spend as much money on buying the books as I did when I was hip-deep in either Shadowrun or Mage.  However, I am spending more money on game books than I did in the years immediately preceeding my first indie purchase.<br/>
3)  I spend <em>way</em> more money on RPGs than I ever have before.  Mostly because I spend money to go meet the people I've met online and play games with them.  Hotels at conventions are my biggest expenditure.</p>

                            1) I buy almost no mainstream books. The last one was Mutants &amp; Masterminds 2nd Ed.<br/><br/>2) I buy many more game books total now. Since I've got a group devoted to indie games and I design games myself (hopefully with publication to follow), I make it a point to buy most of what comes out. Plus, you all have put out some awesome games.<br/><br/>3) I think I spend marginally more than when I was a d20 gamer. I buy a lot of books, but they're cheaper on average than in the old days. Plus, the lack of regular supplements means my buying tends to clump (a bunch at Gen Con, the occasional big IPR purchase once I've hit free shipping level, etc.).<br/><br/>And no, Joshua, I don't think there's any going back.

                            Hmm, well I only came back to roleplaying after not playing anything for about five years. I stumbled across a blog entry about DitV in early '05, and searched around some more, and haven't really gone back. I'm going to take my "before" as when I was playing regularly before that in the late 90s.<br/><br/>1) <b>I buy no mainstream books.</b> My girlfriend bought me the <i>Serenity</i> RPG for my birthday, which kind of reinforced my perception of mainstream games 'missing the point'. I've been tempted to pick up the nWoD core rulebook because it sounds a lot better than the oWoD system, and I'd like to see what has changed. I might also get the D&amp;D3.5 PHB because I play an occasional game of that at a newly-found wargames club. But otherwise I look through the stuff on the shelves of my FLGS and nothing really jumps out at me.<br/><br/>2) <b>I buy slightly less game books total.</b> I used to pick up pretty much every Shadowrun, Heavy Gear and oWoD Mage book produced for years and years and years, as well as other systems that caught my eye. Nowadays I get a lot of the new indie games, but as I'm over in the UK, shipping costs give me pause. <br/><br/>3)  <b>I think I spend less money now.</b> I used to buy a lot of mainstream books from my FLGS, but even with shipping and currency conversion, I think I spend less now than I used to. But with you guys selling in $ and me thinking in Â£, I can't really get a sense of how much things cost.<br/><br/>I still <i>play</i> mainstream games; the aformentioned D&amp;D (I tend to let other players create the character for me, as the way we play, it's little more than a wargames unit anyway, so I don't need a lot of books) and oWoD stuff (that group is dismissive of the nWoD for setting reasons, so most of my old books still work).                        </div>

                            1. I buy fewer mainstream books. I still pick up some, Mutants and Masterminds stuffs, some D&amp;D stuff here and there (especially the well done D&amp;D stuff that actually plays to the game's strengths), and I trade swag for Ars Magica, Blue Rose, and Exalted books pretty frequently. <br/><br/>2. I probably buy the same number of books as before. Now, however, I buy many more core books and far fewer supplements. It used to be I'd have two to four gamelines going, and would buy all the sups for them. Now I buy almost exclusively MRBs only -- both for Indie and Trad games. <br/><br/>3. I spend less money over all on books. This is because of the point Jonathan brought up -- I don't buy to read much anymore. There are too many good games out now, and I don't even have time to read them all, much less play them. So unless I'm fairly sure I'm going to play a game I'm unlikely to buy it at all. This has led to less money being spent, as there are only so many hours a week I can actually play game.<br/><br/>Edit: So, I guess for me there isn't so much of a "going back" as a "I never really left either mode." For me the Copernican Revolution hasn't been so much in what I buy, as in how I approach game. I still buy Green Ronin books, for example, I just play them differently than I used to. (Which in part means I actually play them at all.)                        </div>

                            Hey Josh,<br/>
<br/>
I buy no mainstream books.  In fact, I took it one step futher.  When we moved I put all my mainstream books (even my beloved 7th Sea books) in storage.<br/>
I buy less game books total although I was never THAT heavy of a game book collector, 7th Sea being the exception.<br/>
I spend less money over all despite the $500+ hypothetical bill I ran up at indie-press revolution.<br/>
<br/>
I was given Serenity as a gift and when I read it I immediately blew all kinds of holes in the design despite its simplicity.  No, I can't go back.  Nor do I want to.  The biggest "Not going back" happened this year.<br/>
<br/>
1) I made two New Years Resolutions back in January.  First I promised that I would never play another role-playing game with an overly detailed setting.  The second was that I promised I would no longer compromise my own personal investment and interest in the hobby simply to accomodate others.<br/>
<br/>
2) In March I basically acted on both of these by disbanding both of my regular groups and then reforming them by writing up a very clear statement of what I was interested in and what I wanted to do.  In one group I lost 3 out of 5 players and lost another one shortly thereafter.  I'm happier and I'm sure they're happier to.  No grudges (they still come to Doctor Who and GeekCon).<br/>

<b>1) I buy no mainstream books: </b>My first indie was FATE, and that game made me realize that by buying all those mainstream books I was essentially trying to cram a round peg into a square hole and wondering why it never worked. Indie games give me that round peg I needed.<br/><br/>I will confess, though, a burning desire to hit eBay and rebuild my AD&amp;D 1st ed collection (which I was forced to sell many years ago). All those threads that Judd keeps starting are filling me with a powerful sense of nostalgia.<br/><br/><b>2) I buy more game books total: </b>I used to focus on one mainframe line at a time, and largely ignore the others. I'd hit the LGS every few months and see what new modules, splats, etc were available. Now a days, I'm finding a metric ton of great indie games calling to me. Where I'd buy maybe one or two new mainframe books a quarter back in the day, I bought six new indie games in the last month or so.<br/><br/><b>3) I spend more money now: </b>I probably spend more money now. Some games I've bought cost about what a WW splat or D&amp;D module costs, if not less. Some are much less (especially when I buy the PDF, something I'm moving away from). Then there's the hardcover bricks, Burning Empires and Spirit of the Century. Yeah, I believe at the end of the day I'm spending more.                        </div>

                            1.) Since buying MlwM I haven't bought a mainstream book that I can recall.

I spend about the same amount on RPG books, but I've dropped my spending on miniatures and CCGs to 0. Mostly because I see that as a phase I've moved past, I guess.                        </div>

I've never played D&amp;D. Before a couple months ago, I was not interested in D&amp;D. Period.  Now, however, I'm actually really interested in the 'Basic Game' or the British boardgame version, because I wanna play it as a miniatures fighty-game.  So, yeah, indie games have gotten me more exacted about <i>games in general</i>, because I've finally gotten over the angst of growing up with Palladium.                        </div>

Since buying Sorcerer, I'm buying games again. Never a mainstream game. (See Joshua's other thread for comments on this.)<br/>

<p><em>I buy less mainstream games.</em> I still buy some, but less than $100 a year. When I do buy them, it's usually for design research purposes, although I'm on fire for Iron Gauntlets right now (which is an indie game, but you guys are totally talking about design philosophy here, and IG is old-school.) My last real mainstream purchase was Blue Rose, and I ran it last weekend - and I just couldn't GM that way any more. It was really hard!</p>
<p><em>I buy the same amount of books overall.</em> Or maybe a few more. I don't know. I've been at this indie game for longer than many. I used to buy a crackload of Gurps books. Then I didn't buy many games for years, and now I buy about two books/month.</p>
<p><em>I spend more on RPGs.</em> I think. Again, I've been at this a while, but the economic reality of books means I'm spending more than ever on them.</p>

                            I buy the same amount of mainstream books. Mostly they are source books. Many GURPS books are excellent sources of ideas, which I buy even though I never have or will play GURPS. <br/>
<br/>
I buy more books in general. My group switches game every five episodes, and I always buy a game if I'm going to play it. I rarely buy a game I'm not going to play unless it represents a genre or setting I'm very, very interested in.<br/>
<br/>
I spend more on RPGs, though not by much. I don't like to buy things I'm not going to play. What HAS suffered in the year and half since I went indie is my miniatures gaming expenditures. This has gone from around $500a year to nothing. In the time I would spend putting a Warhammer army together, I could design and play a complete indie game.                        </div>

<blockquote>1) ...have you continued to buy the same amount of mainstream game books?  More mainstream game books?  Fewer mainstream game books?  No mainstream books?</blockquote>
I can say that, yes, I buy less mainstream books than I used to. However, I still did buy almost every Exalted fatsplat (skim, mine for info, then resell within 2 weeks; Except Exalted 2e, which I have on my shelf as my Go-To game for High Action Fantasy), Blue Rose, Conan OGL (dumped it after play, though; however I am very much looking forward to Conan BRP).<br/><br/>For me, this reason is surely seeped in "buying only what I'll play", just like others. However, I'm sure there are other reasons for it to: Sure, nowadays many (note: of course not ALL, but some) Indie games scratch an itch I have. Thing is, before the Indie movement of the very late 90s early 2000s, there were some great mainstream games that came out doing well what they do best: Blue Planet. Heavy Gear. Metabarons. Aberrant. Deadlands. Tribe 8. L5R. They were seeped in all that "awesome/rich background! New rules!" that mainstream games boast, but at the time these were Fringe games- Still mainstream, still seeped in Skill Rolls Against Your Attribute and all that. So I was totally out there buying, reading, doing a lot of collecting to be sure, and some playing. <br/><br/>But something else that coincidentally happened at the same time as Indie games were starting to come out, was the derth of d20, and the eventual shitslide and dry-up of a huge wash of generally ho-hum bullshit.  In the last 5 years, there have been no games in the mainstream like the above that I mentioned; Many of the above came back in the last 5 years with a new edition. The unique ones stand out; like Fireborn, which I am led to believe is an interesting rules-system, a contemplative setting, but very broken in several ways (system and setting). I can't think of any other mainstream game to come out in the last few years that wasn't d20 or OGL that made an impact on people by way of its uniqueness of setting or rules.<br/><br/>Well, other than Exalted.  Which is apparently doing awesomely.<br/><br/>Does anybody else see what I'm describing here, or is it just me? 
<blockquote>2) ...have you continued to buy the same number of game books total?  More game books total?  Fewer game books total?  No game books at all?</blockquote>
Hmmm. Probably 'about the same', honestly. Perhaps a liiiiittle more than before. I still have only 2 shelves on my bookshelf that contain English RPGs. Any time my collection hits the end of that second shelf, I start selling shit off that I don't play anymore (or won't play).
<blockquote>3) ...have you continued to spend the same amount of money on RPGs?  More money?  Less money?  No money at all?</blockquote>
I would say more money overall, as games are a little more expensive now than they were before. And like others, my disposable income increased by several factors in the past few years alone.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I suspect Ars Magica was technically Indie back in the Lion Rampant days (at least when it first came out), but I'm not sure where my copy of Ars 1st has gotten to so I can't be certain. But if I'm correct, that was my first indie game.<br/><br/>1. Anyway, these days I very, very rarely buy a mainstream book. In the past two years or so, I think I've purchased Pendragon 5th and a Rune supplement.<br/><br/>2. I buy far fewer books in general. I only buy games I will play in the next six months. Since I am only one of the game purchasers in the group that focuses on trying new games, that's only a few books a year.<br/><br/>3. I spend far, far less money. While I am 110% behind the DIY ethic and support it enthusiastically, I won't compromise my only buy what will get played rule.<br/><br/>My personal experience in the past 10 years or so has been that my degree of RPG spending has been inversely proportional to the amount of actual playing I've been doing. The more I play, the less I spend. In the years when I was moving around a lot and didn't have a group, I sought to remain "connected" to the hobby by buying and reading RPG material. It was expensive, fruitless and kinda sad.<br/><br/>These days, I have trouble understanding how someone who is actually playing games could find the hobby expensive. I can certainly understand why collectors who don't play might feel that way, but I have trouble finding sympathy for that perspective.                        </div>

But since I was burned out on role-playing until I found the indie games, I was at zero. So if you go by my habits back when I was into gaming:<br/>
<br/>
1) Less<br/>
2) Less<br/>
3) Less<br/>
<br/>
Weird.                        </div>

                            I was more or less in Warren/Andrew's situation  (though I didn't so much burn out of roleplaying as grow - in a non-directional sense - away from it) of coming into indie from the cold, so it's a bit hard to compare. The available expenditure - pocket money at 15 vs my leisure spending now -  wouldn't be a fair comparison.. well, I hope not, as it would really depress me (13 long years of study and work for <i>this</i>?).<br><br>But I would say I am probable spending slightly less money, on more books, and all are indie.

                            1) Hmmmm. I've never been a heavy games buyer, but I picked up a number of mainstream books (nWoD, Paranoia XP, HERO 5th and a couple supplements, D&amp;D 3.5) since I bought the first edition of Burning Wheel, which I never managed to play. Now since I've <i>played</i> my first indie game I haven't bought any mainstream games.<br/><br/>2) More. At the moment I've bought more books in the last year than I ever have before. This may trickle off as I was largely doing 'catch up' on what I perceived as games I needed to read to become familiar with the indie movement and feel 'literate'. Then again, I brought home a small bundle of games from GenCon, so it may be that in the future my purchases are made at Cons and such.<br/><br/>3) More. I think I've spent more money in the last year on indie games than I've ever spent on 'traditional' RPGs, but not by much. Again, this may trickle off now that I've made my 'big plunge' of literacy purchases. I can't tell.                        </div>

<br/>
Before I bought Dogs in the Vineyard I hadn't bought any game or game book in years, having been on the GURPS - GURPS Lite - FUDGE - Homebrew path to nirvana.  I'm pretty sure I spent more money on games at Gen Con than I spent during my entire gaming career to date.<br/>
<br/>
My story's pretty similar with the addition that before Dogs and Sorcerer, I hadn't spent a dime on an RPG-product in, oh, well over 10 years. I ALMOST bought the Hellboy-RPG, but thankfully didn't. Since then, I've bought about the same amount of books in little over a year that I did all the years before combined. Pretty spectacular.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I didn't go to GenCon, unfortunately :-)<br/>

                            1) I buy fewer mainstream books now<br/>2) I buy fewer books now than a decade ago<br/>3) I am spending far less money on rpgs than I did a decade ago<br/><br/>I am in a similar boat as jhkim in that as a very avid game collector I have bought everything that came down the pike since the 80s.  Interstellar Elite, Fantasy Wargaming, Quest of the Ancients... if you could buy it in a game store I probably own it.  Although I certainly had my D&amp;D years (and I bought into d20 big time from 2000 - 2003) I had always been into the less mainstream games.  I once went to a convention and had every game I signed up for wash, pretty much becasue it wasn't D&amp;D (Deadlands, Fading Suns, etc).<br/><br/>However I stopped collecting three years ago when I bought Burning Wheel.  It's a long complicated story but I decided that I needed to tighten up my standards for games and that I could no longer justify my purchases just for a hint of a good idea I might find.  <br/><br/>My buying went from $600 a month to barely $60 a year.  This past Origins and my further involvement in the Forge brought my monthly RPG purchases to $60 a month and will probably stay steady at that - mostly indie games.  I very much doubt a d20 book that isn't Green Ronin will find it's way into my shelves any time soon.                        </div>

                            1. Hardly any mainstream books at all. I bought some Pendragon and Buffy stuff about a year ago because it was on sale; also, I'll buy anything Norwegian.<br/>
<br/>
2. This always fluctuates, but I think I buy more core books, and hardly any supplements. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>

3. This also fluctuates. Probably more, since before I got into the indie thing I had a period where I didn't think there was anything worth buying out there.                        </div>

<blockquote><b>Since you bought and played your first indie game...</b><br/>1) ...have you continued to buy the same amount of mainstream game books?  More mainstream game books?  Fewer mainstream game books?  No mainstream books?</blockquote>
Roughly the same. A few years ago, before disovering indie games and opening a game store, I decided to seriously cut down on my purchases. So, I buy a game/supplement every 2-3 months, maybe.  Buying and playing Burning Wheel and Universalis didn't change that.<br/>
<blockquote><br/>2) ...have you continued to buy the same number of game books total?  More game books total?  Fewer game books total?  No game books at all?</blockquote>
About the same.<br/>
<blockquote>3) ...have you continued to spend the same amount of money on RPGs?  More money?  Less money?  No money at all?</blockquote>
About the same.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm still trying to grok the whole indie scene, which is why I hang-out/lurk here.<br/><br/>     --Jason                        </div>

                            1) I haven't bought a mainstream book in years. I was into the GURPS books, but they seem to have stopped with the 128 pg historical overviews and the like, which is what I dug.<br/>
<br/>
2) I buy a lot fewer books than I did 4 years ago when I was being paid ridiculously well, but overall, I buy more than at other times in my gaming life; mostly, I've played homebrew systems, so purchases weren't a big part of my gaming experience.<br/>
<br/>
3) Consequently, I'm spending more money, save for the 4-year ridiculousness.<br/>
<br/>
Looking up right now, I've got about 8 feet of bookshelf devoted to RPGs of various stripes. Of those, about 1 foot is the stuff I'm interested in playing at this point. After that come a couple of games I want to steal stuff from or otherwise respect and some GURPS sourcebooks that I think are interesting, and then a dribbly bunch of stuff that I've wound up with that goes on for another 6 feet before it turns into my Crackpot section (conspiracy theories, radionic multiple wave oscillators, and the like).<br/>
<br/>
I just have to need to add to those six feet.                        </div>

                            Gurps doesn't do the historical books anymore I don't think.<br/>
<br/>
One thing struck me that I missed before, actually the indie games are partly why I buy fewer games.Not because I now play mostly indie games, but because the focus at the Forge on actual play and on buying to play made me reconsider my own buying habits and directly led me to buying fewer games.<br/>
<br/>
Still mostly trad games, but fewer and I also sold and am selilng a ton of stuff I wasn't really ever going to use.<br/>
<br/>
So, I think actually indie games did influence my buying habits and for the better, or the Forge did, not sure quite which.  Now when I want to buy I ask myself, will I actually play this?  Before I somehow forgot to ask that obvious and crucial question.                        </div>

<i>Since you bought and played your first indie game...</i><br/><br/><b>1) A whole lot less.</b>  Now, my buying was already on the decline as I gained faith in my own capacity to produce material.  Indie games just pushed the accelerator on my escape.  I doubt I am even buying 10% what I used to.  At one point, I would go into my gaming store once or twice a month and not be able to leave without buying something.  My local gaming store went out of business with like two months warning and I didn't even notice until a week before they shut their doors (even then, only because it came up in casual conversation with a friend).  My last purchase was one of the Blue Rose books.  I think before that, I bought Exalted 2e (just because I wanted to see what the buzz was about).  And one of the Eberron supplements.  Before that Castles and Crusades.  That may be my mainstream purchases for the last twelve months or more.<br/><br/><b>2) Fewer books overall</b>--indie games put me off the supplement train almost entirely.  I just don't have any desire to buy to read any more.  I truly believe I can do as well or better in terms of my own creative output, esp. as directed to a game I would play in.  I am largely buying now to put together my own little indie game library, so I can reference the 'fundamentals' and keep track of the innovations....and I fully expect to *use* all of them at some point to, you know, play.  <br/><br/><b>3) Tons less money.</b>  In part because a good indie game tends to run me around twenty dollars, whereas the supplements for the mainstreams were starting to run me forty or more dollars.  Buy fewer, and cheaper, wow, my pocket book loves me.  I probably broke close to even with going to gencon (travel, hotel) because of the money I *hadn't* been spending on mainstream games.  I have actually, gasp, been tempted to buy an Exalted book again, but literally *just* because I like the pretty pictures.  I still haven't gotten around to reading through the heart of the core Exalted book.                        </div>

<b>1. I never buy 'mainstream' games.</b> After getting HQ in 2000, supplements for it were all I acquired for years.

I reckon I've spent about US$100+ on indie games since buying <i>Sorcerer</i>, so I ain't your best customer. I doubt I've ever spent much more than that on games.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>Heh,<br/><br/>Matthijs brings up a point. Greg Stafford.</blockquote>
I agree and I'll throw Robin Laws into the mix. I dig HeroQuest/Glorantha a lot, so I pick up HeroQuest stuff when it comes out. But I do play HeroQuest now and then, so the stuff actually gets use and doesn't run afoul of my "buy only what you'll play" rule.<br/><br/>I also, to date, have bought every game Robin has written. Robin certainly isn't indie, but his designs kick serious ass. I'm really looking forward to playing some Rune in the coming months, for example.<br/><br/>Honestly, for me, the only distinction "indie" holds that has any real merit is that indie games are a product of the punk DIY ethic. Indie games are creator-owned and creator-controlled. They're about creating, owning and controlling your own intellectual property. And that is awesome!<br/><br/>Everything else that people associate with indie games can be duplicated in the mainstream. And it has been. <br/><br/>There are three games that created a serious theoretical foundation for the system ideas that have grown out of the Forge (no, they're not the only ones, but they were arguably the most important). They were: Theatrix, Over the Edge and Everway.<br/><br/>How many of them were indie?                        </div>

<blockquote>1) ...have you continued to buy the same amount of mainstream game books?  More mainstream game books?  Fewer mainstream game books?  No mainstream books</blockquote>
I still buy mainstream books, but probably fewer and with more scrutiny. My regular games are HERO and D&amp;D, so I'm willing to buy for them. As much as I want to be really strict and Thor-like, I am a slave to HERO, and buy pretty much everything released for it. It was also hard to pass up Ptolus.<br/><br/>I know, I need help.<br/><br/>But, outside of HERO, I've become a lot stingier. At GenCon, the only reason I went home with any d20 books is because they were on severe discount and had gotten good press. Otherwise, it was three new HERO books and probably half of everything at the IPR booth. <br/><br/>In addition, a lot of books got purged from my collection post-indie-indoctrination. Mainstream games look so similar to me now ("Same game, different dice") that booting them is less of a problem.<br/><br/>Granted, I may very well never play any of these indie games much, as my two current groups are quite jackass-like w/r/t to playing anything that is not, respectively, D&amp;D or HERO. I try to run them at Gamedays, at the least. However, reading indie stuff expands my widdle gamer brain so much that I can deal. These games and Forge theory in general have had a massive impact on how I look at D&amp;D and HERO.
<blockquote>2) ...have you continued to buy the same number of game books total?  More game books total?  Fewer game books total?  No game books at all?</blockquote>
My average has probbaly gone down a bit. It's hard to say, as even though my purchase of mainstream stuff has gone down, I've been "catching up" on indie games.
<blockquote>3) ...have you continued to spend the same amount of money on RPGs?  More money?  Less money?  No money at all?</blockquote>
Probably about the same, though I've been slowly whittling down my budget.<br/><br/>The day may come when I simply don't feel a need to buy any more D&amp;D or HERO books... but I'm not there yet. The collector in me is still strong.                        </div>

                            Yeah, there are quite a few "indie feeling" books released by roleplaying publishers that are largely, design wise, the work of a single individual (or a few individuals) and occasionally even owned by them.  Notably:<br/><br/>Lots of stuff by Robin Laws<br/>Lots of stuff by Greg Stafford<br/>Nobilis<br/>Everway<br/>The original Ars Magica?<br/>Jared's game in The Requiem Chronicler's Guide<br/>Lots of made-in-my-basement games that later made it big<br/><br/>Personally, I consider these to be more-or-less indie games while other people may think the glass is half empty instead.

                            1) I buy less mainstream books, mostly Call of Cthulhu but also the occasional Unisystem or GURPS product (mind you I'll probably not buy anymore GURPS).<br/>
<br/>
2) I buy more books because I buy loads of indie stuff. I also download lots of free pdfs many of which I never even read.<br/>
<br/>
3) I spend about the same amount on RPGs because Indie books are cheap and the pound is strong. I was responsible for 1.5% of Indie sales at Gen Con but I'll probably not buy some for a while (yeah, right!)                        </div>

More money.<br/><br/>To add context to the above.... <br/><br/>Indie games have increased my interest in RPGs in general. I buy more games, because I play more often. In NYC, we have a large group of people (close to 20) who came back into gaming after being on a hiatus from 5-14 years and were reintroduced to the hobby via Indie games. But this also works both ways. They have been brought back by Indie games, but as our interest in gaming grows, we buy/play more of both Indie and Mainstream games. My purchasing habbits are directly tied to my playing habits.<br/><br/>Because I buy (at least 1 a month) and play more games (2-4 times a week), I buy less comic books, DVDs, and video games. Which also means I play a lot less video games and watch less DVDs. To add further context, I also have much less time on my hands than I did years ago. I'm almost 29, work 50-70 hours a week, spend a lot of time with my fiancÃ©, manage over 30 employees, travel constantly between NY, LA, and Vancouver, and have 2 side companies beyond my full time work. We also play shorter games, 3-4 hours, with less players 3-4, rarely play the same game for more than 3-6 sessions, and our commute times are negligible. Our players are always changing, coming from a pool of 50+, and with different players come different tastes, which leads to more purchases.<br/><br/>This is a cool survey but aren't we skewing the results to an extreme degree by posting it here vs. on RPG.net?                        </div>

                            1) It seems to be about the same for me in that for every indie game I buy, I buy one mainstream game. Sometimes it veers one way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
2) I think I'm buying more books, yes. I like it and don't begrudge the money I spend.<br/>
<br/>
3) Basically yes. I buy a lot more than I used to. I was into another hobby a couple years back that made gaming look dirt cheap by comparison. Once I got out of that, my gaming expenditures skyrocketed.                        </div>

                            context: I bough *a lot* of roleplaying game books during university, most of which were fringe or strange, and noone ever played with me. All in all, it was mainstream nonetheless.<br/><br/>I stopped buying RPG books halfway through my studies because I thought I'd seen all that was to see. This was basically when I first ran into indie games in the form of Fudge. <br/><br/>It may not shock you there was a time when I dumped a great majority of my books after they proved unsellable even on ebay for the minimum price of â‚¬1.<br/><br/>1) I buy less mainstream games. There are a couple of lines I think are generally well done (i.e. Mutants and Masterminds), but the real money is with indie and/or pdf products.<br/><br/>2) I am buying more books than 2000-2003, especially since I buy cheap pdfs for the occasional nice idea.<br/><br/>3) I guess I spend more money, and most of it online. I love to buy direct from the author.<br/><br/>Also, I don't see a reason to throw away RPG books ever again. My tastes have developed, it seems.                        </div>

                            1. Less, though I still buy some now and then.<br/><br/>2. Less, overall, and indie games make up a large portion of what I do buy.<br/><br/>3. Less, but that's partly because lately I'm trying harder to curb my spending and not buy games I don't think I'll actually get around to playing, and partly because my present collection, plus stuff I'm designing myself, is enough to last for ages.                        </div>

                            Joe's got an interesting point, but I think that even the best designers here love to play games that other people made.

                            Well, for stat's sake, here go I. <br/>
<br/>
1) I buy less mainstream gaming books. Of those few I had, I even sold one. <br/>
2) I belueve I buy more game books total. I stopped buying mainstream books around three years ago (although I do peruse reviews and the occasional supplement at the FLGS.) OTOH the Indie books I purchased since then (counting PDF books) had almost tripled my RPG collection. <br/>
Tangent: These days I also buy more SF/F books overall, mostly due to my renewed interest in roleplaying games. <br/>
3) I spend a bit more money on RPGs than before (erm, especially since some indie titles didn't come out too cheap). <br/>

                            1) I still play mainstream RPGs, and do so more than with indie games. (which I read and shelve more often than actually play) It used to be that the majority of indie games just did nothing for me, now I'm finding more that I like. In either case, I play the games that I and my friends have created more than any published games, indy or otherwise. In comparison to these, I hardly play at all.<br/>
2) I buy a few less books than I used to. This isn't from lack of interest so much as having everything I want that is currently available. I have to wait for new releases.<br/>
3) I spend a little less, but that's because I've got most everything I want at this point, and new stuff only comes out so fast.<br/>
<br/>
Most of my time is spent with personal projects.                        </div>

                            Until recently, I don't think I'd bought any RPGs at all since 1990 or so. Once I started to get back into gaming I bought a variety of stuff including some indie games, but I didn't really play an indie game until a few months into that.<br/><br/>1. I probably buy more mainstream than indie stuff, but all of the former is bought secondhand via eBay, used book stores, and game stores' used shelves. Whereas the indie stuff has been a mix of new/used. My criterion is, I try not to buy a game at retail unless I'm pretty confident I will get a chance to play it. (BTW, my definition of indie for the purposes of this questionnaire is "Forge stuff". I've bought OTE, Theatrix, and Everway, as well as Heroquest, in the last year or so, but I don't count them.)<br/><br/>2. More, because I'm exploring a variety of games. Also, some of the discussion and articles on the Forge and here have been pretty influential in what I seek out. (See above. Though I've also picked up parts of Blue Planet, Jovian Chronicles, Feng Shui, etc.)<br/><br/>3. More, but not all that much. My spending on hobby stuff lately has largely shifted from wargames, videogames, and toys, to RPGs. Overall I'd guess I spend under $30/month on games, probably under $20.<br/><br/>The main influence of "indie" on my active participation in the hobby is that the hype about all the games has significantly motivated me to try and go play them, by organizing a sort of "experimental gaming group", visiting mini-cons in my area, and hooking up with a regular "mainstream" group (albeit one that, due to distance and schedule, I haven't been able to get together with for a while).                        </div>

                            My first indie? Hmmm... Maybe Puppetland in Arcane?  Followed by the Baron and Pantheon, Sorcerer and MLwM<br/><br/>1) A steep decline. I still buy mainstream rpgs at used book stores for half price to see what is going on, but the most I do is breeze through them. I'll buy them, but I can't stand to even read them anymore. It's painful. Too much of everything. I remember reading the DMG for AD&amp;D 1st edition a dozen times cover to cover... I can't imagine doing that today.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I'm trying to shake this...<br/><br/>2) Fewer books. Far fewer.<br/><br/>3) Less money. If I do buy a game book, it's on Amazon or at the used book store. I can't justify spending more money on games I won't play anymore. I wish I'd stop buying the stuff entirely, but it is good to see what is going on in mainstream gaming.                        </div>
