With <b>This Is Pulp</b>, all the players had in the beginning was a small sheet that had some circles in it, three side effects - "getting hurt, getting delayed, destroys something" - and then a sentence that described the archetype: "The nosy kid that always shows up everywhere". I played with this ten times with different groups and took notes on how the sentences was interpreted by the players.<br/><br/>The next stage was to <a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/tip/doc/TiP_George_Miller_Jr.pdf" rel="nofollow">create how I pictured the archetypes</a> in the first place, and used the experience that I got while playtesting the game. I continued to see how the game was interpreted by the players, and I also started to jot down how I lead the game and the difference in how others game mastered my own game. After ten more playtests, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17608/this-is-pulp-the-structure-of-the-rulebook#Item_1" rel="nofollow">I wrote my game</a> and the next stage is rewriting and finally find people that can do blind playtests so I can see how the text is interpreted.<br/><br/>This is a very easy way of creating a game. You get free input from the players, you are more open to suggestions because you haven't spend time writing it down, having the game look bad makes the players want to give suggestions on how to improve it, you don't have to rewrite the game just because you revise it, you can add more and more things as you go and playtest those parts thoroughly, you gather a solid base of information before you start to write it. With another game, I wrote 50 pages, put it in a layout and got people to proofread it, all in two weeks. Lets say I wrote it all in ten days, that's five written pages a day. All it took was one year of playtesting.<br/><br/>I wrote my first game before I playtested it. It took 3-4 months to write and I rewrote it after each revision of the rules while I was playtesting it. It took me approximately more than 300 written pages to get the 112 pages that the game landed on.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407330/#Comment_407330" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-26T07:03:09+00:00" title="February 26, 2013  7:03AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, my group of players aren't exactly designers but they really came with interesting ideas and opinions about my designs when we tried them as rough concepts on the table. Whenever people are involved in playing a game is part of their nature to make that game fun, hence their early playtesting input is so helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
