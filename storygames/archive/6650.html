I printed a short description of each character to provide inspiration.  For abilities, I changed the rule so that the players could choose mundane and everyday equipment and abilities for their characters, and by choosing them, they'd be the only people left in the world with that ability or equipment.  I changed the background questions as well.<br/><br/>The setup was a small town with the last functional power plant, being threatened by raiders from a dark tower in the West.  The characters would be people of the town, or outsiders, sent to kill "the Witch" before the town was lost.<br/><br/>The situation for play was not exactly ideal.  We had about six hours on a Sunday night, so we'd be racing against the clock to finish before we all had to go to bed.  We also had a cranky baby with us, who kind of put a cramp on the mood.  That's the reality of playing with busy people and with parents - you play when you can.<br/><br/>We also had a high proportion of new players, which I tend to see as an opportunity more than a hindrance, but it did end up affecting the game in some ways, I think.<br/><br/>Our characters were:<br/><br/>Vlad "The Emperor", one of the last soldiers.  He owned the only scoped rifle left in the world.  He'd been seperated from his unit during the riots in LA.  Killing the Witch meant settling in the town in peace.<br/><br/>Fiona "the Hermit", the last doctor.  An outsider to the town, and very mysterious.<br/><br/>Faith "the Magician".  The last mechanic.  Actually a mechanical engineer, she's been working in the town since the apocalypse, fixing machinery.  Very competent.<br/><br/>Grimlea, "the Devil".  A herbalist.  <br/><br/>I'm not going to go into a play-by-play of what happened.  The game had some really good moments, and some not so good ones.  I think that the rushed play, and the inexperience of the players made people reluctant to talk to each other "in character", which made the emotional connections between the characters feel a little weak.  "Fiona" suffered a little from "my guy" syndrome.  While her player probably did the best job of revealing her Dark Fate (her "Worst Fear" was dying from the mutant strain of the virus she was infected with, and being unable to cure it), it also meant she played her own game a little too much, and didn't connect to the other characters much.  "Grimlea"'s player hadn't really roleplayed before, and I think she was a little overwhelmed (she also took on a lot of the baby-caring duties, which didn't help).  Her character was "Desperately in Love" with Faith, which led to a few touching scenes, (including saver her life), but the lack of connection between the characters made it feel a little forced.  <br/><br/>Faith (played by my wife, Emma) was kind of the "rock" of the group.  Driving the truck, and providing a lot of the direction, it made it hard for her to foreshadow her "revenge" subplot against Vlad.  In the buildup to the final confrontation with the Witch, it all came out, about her dead brother, killed in the LA riots by the military.  The scene was more about cementing the unity of the group, with her realising that there were more important things in the face of a greater evil.<br/><br/>Vlad's "Past Allegiance", in the form of his old commander, fuelled what was probably one of the most enjoyable scenes for me.  They're passing through the Witch's slave-camp, which is guarded by paramilitary thugs.  They stop at a checkpoint, and give their cover story - they're bringing the doctor to see the Witch.  And the guy behind the checkpoint is Cole, the old commander.  "That's an interesting story" he says.  There's shocked silence, and after accusing Vlad of bailing on his unit, and of being a coward, he offers Vlad a chance to join the unit again, reformed with new members.  I could actually see indecision on Ben's face, but he chose to stick with the group, and instigated a huge firefight.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147444/#Comment_147444" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T20:55:06+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  8:55PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There were lots of other cool moments, but on the whole I felt like the game wasn't as successful as it could have been.  The situation wasn't ideal, and also I think there are some difficulties in changing the setting.  The lack of supernatural stuff made foreshadowing Dark Fates a lot harder, since you had to rely on natural causality, rather than supernatural explanations.

It'd be interesting to hear from people who have tried other TMW hacks about issues like this.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I'm going to put up my notes and the handouts I made on my site, and I might try it again sometime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147483/#Comment_147483" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T23:51:03+00:00" title="June  2, 2008 11:51PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Simon, I'm glad you took the reins to run your own hack of this game.  I've run two hacks of my own as one-shot con games, and both were great experiences for me.  One was "The Dirty Half-Dozen", which riffed off of favorite WW2 movies of mine like Where Eagles Dare and The Dirty Dozen.  And just last weekend I ran <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6644&amp;page=1#Item_4" rel="nofollow">"Heart of Darkness"</a>, which used the movie Apocalypse Now as its inspiration.<br/><br/>I totally get your points about cranky babies and unexperienced players.  But I ran both of these games in 4 hours or less.  And actually, we spent the first 45 minutes of Heart of Darkness just creating characters.  So it can be done.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>The lack of supernatural stuff made foreshadowing Dark Fates a lot harder, since you had to rely on natural causality, rather than supernatural explanations.

Both of the games I ran had almost zero supernatural content, and the games didn't seem to suffer as a result.  In both cases, I just told the players to "hand wave" the specific historical stuff and go for what they find interesting.<br/><br/>From reading your AP report, my guess as to why your game wasn't firing on all cylinders was because of the characters, not the players or the GM or the setting.  Especially for a one-shot, this game really needs a powder keg situation that is ready to explode.  Each character should have a strong opinion about the other characters in the game.  And every character needs to have some sort of scab that the other characters can pick at.<br/><br/>I've found that as a GM, you also need to be pretty aggressive when you don't have much time.  I started off with one easy scene to get everyone on the same page about mechanics, and then I threw them into the fire.  I only had one chapter the entire game, which meant that they never got to reup their Trust points during the game.<br/><br/>I also tried to bring in Bangs that would cause doubt and discord amongst the players.  A good example of this was the female Vietnamese woman calling to the soldiers over hidden radio speakers in the Heart of Darkness game.  She called upon the crew to surrender, and spoke to them directly by name.  But then one of the players realized that she left someone's name out.  And immediately the paranoid increased.<br/><br/>And it's also on the players to bring the awesome to this game.  They should be told at the very beginning that it is their responsibility to add content to the game whenever they can, whether it's a NPC or a flashback or an entire scene.<br/><br/>Once I set the game in motion as a GM, I largely try to stand back and let the characters pull themselves apart from within.  I'm just there to keep the fires burning and to step in to add structure when necessary or to focus the group when it comes to a conflict.  If the players come to the table simply expecting to be entertained, it's hard to make this game work well in my experience.<br/><br/>It looks like you had some nice moments at the table, and I hope this was helpful for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

I think if the absence of supernatural was a problem for your play, just add an element of the supernatural. What I mean is you're doing post apocalypse. I think you could describe the collapse of society as strange in a way that doesn't commit anything and leaves the causes open. I think you might also start a bit more blank slate. Hmmm... how to describe.... Have you seen the movie Casshern? It's a Japanese movie, one of the most visually interesting things I've ever seen. Anyway, there's this scene where a small group of people are making their way across a radioactive wasteland. They don't seem to know where they're going or what they'll find, but they go anyway. This is what I immediately though of on reading your description.<br/><br/>I also totally love the last one on earth bit. That's great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147816/#Comment_147816" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T19:57:17+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  7:57PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris,<br/><br/>I think you're right that the problems started with character creation.  Part of that was inexperienced players, and a less-than-ideal setup, but I think there were things I could have done to make sure we started with a more explosive situation.  I think the background questions I asked were pretty weak.  They should have been something like "what does saving this town mean to you" and "what did you lose in the apocalypse".  Thiose would have speced things up a lot.<br/><br/>I hear what you're saying about having to be aggressive in a short time frame.  The first time I ran the game (more successfully), I was much more aggressive with scenes.  While that game was good, it left me feeling a little like it was just one conflict after another, without room for the characters to develop.  I was a little more laid back in this game, pushing conflicts less, and letting scenes develop on their own.  My hope was that this would allow the characters more opportunities to develop relationships, but it didn't work out that way in play.<br/><br/>I had mixed success with the Bangs I introduced.  Some of them were really effective.  There was a scene where they were taking shelter with a woman in her house, who was waiting for her husband to come home. They had a very domestic scene in her kitchen, eating old military rations. When the husband came home, he was working for the Witch, and had orders to kill the characters.  There was a great standoff, with the characters holding the woman hostage.  I think it really showed what the characters were willing to do for the mission, and the differences in their approaches.  <br/><br/>Other Bangs were really weak.  They found a weird cult in a burnt-out city, that were about to sacrifice two captives.  The characters intervened and saved the day, but it all felt a little superfluous.<br/><br/>Clyde,<br/><br/>I'm glad you like the sound of it.  I'll post here again when the stuff is online.  I made a few pretty nice-looking handouts, which you might like to check out.  <br/><br/>I know the kind of feel you're thinking of for the end of the world.  That's really the feel I wanted as well, a kind of mythic doom having befallen the world.  It was kind of hard to communicate that in play though.  I think maybe I was rushing too much.<br/><br/>The "last on Earth" bit worked really well.  Claiming "Doctor" as an ability, for example, meant that everywhere they went, people were in desperate need of healthcare.  It mad ethe player's decisions really important, which I really liked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.
