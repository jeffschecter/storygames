The basic idea is that, due to a botched (?) summoning ritual, the Death Eaters bring someone from another dimension/reality in Harry Potter's world. This character is a low-level D&amp;D Wizard from a D&amp;D 3.5 campaign world. He's presumably played by quite a munchkin, and is extremely aware of how to take advantage of various rules, loopholes, and character builds, as well as meta-aware of concepts like what is and what isn't Plot-relevant (for example, he counts the adjectives used to describe "NPCs" to see if they are important characters or throw-away background NPCs, and anxiously leaps at anything which sounds like a "plot hook").<br/><br/>The Harry Potter universe he now finds himself in, however, is serious and internally-consistent, as in the books.<br/><br/>The result is pretty amusing, and an interesting challenge to the D&amp;D character: in some ways, he is completely useless compared to the 'native' wizards, in other ways his magic is far more powerful. (He starts creating <i>Protection from Evil</i> amulets for people to wear so they can be safe from the <i>Imperius Curse</i>, for example, which is something no HP-verse wizard can do. The local wizards can cast spells pretty much as much as they like, but he must rest and re-memorize his spells; on the other hand, they can't cast much without their wands, whereas he has no such limitations.)<br/><br/>Doing this at the table, as a live RPG, would present quite the challenge. And it might potentially be a very interesting one!<br/><br/>The story or game can be played for laughs or quite seriously (and the fanfic does both: over time, the D&amp;D character is surprised to develop human emotions and desires for friendship or love, where before all he ever chased were Experience Points and such details didn't matter).<br/><br/>How would you make this into a game? We're crossing not only two genres and two different set of narrative conventions, but presumably two different rulesets of some sort as well. How could we handle this and find ways to get some extra oomph out of this at the table?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420969/#Comment_420969" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-02T04:43:00+00:00" title="September  2, 2013  4:43AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have nothing to say about gaming this, but the fanfic is brilliant.

My take on the "D&amp;D thing" is that it's a mistake to get stuck on how to use the D&amp;D rules; it is more effective to play your chosen system pure, and allow the D&amp;D elements to inform the particulars. For example, in <i>Solar System</i> Milo's D&amp;D magic could easily be represented at varying levels of mechanical detail (Abilities, Secrets), yet without letting the mechanical constraints of D&amp;D dictate the proceedings. Something like "a D&amp;D wizard can only cast so many spells per day" would be an important fact because the players know it to be so, not because we're necessarily counting spell slots. It would be a similar clash of world views that TSoY features all the time, with two cultures having radically different tools and ideology, and in this regard as well SS would be a good choice as a system.<br/><br/>In other words, my take would be to recognize what you're actually doing e.g. genre-wise, pick a rules set that suits it, and then do that. In the case of this serial novel (a term I prefer to "fanfic", you understand, what with my lack of faith in consumerism), to me it seems like straightforward character-focused adventure drama, well suited for FATE, Solar System or other generic adventure game of your preference. Just lay down your own HP crunch and D&amp;D crunch, and let the dice fall as they may. Anything more authoritative than that (I mean the sort of auteuristic obsession with details that some GMs are prone to in planning) in attempting to capture the feel of a given literary work would be foolish. The players will do it, or not, as they will.<br/><br/>I should note that I could see "doing it" in D&amp;D as well, especially as the author seems to be an universalist sort of 3rd edition player, and 3rd edition D&amp;D is, as we know, pretty vague in terms of what it does. It would not be difficult to develop a set of HP crunch for 3rd edition, allowing you to play "both sides" in one system. Regardless, at my table doing this with D&amp;D would be a certain way to focus on the challenges instead of the dramatic concerns, which I think wouldn't do justice to the original material; I find that the most interesting elements of Milo's story are the comedy (not doable if you're genuinely optimizing for victory) and Milo's development into a human being. Also, I think that it would be a betrayal of the implicit theme in the original text to make the HP world work according to D&amp;D rules, warts and all; it comes up in the story constantly how the HP world is less superficial and more realistically human-like (in a word, a real world) than the one Milo originates in.<br/><br/>I imagine that a slightly different sort of gamer would find it unsatisfying to not rise to the challenge of "combining two rules systems" with a story like this. My only defense is that I don't really see it as two rules-systems side by side, even if you take care to attempt such; the best you could do would be to create a frankensystem, sewing two games together and causing a lot of unnecessary work. It could be interesting in a technical manner to debate the issues that would crop up constantly, but I suspect that a group's enthusiasm for the actual events in play would flag - it'd take specific game design to somehow balance the interests of rules debate and drama with satisfying pacing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420973/#Comment_420973" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-02T07:27:55+00:00" title="September  2, 2013  7:27AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I agree with you in principle: the story is largely a character-drama, and it might be best to focus on that. However, wouldn't you be missing out on a huge part of the humour by throwing out all the D&amp;D-isms altogether? (Perhaps my favourite moment is when Bellatrix -- at least I assume it's her, she's not named by the author - stuns a D&amp;D wizard and says, "You're all so predictable: you always cast your spells at precise 6 second intervals.")<br/><br/>These elements could be added in through pure roleplay, of course, but surely you would want to keep at least the XP and memorized spell concepts, to be faithful to the original story? If the D&amp;D character is identical to everyone else, how do you make these plot devices meaningful.<br/><br/>This becomes particularly important if you have several players in the game, and some are "D&amp;D-characters" while others are not. Wouldn't it be good to distinguish between them mechanically? Or did you have specific crunch ideas in place: i.e. Secrets or Abilities which mimic the desired D&amp;D elements, like increasing toughness (i.e. hit points) with experience?<br/><br/>For what it's worth, my first thought was simply to have Milo's player use the D&amp;D rules, but to handle everything else freeform. (The GM would be careful to follow precedents and adjudicate outcomes as consistently as possible, but there would be no mechanical system from his side, only from the player's.)<br/><br/>If there were other players in the game (as non-D&amp;D characters), they would use a very simply player-side system like the Pool or something a la Primetime Adventures. <br/><br/>Solar System is also an interesting idea, however, because bits and pieces of crunch (especially Keys) could be added to potential "D&amp;D characters" piecemeal, allowing them to slowly grow into their humanity.<br/><br/>Wilhelm,<br/><br/>My apologies!

What I said was that I would be systematically clear about using the D&amp;D elements in exactly the way the author of the original text uses them: they inform a creative process that is, nevertheless, being executed under an entirely different set of rules. For the author it's the rules of writing, for a game it could be whatever rules system you find suitable for developing a dramatic adventure story like this.<br/><br/>The reason for why I'd do something like this in <i>Solar System</i> is specifically that it's good for depicting not only different cultures and cosmologies, but also the interaction and friction of these against each other. In a D&amp;D / HP crossover campaign I would presumably give each "character origin" their unique set of Keys, Abilities and Secrets, depicting their different worlds. It would be cumbersome to count xp for realz as a creative technique (that is, I can sure see how a gamer would see that as appealing, but in reality I would expect it to be a wasteful use of time for what amounts to a single joke), for which reason I would instead give the D&amp;D characters a Key like "Key of XP Collecting" and let them operate that, all according to the ordinary processes of the game in play; presumably operating such a Key would provide the players more than enough opportunities for working that joke (hah hah, how funny that these D&amp;D characters gain power by fighting monsters), all without giving it a whit more attention or playtime than it deserves in the overall scheme of the campaign. And of course, if we had a particularly fussy player who derived joy from that, nothing would prevent them from doing actual XP tracking to whatever detail they felt like, shouting out totals periodically.<br/><br/>Extend that principle to whatever elements (hitpoints, combat rounds, Vancian magic) of D&amp;D you want to have featured in your campaign, and that's pretty much all there is to it; presumably, if the theme was similar to the original work, the D&amp;D characters would learn to accomodate the real world over time, which would mean adopting more and more crunch (Keys, particularly) from the other side of the fence, eventually ending up with unique personal amalgams in character builds, not purely belonging in either world.<br/><br/>Your idea about D&amp;D rules + freeform is a good one, too! Specifically, the freeform overlay would help communicate clearly that this is not "really" a D&amp;D campaign, which would presumably help players treat with the D&amp;D stuff in a properly ironic manner. It would also provide a kind of eerie arbitrariness and dramatic conceit to the "real world" elements, when they're merely narrated by the GM instead of utilizing clearly adjudicated rules - very much the same effect the original text is going for. It would need to be clear that the D&amp;D rules genuinely wouldn't have any ultimate arbitrage power, of course; the freeform system would rather relinquish appropriate elements to be resolved under D&amp;D rules.<br/><br/>(The reason for the way I phrase that about the relationship of D&amp;D and freeform is that I recognize that of course this novel is not being written under any "real" objective rules that enmesh two universes and their rules together. It could be a source of difficulties if one pretended that D&amp;D rules are actually being used as a compelling source of authority themselves, when in reality only select matters are occasionally submitted to 3rd edition rules scrutiny.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420984/#Comment_420984" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-02T09:09:06+00:00" title="September  2, 2013  9:09AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps an useful analogy for this would be to consider the 4th edition D&amp;D game. My own best understanding of the game (and I understand if others feel differently, this is just the result of my own exploration) is that it is a simulationistic enterprise with the goal of pretending that we're playing an earlier edition of D&amp;D, all for the sake of nostalgia and heroic fantasy narratives; we pretend that there are challenges and triumphs, while actually acknowledging that the rules system is intended to provide regularized dramatic arcs with plentiful D&amp;D color.<br/><br/>What I suggest about the role of D&amp;D in the novel under consideration is similar: success is achieving plentiful, amusing observations in detail about D&amp;D, all without actually playing D&amp;D, because if you actually played D&amp;D, that wouldn't be nearly as fun and dramatic.<br/><br/>(Hmm, one might ask why I wouldn't suggest using 4th edition D&amp;D for this, then. I suppose the reason is that 4th edition is very, very focused on simulating D&amp;D skirmishes, so any campaign that fundamentally doesn't care about that wouldn't be very efficient. The goals are sort of similar, but ultimately the subject matter is very different.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420988/#Comment_420988" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-02T10:01:11+00:00" title="September  2, 2013 10:01AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TSoY/SS is a great suggestion, as is FATE, but I have two others, just for variety's sake. I haven't read the fic yet.<br/><br/>1) The D&amp;D wizard is a Dungeon World Wizard, but with access to the full D&amp;D spell list*, while the rest of the characters are Monsterhearts PCs. Running HP using Monsterhearts worked well for me in the past, as well as running Monsterhearts at the same time as another AW ruleset, Monster of the Week, both at the same table. The advantages of using two AW systems together are, I think, obvious, and this particular combination would be salutary to the goal of having a dramatic game, because MH does that very well. I'd say the GM should follow the Agenda, Principles, and Moves of MH and not DW, in this case.<br/><br/>2) For maximum seriousness, Burning Wheel. The D&amp;D wizard uses either default, traditional Sorcery from the core book or Abstraction and Distillation from the Magic Burner. (There isn't quite the same issue of re-memorization, but there is Tax.) While the HP wizards use Art Magic, which is much more freeform and flexible, while ultimately not having as much access to those big flashy effects you get with things like, I don't know, Color Spray.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*Wizard is actually my least favorite class in DW, because I find the lack of a wide variety of spells annoying; easy enough to fix I suppose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421094/#Comment_421094" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T05:43:19+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  5:43AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Eh, it's no <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality" rel="nofollow">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421100/#Comment_421100" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T08:07:35+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  8:07AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, how would you play that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421104/#Comment_421104" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T08:32:29+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  8:32AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is the bomb!

I would imagine that part of the fun of this kind of game would be finding more little idiosyncracies like these: "Hey, you shouldn't try swimming under the submerged train car, because you can't hold your breath that long, but I can hold my breath for Con*6 seconds, and double it with a Willpower check, so I should be fine."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421125/#Comment_421125" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T13:07:55+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  1:07PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would develop crunch with the natural method of SS, which is basically to build up a bunch beforehand for the most interesting stuff, and then create more as need presents itself. Thus I would probably not crunch up the healing rates (not that interesting to me) in advance, but if it became pertinent, we'd pull something together. The primary way e.g. healing rates or holding your breath or the like situational tactical differences would come up would be in conflict choreography and situational modifiers: this guy gets a penalty die for this thing, while this other guy doesn't because his personal rules system is more amenable to doing it. It would be exactly the same as when a character gets special treatment for being of a different species or culture than another one, in this case it's just "rules-mechanical nativity" that causes the differences.<br/><br/>In a word, I would not take the step of treating the D&amp;D elements as any more "gamey" things than the HP setting elements are. Both merely are, and they are equivalently setting elements and not rules, and therefore they only have the capability of affecting our procedures of play insofar as settings facts may in the chosen game. A player standing upon the point that the D&amp;D rules prevent his character from drowning before N seconds have passed has exactly as strong a position as another whose setting guide indicates that his character's species can hold their breath for N seconds before drowning. I know that this is not a satisfying strategy for all (it's easy to imagine how kewl it would be to, like, play FATE and D&amp;D <i>at the same time!</i>), but my earnest presumption is that it's the strategy most likely to have an actually fun campaign on this premise. Naively smashing two systems together won't work, and actually designing two systems to perform well together is quite a bit of work - not impossible by any means, but not something I'd care to do just for the giggles.<br/><br/>Dungeon World / Monsterhearts is also an excellent suggestion, I could see that working; it's a very fair approximate half-way point between the settings, one might say, not allowing either to swallow up the other; sure the D&amp;D character won't quite exactly get effortless 100% fidelity to his mechanical conceits (although you can get pretty frigging close if you master the system), but it's not like anybody else is getting that anyway, so everybody's in the same boat, and the system has plenty of scope to adapt on mere mechanical and color details. Best of all, it's clearly a drama game that has scope to capture the themes of the source novel, just like FATE or Solar System.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421128/#Comment_421128" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T14:54:01+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  2:54PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2013 2:54PM by JDCorley.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a lot more complicated than is being suggested (by some).  The role of the DM in a D&amp;D game, especially of the sort of "creative spell use" type that the immigrant wizard character is clearly from is so different from the role of a GM in (say) a Hope Prep, Demonsgate High, Broomstix, Lashings of Ginger Beer, or other Harry Potter-esque school game that it you have to take on a considerable amount of schizophrenia to make it work.<br/><br/>I would just have the D&amp;D character's player playing D&amp;D and everyone else playing (say) FATE and the GM just randomly shift gears between responding like a D&amp;D DM and a FATE GM.  It doesn't quite work if you always respond to the D&amp;D wizard like you're playing D&amp;D, but it also doesn't work if you never respond to them that way.  <br/><br/>I can see maybe a prop that counts down a random amount of time between 5 and 20 real life minutes, and then you switch.<br/><br/>Yes, as Eero points out, this means a character might die if they think they can take a fall of X feet due to having plenty of hit points and then they splatter unmercifully because suddenly they don't and can't.  I am okay with this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421139/#Comment_421139" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T17:42:16+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  5:42PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great take on it, too, JD.

For instance, the D&amp;D-wizard casts a spell, and the HP wizard has some kind of protection which seems like it should help. We go to the meta-rule to resolve the situation, then use that ruling as a precedent going forward.<br/><br/>It could be as simple as a Die of Fate kind of thing, which the GM uses for inspiration, or as complex as a bidding process between the players (perhaps something like Polaris-style negotiation could be interesting here). It could also look something like the Apocalypse World workspace rules: a framework for decision-making which still leaves the outcome in the hands of the players (or a certain player).<br/><br/>Matt, I'd love to hear more about how you married the two rulesets in your MotW/MH game.
