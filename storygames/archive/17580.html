I also have the Revivification Folio which uses the Skulduggry rules to play Dying Earth.  Soon we will start a short campaign, I'll have some new players and some experienced players who really enjoyed tech noir.   I was curious of the experience people had with these slightly different rule sets, and if there a good reason to use one over the other?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398554/#Comment_398554" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T22:58:52+00:00" title="November 23, 2012 10:58PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I must admit, I prefer the original Dying Earth rules. It's a beautiful game. Skulduggery adds a couple of things to the main ruleset that, to me, seemed a bit superfluous. I forget what! <br/><br/>Dying Earth is, I think, best treated like a traditional roleplaying game: don't feel you need _all_ the rules. For example, I know that many people don't use Trumps.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful game. You need players who enjoy the duels of wits and will play up to that. Some of my best roleplaying experiences have been with Dying Earth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398563/#Comment_398563" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-24T05:54:29+00:00" title="November 24, 2012  5:54AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've used Skulduggery to run a few convention games and local one-shots.  I chose Skulduggery mainly to play out 'Vancian' stories in non-Dying Earth settings.  The games included space opera adventures as well as fantasy adventures.  For some reason, I found it easier to understand the Skulduggery rules compared to DERPG rules.  Perhaps this was due to the layout or format or writing style.  The rules themselves are very similar, as mentioned above.  One difference that I like is Skulduggery/Revivification Folio (RF) eliminates Health, making combat faster.<br/><br/>One clear difference between DERPG vs Skulduggery/RF is that the latter two come with pre-written scenarios and character component cards ready for assembly into complete characters.  Using the RF characters and scenarios might speed the start-up of a short campaign, especially with players who are familiar with Vance's writings--Dying Earth or other.  <br/> <br/>I actually did not want to use the Skulduggery pre-written scenarios and method of character creation--involving random selection of several character cards that together determine the characters' skills--so instead made tables from which the players could roll up characters at the start of play.  That worked well enough, although using pre-written cards would be faster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
