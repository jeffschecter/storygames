It always seemed so hard and scary, but games like Fiasco and Microscope got me comfortable with facilitating a game, and Monsterhearts just seemed a small step up from there. You still set up scenes like in Fiasco, and you just play some NPC\u2019s that are mostly fall guys to show how cool your PC\u2019s are. Plus, all the storylines are pretty much made up by your wonderful players. So easy, right? Right!<br/><br/>I convinced three players to try it with me. The only thing I prepared for the first game was a list of questions that people could use to make NPC\u2019s and relations to them. I figured that for the first session I could just riff off of what people made up, and on the second session I could start to prepare a few storylines. (If the PC\u2019s were still alive by that time, but I knew my players are not so cut-throat that they would go crazy instantly). My list of questions was:<br/><br/>- what does x do that really gets your blood boiling?<br/>- who has a secret crush on you and how do you know about it?<br/>- Who trusts you implicitly and why?<br/>- Who dumped you recently and why?<br/>- Why did x get arrested recently?<br/>- Who do you have a rivalry with and why?<br/>- Who throws the best parties and why? <br/><br/>The last one was the only answer I needed this session, since I planned to go for the standard: a day at school (or work), and then an announced party in the evening that people could work towards for a nice climax.<br/><br/>The players picked the Vampire, Werewolf and Ghoul skins (putting me one skin short of Twilight), and decided that they wanted to be in college. Explaining the game was easy, mostly due to the skins that make building your character peanuts. The players all knew Fiasco, so they were comfortable with making up relationships, though they were a bit taken aback when it turned out they had to come up with all the NPC\u2019s  <br/><br/>They did great, though, and in NPC creation they already came up with lots of stuff that was just begging to become storylines:<br/><br/>- <b>The Vampire (Morgana)</b> ruled that the Ghoul had saved her life from \u201cVampire Slayer bitches\u201d - oh yeah, those are definitely coming back!<br/>- <b>The Ghoul (Yorick) </b>ruled that Mr. Robinson the algebra teacher had a crush on him (he knows this, because he always gets straight A\u2019s and he sucks at Algebra), and spoke positively on about him on the intake exam \u201cbefore he had even met me\u201d. Hmms... That\u2019s pretty suspicious, I wonder who constructed him...<br/>- <b>The Werewolf (Levi)</b> ruled that he was created by a friendly Dryad who trusts him implicitly and vice versa. Wow, that\u2019s going to be so a thing!<br/><br/>So then we played:<br/><br/><b>Algebra class</b><br/><br/>- People get their grades back - we discuss what grades people get, but Yorick the Ghoul gets back a C instead of the A\u2019s he\u2019s accustomed to. WTH? It turns out to be a ploy by Mr. Robinson who wants him to come over to his house for tutoring. Yorick agrees.<br/>- Levi and Morgana have to work together to solve the equations. Levi has been stalking Morgana and now that he\u2019s this close he notices that she smells unlike any other human. Morgana shuts down Levi\u2019s attention but does agree to meet him tonight for dinner to work on the problems some more.<br/><br/><b>Between classes</b><br/><br/>Brad the popular guy (he who throws the best parties) invites everyone to \u2018the best party of the year\u2019 tonight. Levi lobbies to get the nerds to the class invited. Brad asks if anyone can bring drugs, \u201clike, the good stuff\u201d. Yorick the Ghoul (who feeds on Chaos) is happy to make this happen, but sadly he knows nothing about drugs. <br/><br/><b>Gym class</b><br/><br/>Gym class happens (which is weird since we\u2019re in college - out college is morphing into high school! We rule the biology teacher likes to combine theory and practice): dodgeball time! A lot of scores get settled between the PC\u2019s and NPC\u2019s. Dodgeball is just awesome.<br/><br/><b>After school</b><br/><br/>He goes online to get information but fails his '<i>gazing into the abyss</i> roll, so he gets some truly awful recipes about \u2018making drugs with household items\u2019 including bleach, washing powder and nutmeg. I rule it\u2019s a bit too complicated for him and he\u2019ll need someone who knows a thing or two about chemistry. <br/><br/><b>Enter Sebastian</b>, the new kid who has no friends. Yorick fails his manipulation roll but this storyline is getting good, so Sebastian goes along with it, but clings to cool Yorick in the most pathetic way possible - Yorick will lose a lot of cool points for this! He promises to hang out with Sebastian and come watch his model airplane collection, and even get him into the party.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Morgana the Vampire and Levi the Werewolf meet for study dinner in a diner. Levi turns out to know her favorite dish and her favorite hobbies and comes along too clingy in a lot of ways, but when he loses interest in Morgana while he focuses on the math problems, she regains interest. The waitress gives them a few drinks on the house because they are such a cute couple, all dressed up for a party. \u201cSo is this a date, then?\u201d<br/><br/>Meanwhile Yorick, the calculating Ghoul goes shopping. He buys a vibrator and a fancy model airplane. Then, he shows up at this teacher\u2019s house. While Mr. Robinson makes him a fancy espresso, he hides the vibrator in Mr. Robinson\u2019s teacher bag. Then Mr. Robinson sits him down and tries to have a \u201cHow are you really?\u201d talk with him. He makes some allusions about Yorick liking \u2018a wild time\u2019, but Yorick shuts him down. Mr. Robinson gets a condition <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blueballed</span>, Yorick gets the condition <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trouble</span>. They work through the algebra problems and at the end Yorick pretty much knows how to solve this weeks assignments. As he leaves, he passes by Mr. Robinson\u2019s bedroom and sees posters of anatomy charts hanging there... Pretty suspicious for an Algebra teacher, eh? Yorick files this for later (<i>which is great, because I don\u2019t know where this is going</i>) and leaves.<br/><br/>Morgana the Vampire and Levi the Werewolf are at the park. Levi has taken her to his dryad tree, but sadly someone has used it to take a piss against and it smells awful to him. They move to the graveyard hand in hand. Morgana hypnotises Levi to think that they shared a romantic moment, but actually just feeds on him.<br/><br/>Yorick meets with Sebastian in his dorm room. Sebastian is a bit suspicious about the inhalant drugs but he won\u2019t turn down his new bestie. He mentions that he had to check out some materials from the school chem lab for it, and put them on Yoricks name - Sebastian is sure that the teachers will be happy Yorick has taken an interest. Yorick presents Sebastian with a new fancy model airplane, and takes Sebastian to his own house to get him some cooler clothes (<i>I work very hard to make Sebastian as geeky and pathetic as possible, ecstatic at the idea of having one friend in this horrible harsh world. It's nice how you can really blow up NPCs when you GM.</i>).                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zephyr" title="zephyr"><img alt="zephyr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zephyr">zephyr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419638/#Comment_419638" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T08:02:04+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  8:02AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Party time!</b><br/><br/>Morgana and Levi arrive at the party, but Morgana doesn\u2019t want everyone to gossip about them, so she yanks her hand out of his before they get in sight. Inside, she hits the dancefloor. Levi tries to keep up with her but his dancing sucks. She attracts a fancy salsa guy who comes to twirl and dip her - he (G\xe9rard, from a year higher than them) has read a lot of Pick Up artist stuff and uses the hot-cold techniques that manage to keep Morgana\u2019s interest for a while. Levi explodes with jealously and shuts G\xe9rard down. G\xe9rard is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intimidated</span>, and Levi is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Possessive</span>. People start gossiping about them now.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Yorick starts announcing \u2018the special punch\u2019 to people, and puts the inhaler drugs right next to them. (<i>What will the special drugs do? The players hope it will trigger everyone\u2019s darkest self, but that seems a bit too easy, doesn\u2019t it? When they go dark, I kind of want it to be personal. I figure the drug just loosens inhibitions A LOT on both humans and supers. They may not go dark, but they will be inching it</i>). The crowd that rushes towards the special punch is silent for a minute as they have a \u2018whoa\u2019 moment, and then goes pretty mad into a kind of orgiastic mess of sex and violence. Time to get a bit crazy!<br/><br/>G\xe9rard comes back to grab Morgana and kiss her (and to drive Levi over the edge). He turns into his darkest self and into a man-wolf beast. He pushes G\xe9rard through the windows, jumps after him and starts mauling him. Morgana can feel the blood pulsating through the throbbing mass of students and is sorely tempted (even though she normally doesn\u2019t like \u2018easymode\u2019).<br/><br/>Yorick is ecstatic, his plan has worked out perfectly. For the final touch, he wants to go to the breakers to turn off the light. Sebastian is panicked and clings to him but Yorick pushes him away. He falls over but pathetically crawls after Yorick anyway. Yorick lazily kicks him away (even though it preys on his conscience). <br/><br/>For convenience and coolness sake, I rule that that the breakers don\u2019t quite go pitch-black but flickers in a kind of stroboscopic effect. Yorick goes into a kind of wide armed jesus pose in the middle of the house to soak in all the chaos. Sebastian clings to Morgana to protect him, and she feeds on him instead, not bothering to hide it.<br/><br/>Morgana finds him there and is attracted by his disaffected state, so she comes up behind him to seduce him. He ignores her, but Levi finds them there and is furious to see his love in this position. He jumps Yorick who flies to the air into a wall, and lies crumpled underneath there. Levi can\u2019t avoid also pushing Morgana who hits her head on a bookcase, and gets hurt. This pushes Levi out of his Darkest Self.<br/><br/>The throbbing mass of students divide them with their sex and violence. Poor Sebastian is hiding under the bar in a foetal position going \u201cit\u2019s all a dream, it\u2019s all a dream". Yorick the Ghoul decides that he\u2019s had his fill, and the fact that two people seem to have held their own in this chaos unsettles him, so he leaves the scene. Outside the house, he sees Mr. Robinson start up his car and drive away, smiling contently. Police cars drive up. Levi picks up Morgana, takes her away from the scene, and brings her home.<br/><br/>The next session is a few weeks later, at least. Brad is grounded for life and has to take a student job to pay for the damages to his parents\u2019 house. Also, Brittany broke up with him. All the other students refuse to talk about the party, and it\u2019s clear they ascribe the weird happenings to the drugs and prefer not to think too hard about it. G\xe9rard (when he finally gets out of hospital) remains petrified of Levi. Our three PC\u2019s remember it all fine, and are now painfully aware they\u2019re not the only power in town.<br/><br/>And that was it!<br/><br/><i>With three players, I was a bit worried that two would pair off too much, but it was good that the Ghoul got to show off his calculating manipulative side on a string of NPC\u2019s while the Vampire and Werewolf got to build their relationship. There\u2019s plenty of reason for them to change focus next time, and I have three origin stories to prepare (a bit) so we\u2019re certain to get one or two more sessions out of it.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419640/#Comment_419640" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T09:14:53+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  9:14AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds fantastic! <br/><br/>Some question:<br/><br/>How did you feel MCing for the first time?

(I would <i>so</i> pick up fencing with Julia Jones)<br/><br/>MC'ing felt great! I started with facilitating storygames like Pilgrims of the Flying Temple, Fiasco and Microscope, which is actually helpful. Fiasco teaches you how to frame scenes, and Microscope now to quickly play NPCs. The first session of Monsterhearts plays a lot of like these games, so it didn\u2019t feel so new. In the second session I\u2019ll have to introduce a bit of prepared plot, so that\u2019s starting to sound far more like a challenge.<br/><br/>All the way near the end I slipped and ended up telling a player how he must be feeling <i>\u201cYou\u2019ve created a lot of chaos and that feels great, but you notice that these other two people still seem in control and that bothers you a lot\u201d</i>. That would have been a better time to ask <i>\u201cHow does it make you feel, seeing that these two are resisting the chaos you\u2019ve created?\u201d</i>. In the flow it\u2019s hard to pull back sometimes to a question level.<br/><br/>I also had a fair bit of \u2018esprit-d\u2019escalier\u2019 afterwards, thinking of cool stuff that could have happened, moves I could have triggered, stuff NPC\u2019s could have come out with it. But most of it I can save for next time.<br/><br/><b>Dodgeball</b>: First I made them go through the humiliation of team picking, which two of them getting shafted in their own way. The werewolf was quite happy to settle some scores, so I let him roll Lashing out physically - he failed, so only his intent hit its target while the balls just zipped past. The Vampire put the moves on Tiffany (her rival) \u2018s boyfriend Brad by seductively tripping into his arms, but her failure meant Brad had been properly briefed and only jumped backwards as she fell. The Ghoul tried to trip people and got lectured by class paladin Ted for it. True to Monsterhearts, there was no winning team.<br/><br/><b>Vampire hypnosis</b>: Yeah, I was cautiously excited when she announced she was using it, but when she phrased her hypnosis spell \u201cfrom now on you\u2019ll be fully devoted to me...\u201d you could see the Werewolf player get really excited about the possessive/darkest self roleplay opportunities that would offer him. It was clear from the get-go that the vampire would get way more than she bargained for. I saw a lot of AP\u2019s where it did look like Vampire or Ghoul players would slip into a very competitive mentality. My players are raised on Fiasco, so they know all about the fun of setting themselves up to lose (yay!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419695/#Comment_419695" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T08:47:10+00:00" title="August  7, 2013  8:47AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool, thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419749/#Comment_419749" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T14:43:56+00:00" title="August  7, 2013  2:43PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really pleased it's going so well for you.
