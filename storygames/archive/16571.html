Currently I'm on 4 groups, children 10-16 years old, playing campaigns through the winter. It pays reasonably well.<br/><br/>Last summer I hired four GMs to help me with a summer camp for children; playing the frpg <i>Fabula</i> for a whole week, eating sound food, and hiking the woods every day too (to keep healthy and rest our heads). 30 children attended. It was a great success!<br/><br/>This summer we're doing it again; young players signing up for one whole week, two sessions a day, one hike in the woods a day. We do it for 3 weeks this summer, a new group of young players each week, and a unique scenario each week. All of the players are paying customers out to get some serious adventure! <br/><br/>All GMs get good money to do it, and a lot of fun!<br/><br/>So;<br/>- Have you done this?<br/>- Have you considered that doing it may bring new blood into rpgs?<br/>- Have you considered how wholesome this activity is for children and youths?<br/>- Do you understand how inspiring it is, to play with openminded and eager children?<br/>- If you have the skills, and the time; is anything stopping you from doing it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379326/#Comment_379326" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T15:28:02+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  3:28PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Summer camp seems an ideal situation for this, good thinking.

I do. In fact; in my game <i>Fabula</i> the character gets a hero-point for marrying, and another one for having children. But then you have to lead your boys into marriage too, you know, having to cope with females with their own will, and children that may or may not respect their fathers ... that is a great venue of play, and simulating society this way makes the game very interesting to the players, very challenging, and indeed wholesome. If done with adequate realism, it will help your players develop insights that will be of great worth to them later in life.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>4) It definitely is educational!</blockquote>Ja! These are the things on my list which are trained when role-playing:<br/><br/>- ground level mathematics<br/>- reading<br/>- writing<br/>- verbal communication<br/><br/>- empathy<br/>- social skills<br/>- political consciousness<br/>- problem solving<br/>- action, reaction and consequences (hands-on moral principles, ethics in praxis)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>5) I'd been thinking about it for a while, but it wasn't until my son was the age to get into roleplaying games that I felt confident I knew enough about what kids would like.

It is not easy to set up this thing. I've done it for some years now, but have never made it my full time occupation. It's a nice income on the side for me, playing with children after school.

"Health care" ... - are you serious?<br/><br/>Look at the list I have given on the benefits in playing rpgs. I am serious about those benefits. They are for real. They present huge benefits to the children who play rpgs under guidance of skilled grown ups, both in personal growth and in training key skills. Children taking up the mantle of GMing, leading their peers in fantastic interaction, experience those benefits in abundance. So any "health" issues should be discussed in the positive here.<br/><br/>If you know of any bad effects of role-playing; please post them here. I would be interested in discussing it.<br/><br/>But then; I have first hand experience with role-playing games, as they are and work amongst children, and do not have to take silly myths of "demon-worship" into consideration. Maybe that is different in the US? I do not know, but I wonder at the reason why you bring it up. Why should you concern yourself with how role-playing games are <i>perceived</i>? What is that perception based on? In fact we are talking about a <i>prejudice</i> against rpgs, so; which are the people upholding that prejudice in your culture? Why do they do it? <br/><br/>I believe such prejudice should be of no concern to a grown up and sensible person. Role-playing games are good for you. In some cases role-playing is the key to great personal growth. Go with that, and be positive in your communication about them.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James Jeffers</cite>There was another thread a long time ago on SG featuring someone who also ran games for money. Are you the same person as that, ThomasHVM?</blockquote>I believe I have mentioned this before, yes, on request by some who found a comment of mine intriguing. This time I posted out of sheer joy; I'm starting to look forward to the summer-camps, and had to share my enthusiasm.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>They PAY you to be a GM?</blockquote>Ja, of course!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>Speaking as a guy who can't keep a job for more than a year-and-a-half, I may cry.</blockquote>Cry man, cry! You must be, like me, a man crippled by how fate has dealt your cards. I can only say; play the hand you have. So did I, and it's going reasonably nice now. Calm down, fill yourself with love, and aim for joy!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>What kind of qualifications do you need?</blockquote>You need to be a good GM, and you need to present your product in a positive manner. I'm a good GM, and reasonably good at presenting my product.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>RPGs are kind of loathed here in the US. Most people look down on the activity.</blockquote>Then you should not. Look up on the imaginative interactivity of it. The interactivity of role-playing games is something a lot of artists have great difficulties creating, by the simple reason they do not know of rpgs. Make it what it is; a great way to use yourself in cooperation with other people! \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>There is one, huge, thing that may stop me from being a paid GM: initial capital and interest in the activity.<br/>In the US, Games are considered a "zero-interest" activity, meaning investors are nervous about committing to such an idea.</blockquote>It is the same in Norway. I do not get any support in doing this.<br/><br/>My initial investment in this scheme lay back in 1995, when I paid for leaflets to be distributed to local schools. It cost me approximately 200 bucks. Since then I've had around 1.700 $ in average yearly income from GMing (a conservative estimate, mind you).<br/><br/><b>FRPG Fabula</b><br/>Mind you; I believe you have to use a great game to succeed. Most classical games I know of would fall through in the special circumstances that applies in professional GMing, especially with regard to the time-constraints.<br/><br/>My fantasy-rpg <i>Fabula</i> is perfectly suited to run small sessions of 2-2,5 hours, with a speedy resolution system that allows for lots of action in that time, and with balance and robustness built in, to tackle any strange ways our game-play chooses to take us.<br/><br/><i>Fabula</i> was developed specifically for this use, by me, and went through a new revision after each half-year the first four years. I had to hone it to the purpose, and to be sternly critical about every aspect of the game, to get where I wanted with it. When it was published in 1999, it was in its eight edition. And the game I play today, is far better still. <br/><br/>As the years have gone by, I have made a myriad of settings for the game, to make the game new to me each year, so I would not grow bored with playing. The freshness and variety in themes have made players follow me for up to 11 years (some boys started at age 9, and left me at age 19), getting great fun each and every season.<br/><br/>So there is a lot of work put into this, more work than the yearly salary can cover. But rpgs are my hobby too, so I'm not complaining. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James Jeffers</cite>I think the fact you get paid to do this is wonderful.</blockquote>Ja, it really is! Most of the time it feels wonderful to play with kids! They are engaged and enthusiastic, and fall for every trick in the book! And I get paid to do it!!!

You don't need to sell me on the virtues of gaming for kids. I can run stuff at the store because our business insurance covers any potential problems with attendees. Keep in mind also that in the USA, the states function more like independent countries in the EU than you're probably used to. There's 50 different sets of rules and regulations regarding how you deal with situations where you're overseeing an activity that involves minors.<br/><br/>And yeah, gaming is not so much viewed with suspicion or distrust as it is just not really well-known or understood by the broader culture. Kids in the US tend to spend their summer doing sports, and gaming for better or worse still tends to be viewed as a thing that's for nerds, and not to be actively cultivated if you want your kids to be a success, though we've made SOME progress on that front in the last decade or so.<br/><br/>But you never answered my main question: are you doing this for a living, or as a supplement to a 'regular' job, for additional income? That's why I brought up health care: the lack of it precludes a whole lot of job options for Americans that might pay them a wage they could live with if it weren't for the YOYO approach we take to health. It's one of the main issues when we talk about why US designers can't quite their day jobs to work full-time on games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_379694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379694/#Comment_379694" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T17:27:32+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  5:27PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As said, Jim; GMing is a nice income on the side for me.

My average yearly income from each source is in the same range as Tomas's, but the pay-per-hour is much better in working with kids. Calculating how much I make on an hourly basis even when writing for Wizards, the best-paying gig out there, does not bear thinking about. (Self-publishing may, of course, be more lucrative but also makes it harder to calculate all the time you put into it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, Becky Thomas of the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.roleplay-workshop.com/" rel="nofollow">Roleplay Workshop</a> has been doing RPG afterschool and summer camp stuff, and I believe a group of adults as well, as her full-time living for decades now in the US. Last I talked to her she was using a game store as her physical space, which addresses some of the issues you mention, Jim. My afterschool program is likewise run out of a school, and as a parent who pays for my son to attend similar classes I can attest that they take the majority of the program's income in exchange for providing space, liability insurance, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecky started as a teacher, I got my start as a parent, so both of us had an "in" with a school system. One could get started by offering services to home school families, which are a lot less regulated; you could even run the games over videoconference to avoid much of the liability. Also the Brooklyn Strategist hires professional GMs, which could be a good way to get started. Starting a business like the B-Strat is like starting a game store, maybe even more risky and capital-intensive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_379715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379715/#Comment_379715" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T23:32:40+00:00" title="May 24, 2012 11:32PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very good post, Tavis!

The most I have done is 20+ hours a week; eight groups professionally, and one or two free groups on the side. That took its toll on me. I did it for one whole year, but had to cut back the next year, not to burn out. My normal rate has been 4-6 groups, 10-15 hours a week. This year I've been doing 4 groups, 10 hours.<br/><br/>In summer-camp though, we played 40 hours last year, in one week, with 5 leaders and 30 players. It was great!<br/><br/>This year we will spend more time hiking (the woods are great here), and cut-back on playing time to 5 hours a'day. I believe that will be healthy for children and adults, and still give us the time to produce really hilarious adventures.<br/><br/>As for personal preferences; I like to play, and I like children, so for me this is a great job.
