                    Say you have game of students at a university that can only hold back the encroaching madness of Cthulhu by weaving protection spells into debate. It has broad skill groups that everyone gets to take a priority ranking on:<br/><br/><code><br/>Skill                      -   Rank<br/>Research                    A<br/>Elocution                    B<br/>Improvisation             C<br/>Charisma                   D<br/></code><br/>The above character is better at Research than Elocution, which is better than Improvisation, etc. These ranks are solid numbers, say A = 4, B = 3, and so on. These numbers would indicate something like number of dice to roll or cards to pull.<br/><br/>But! During each story arc/session, you could narrate whatever you wanted, given social contract, by spending a point from the category. You would use the new total for further tests in that arc, but they would be reset each time. However, when you spent that point, you would gain a trait based off of the narration you delivered, and it would give a bonus from there on out when appropriate.<br/><br/>Did I steal this without realizing it? (Like I did with Crispin Glover?)<br/><br/>I don't know if my other question will make sense, but:<br/><br/>What kind of response would this provoke? As a player, what tactics would you see played out?                </div>

                            I'd immediately start throwing points out of each category to rack up bonuses for later.  Perhaps a limit to how many different traits you can create to prevent run away character sheet bloat?                        </div>

<p>I'm with Josh.  Each of those resets is a pile of new resources for players, but only to the extent that they've spent their old resources.  Optimal strategy is to spend <em>the very last dollop</em> of your attributes in the last moment before the reset ... unless there's some long-term benefit to success within a story-arc, such that there's resource value to keeping your attributes elevated, rather than taking the risk of lowering them.</p>

                            What if the attributes went away at the same time as the reset?<br/>What if the reset were abolished?<br/>What if there was a guaranteed harder-thing-to-do at the end of every arc (sealing a cthulhu-oid ending each arc, for instance)?<br/><br/>By the way, thanks for your help!                        </div>
