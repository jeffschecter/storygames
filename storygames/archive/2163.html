                    I've been watching <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kino%27s_Journey" rel="nofollow">Kino's Journey</a> which is a cool little anime about a girl who travels a fictional countryside with her talking motorcycle.  The pattern of the stories is that she rolls into a location and stays three days ... no more, no less.  During that time the story of the inhabitants unfolds around her.  Sometimes she takes action, sometimes she doesn't, but if she does take action then it's usually something pretty minor ... prodding someone who needs strength into realizing their dream, or putting a bullet in the head of someone who hugely deserves it.  Judging.<br/>
<br/>
So here's the thing:  I got to imagining what it would be like to play an RPG that simulated this genre, and it's wierd.  Kino never has conflicts with <i>the world</i>.  Kino is a traveller.  She understands the road.  It's <i>people</i> that don't behave the way she expects.  And the people almost <b>always</b> have conflicts with the world.  They aren't travellers.  They don't understand the world they inhabit.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that the right distribution of roles in such a game would be that whoever plays Kino also adjudicates all outcomes.  Reality always works as Kino expects it to.  But the people <i>not</i> playing Kino should have all of the NPCs, frame all of the scenes and introduce all of the conflicts.  People never work as Kino expects them to.<br/>
<br/>
I think that'd be a sort of cool way to play a game.  I may well write up some rough rules and give it a try.                </div>

                            Tony, I don't think that Kino is a protagonist. Much like Enma Ai in <i>Jigoku Shoujo</i>, she's a framing device, a point-of-view who stands in for the viewer as the stories of each episode unfurl. So yeah, she's the GM. But the protagonists are changing from story to story.                        </div>

                            It rings a completely false note with me to differentiate between having a conflict with the world and conflict with people, unless we're talking about the very limited situation of natural disasters. I'm double surprised you didn't notice the parallels with DitV. It could be a one-player game.                        </div>

                            I think that, <i>in this particular story</i>, there is a distinction to be drawn between having a conflict with the world and a conflict with ... well, let's say <i>individuals</i>.<br/>
<br/>
The anime simply treats individual people, who get face-time and lines, differently than it treats nameless masses of people and how they act.  Kino can never quite predict what an individual is thinking, or what they'll do.  But she is never surprised by what masses of people do.<br/>
<br/>
And DitV?  Uh ... not really.  Kino has no responsibility to these people.  As Mark says, she's a framing device.  But she's also an agent within the story, <i>particularly</i> in terms of the way that the people she meets end up thinking of themselves.  They come to her for judgment, but not to <i>change things</i>.  They want to know whether their course is right or wrong, but they're going to follow it either way, even knowing.<br/>
<br/>
It's ... it's an odd story form.                        </div>

<p>I'm not sure what the use of the term GM nets you here. It's familiar, but it's wrong - none of the player roles you describe map to the antique player roles in an important or useful way.</p>

                            GM is not the term you want. This game has 1 PC and multiple "GM"s. (Shreyas hates those terms, but they're a shorthand gamers and game designers build with). And from what you describe, Kino isn't a GM either. I think she's mostly passive, and a GM is primarily NOT (in the common usage)<br><br>The whole concept of GM as protagonist is also wrong, i believe. The protagonist is most often the star and focus of the show. It's okay for there to be one star/focal character, but GM is the wrong word. The game master... the one who masters the game and pulls strings behind the curtain, is not the star of the show (unless there's something very meta going on).<br><br>Game structure of one live character, and multiple "puppet" characters is something that's definitely being explored. I have a very limited knowledge of published games, so maybe there are some that act this way. Personally, I've started one or two games with that structure, and I've read early thoughts for at least one more.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            So in this game I'm writing like an ororobous, there are things called Icons.<br><br>Icons are elements of the fictional world, usually people but they can also be other things.  But Icons aren't characters (there are also characters in the game, and they're handled differently).  They are literally tools for the player to manipulate and observe the fictional world with.

<blockquote><cite>JDCorley</cite>You think your average group of Dogs has any responsibility to the towns they come to? Hells no, they don't. They're a framing device for the issues of the town.</blockquote>
Every dog has one mandatory trait/relationship - some variation on "I'm a Dog". This is not an accident. While it is formally true that there's no responsibility inherent, the fictional role "Dog" is significantly defined by the responsibilities/powers of the office. One of those responsibilities/powers is to JUDGE the townsfolk.<br/><br/>Kino's equivalent would have the mandatory role "I'm a traveler" role - which is more likely to be a simple witness than a judge, and is in part defined by its ability to move on at the end of the story, perhaps <i>learning</i> from what has been witnessed, but not necessarily <i>intervening</i>.<br/><br/>The Kino game I envision has one continuing character, created collaboratively and controlled principally through mechanics, and a changing constellation of roles played by the players, whose iteration of "town stories" alters the Traveler's character sheet until the Traveler's central issue is resolved.<br/><br/>The Traveler character is the center around which the player characters orbit.                        </div>
