I think it's a priceless historical document, giving us a first-hand perspective and analysis of what "old school" gaming was actually like.<br/><br/>Why is a D&amp;D writer getting articles in Psychology Today? Because he's also a practicing physician and associate professor of neurology.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14957979/ConfessionsOfADungeonMaster1980.pdf" rel="nofollow">Confessions of a Dungeon Master</a></b><br/><br/>I read it back when it came out in 1980.

Clearly you're someone or a type of someone I've never met?<br><br>I play D&amp;D with my friends. We've all had sex, some of us with each other. Sometimes we joke about sex or racism. Sometimes we tease one another. Teasing is a way that we communicate affection to each other. <br><br>No one is 'pressured' into anything. All of us are degree holding mature adults, who know what an appropriate boundary is and we speak up if someone is breaking that boundary. <br><br>Sometimes we play characters that do awesome things, like try to seduce player characters, run around drunk and get into trouble, and sneak off when they are invisible. <br><br>An example: One of our girls in one situation sacrificed a village child, so she could get a nice wand for her demon mentor. The mother of that child in game then put up a notice on the bulletin board that her child had gone missing, and the very next week the party (who did not know about the sacrifice, being that it was done over e-mail) was surprised to discover that the killer was one of them! (<a href="http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/2010/10/session-twelve.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/2010/10/session-twelve.html</a>)<br><br>Highly entertaining play.<br><br>Do you not have sex or sexual tension? You don't play games with people you fuck or would like to fuck? Is sexual tension not a healthy component of your life? Do the women in your life not like sex, or being pursued? Most women I've met, when I say "Oh, yeah, my character is totally going to try to fuck you." think it's cute or hot to be perused. <br><br/>I should note that because I do this, does not mean I'm a creep or in total creep mode. We have per-existing healthy relationships built on respect, openness, and good communication, which is sort of my default stance with everyone in my life (and therefore a per-requisite for gaming with someone).<br/><br/>I want the characters to not be perfect. I want them to be interesting, aggressive, and get into shticks. His game sounds awesome and a lot like mine. What I don't understand (and the point of this post which I wouldn't make except for my impression that storygames is one of the more mature boards) is what are the social norms at your table? <br/><br/>My assumption of your norms is that you shouldn't do anything that anyone else might dislike because the players may not be comfortable or have enough social skills to assertively communicate how they feel about that interaction? And I'm assuming that you don't play with any women (I usually have 4 to 5 players, with 2 or 3 girls, currently 4 players, 2 girls). Is it in a public area, thus limiting the topics you can discuss aloud?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360970/#Comment_360970" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T21:09:39+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  9:09PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: valis</cite> I'm a creep in total creep mode. </blockquote>\nCase in point. <br/>Clearly, my opinions are so suspect that my sex life needs to be put up for examination. <br/>Vally my friend, I promise my character will grab your character's boob/balls every time we play together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360971/#Comment_360971" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T21:13:14+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  9:13PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This place is weird.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/valis" title="valis"><img alt="valis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/valis">valis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360972/#Comment_360972" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T21:21:16+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  9:21PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2012 2:47AM by valis.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite><cite>Posted By: valis</cite>I'm a creep in total creep mode.</blockquote>\nCase in point.<br/>Clearly, my opinions are so suspect that my sex life needs to be put up for examination.<br/>Vally my friend, I promise my character will grab your character's boob/balls every time we play together.<br/><br/>Well, I was genuinely curious. <br/><br/>Your response is enlightening;

The fact that these parallel stuff going on in real life is perhaps unfortunate, but not automatically badwrongfun: when players know each other, this stuff is nothing to blink at. If it keeps causing trouble, then it's a problem. If it doesn't, it's life.<br/><br/>(2) The players involved have come up with different ideas of what might have gone down. This also pretty clearly says that the seductions weren't played out in detail or foregrounded -- which is the time when they can also more easily go bad or cross boundaries. Not that playing out seductions is badwrongfun either, but perhaps a bit tricky if it's an older GM running a game for teenagers...<br/><br/>(3) Just what went down turns out to matter, and matter now.<br/><br/>(4) She says there's a 25% chance they had sex. Holmes goes with that.<br/><br/>If there's something I'd point at and complain about it is the Holme's phrasing of "being talked into it". Had he said "What do you think are the chances she did it?"

If it had happened to Me As Adult right about now... well, it just wouldn't happen with the people I roleplay with regularly - we play out character relationships pretty often, but trying to assert that a seduction happened in the past with a dice roll?  It just wouldn't happen.  If you want to seduce someone, in game or out, then actually seduce them and give them a chance to negotiate it.  If it happened at a convention, with someone I didn't know so well, I'd either be speaking up straight away or walking out of the game or just not roleplaying with them again, depending on the vibe of the group and the expectations I'd had when the game started.<br/><br/>How Cicely felt about it, 22 years ago?  No idea.  She might have experienced it as a form of flirting with a guy she felt comfortable with; she might have felt creeped out or coerced in a way that Holmes observing from a position of privilege didn't notice.  I just have no idea.  Since then, there's been an entire wave of feminist theory, and two big waves of roleplaying innovations, and Holmes' account is like looking at a time capsule.  If nothing else, did you guys note the crack about whether Cicely in real life made her saving throw.  That kind of joke in a psychology journal?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: valis</cite>We have per-existing healthy relationships built on respect, openness, and good communication, which is sort of my default stance with everyone in my life (and therefore a per-requisite for gaming with someone).....<br/>My assumption of your norms is that you shouldn't do anything that anyone else might dislike because the players may not be comfortable or have enough social skills to assertively communicate how they feel about that interaction? And I'm assuming that you don't play with any women (I usually have 4 to 5 players, with 2 or 3 girls, currently 4 players, 2 girls).</blockquote>\nIt sounds like your group has negotiated its boundaries about where its comfortable roleplaying, and that's great.  But, y'know, it's pretty easy to find internet accounts of sexual hazing that's targeted at female players in roleplaying groups, particularly when they're teenagers, and particularly when they're interacting with teenage boys.

While it's definitely true that people can end up playing in uncomfortable situations and feel forced to continue, there's no real evidence of that here. It may have been the case, but we weren't there, and I have no particular reason to assume the worst.<br/><br/>Obviously the <i>boyfriend</i> is acting a dick in saying "I think we had sex" when she had just said her character is a virgin.<br/><br/>So how do you think Holmes <b><i>should</i></b> have handled it? (Assuming he has to hand all the tools an modern older dirty-hippie story gamer running an old-school D&amp;D game for teenagers focused on wish-fulfillment and oddball hijinks has. ...let's not try to guess which innovations he might have had access to or not.)<br/><br/>The options I can see all seem inferior to the one he picked:<br/><br/>- Ask Cicely to decide. Talk about being put on the spot! This doesn't sound like a good one to me at all.<br/><br/>- Ask them to negotiate it, now. Same thing, again. This is where pressure can be applied.<br/><br/>- Play a flashback scene to determine what happened. Same thing, plus it interrupts the game severely. Focus was on the unicorn, now it's not. Others are going to feel voyeuristic, since they explicitly know the purpose of the scene is to determine if sex happened or not. Yuck.<br/><br/>- Make it a fiat. "You did/didn't." Complete loss of agency. Even worse. At least with dice it's impartial and you had a chance to say how likely it seemed.<br/><br/>- Make it a fiat againt the boy. "You couldn't get it up." ...serves him right for being a dick, but not what I would recommend either, as it removes agency from <i>both</i> Cecily and him -- and humiliation is never good.<br/><br/>- Say that since it hadn't been established at the time, it didn't happen. This has possibilities, but also removes a whole bunch of veils. Earlier the players might have been comfortable with their characters going for romantic walks and whatnot -- and now the GM is saying that they need to let the others know if they start having sex. Um. No thanks.<br/><br/>...ok, now that I've written that I *can* see two options that could have worked fine:<br/><br/>(1) "It doesn't matter if you said yes or no, you would not have had the privacy to do anything." Fine, though considering the ingenuity of horny teenagers I call this patently unrealistic. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  ...but it would have flown unless the opportunity had been clearly established.<br/><br/>(2) The second the boyfriend pipes up with his "wait a minute" crap, shut him up with: "I think she knows if she's a virgin or not." This might have worked fine, but it is a putdown, and also a question of established procedures of play: they might not have had explicit rules about this, but they sure as hell had a praxis. Would Holmes have been out of line to squash the comment? Or would it have been inside his purview? (I also get the impression that Holmes isn't acting as any kind of authority -- aside from what happens in the game world -- but keeping out of the way, not acting as the chastising adult.)<br/><br/>Still, as on the spot-rulings go, going to the dice on the odds she gave? Fine.<br/><br/>Really. Put yourself in Holmes' shoes, and ask what you would have done. (If your answer is that you would never have run a game like that, fair enough.)<br/><br/>EDIT:\n<blockquote>If nothing else, did you guys note the crack about whether Cicely in real life made her saving throw.

Eric Holmes</cite>In order for the game to provide vicarious release for unacceptable behavior, the entire group of players must go along with the convention that game roles are independent of the actual players.</blockquote>\nThe second half of that sentence is a pretty obvious part of playing role-playing games, but the first half makes it clear that Holmes is very interested in the differences between real-life behaviour and the way people act when they can create "alter egos" in his game world.<br><br>Essentially, he's saying he introduces the players to a fictional setting, and allows the players' characters to do whatever they want them to.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong, Zak, but I believe this is what you would call "a feature, not a bug." And frankly, any debate over whether this kind of game is "good" or "bad" is meaningless. If that's the game everybody wants to play, that's what matters. However, we can start to see a problem here:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Eric Holmes</cite>During a lull in the action, I am apt to receive several notes from those present: "My thief is going to pick the paladin's pocket." "My magic-user is casting a Detect Magic on the staff the gnome just found." "My dwarf is going to slip some of the unknown potion into the elf's canteen." While I do have difficulty, sometimes, deciding (and remembering) who did what to whom, the players never erupt into bloodshed. The characters do, rather frequently.</blockquote>\nAgain, if this is the game everybody agreed to play, cool beans. Some people like this kind of game. Sometimes I like playing this game. Nothing wrong with that, unless there's somebody playing who doesn't want to play that kind of game. And right before that paragraph, we have this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Eric Holmes</cite>One teenager, who rarely complains, objected with untoward violence when his centaur character was robbed and abused by a character of his stepbrother's. "It's the magic-user who did that to you," protested the other lad; "I didn't do it, he did. He's a thoroughly despicable person!"</blockquote>\nHere we have not only one player who doesn't want to play this back-stabby game, we have another player using the "it's what my character would do" defense. This is a pretty old issue for some people, and maybe Luke can provide some links, as he's railed against it enough times. It's an incredibly poor excuse for making a game experience shitty for someone else. It's a manipulative tool for avoiding any discussion about other peoples' dissatisfaction with a game. If everybody is on board with playing that kind of game, you never have to say this.<br/><br/>I'll also note that these are players from the group of kids Holmes says he has been running D&amp;D for since they were quite young. He is an authority figure for these kids, both as an adult and as the DM. But instead of mentioning any sort of negotiation with the players to see what kind of game they might like to play, instead of seeing whether this one player might be tired of constantly being fucked over by the other players, instead he revels in this sort of disagreement. He's deliberately giving his players a venue for "acting out" and allowing them to engage in behaviour they know is socially unacceptable, whether or not the other players are on board with this kind of game or not. Whether he makes this clear up front, or whether new players have to discover this in play is unclear, although I suspect the latter.<br/><br/>So that's the first red flag. Granted, this is 1980 and there's not a whole lot of variety in game styles, like there is today. At this point in time, there's really only one play style for Holmes to present as an option to players, and it's heavily influenced by the competitive nature and "tough guy" stance in wargames. Even so, he represents himself as putting no effort whatsoever into accommodating the game to any of his players' preferences.<br/><br/>And, I should point out I'm not particularly concerned with what really happened. Obviously, we don't know very much about what happened, since we have only Holmes' rather truncated anecdotes to work with. It's the way Holmes represents himself and his game that I'm taking issue with.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361492/#Comment_361492" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-22T19:14:10+00:00" title="February 22, 2012  7:14PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And yeah, fine, I'll tackle the sexual content in this article.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Eric Holmes</cite>"My Naga is a virgin, of course," said one player.<br/>"Now wait a minute," said one of the males, "remember my magic-user has been trying to seduce her for the past three games. I think there's a good chance he may have done it."<br/>There was a minute pause. Everyone knew that the same tension existed between the young couple at the table that now made itself felt between the two imaginary personages in the magical garden.<br/>"Do you think that's possible, Cicely?" I asked.<br/>"I think she'd refuse."<br/>"What do you think the chances are that she got talked into it?" I asked.<br/>"Fifty percent," said the young suitor.<br/>"Twenty-five," said Cicely.</blockquote>\nSo first we have a player declaring her character is a virgin, so she can attempt to take a unicorn. Then we have another player essentially back-stabbing her character, in keeping with the behaviours I noted in my last post. And he essentially does this because he wants to bone her in real life.<br/><br/>Let's take a detour here. In this article, Holmes doesn't really give a shit what the characters are doing. This article is about the behaviours of the players. At the beginning of the article, he seems concerned with the way player and character (or "alter ego") behaviours are so different. When he moves on to sexuality in his game, he's discussing the ways in which real-life stuff makes its way into the game. He maybe could have done this when the one player is protesting being back-stabbed by his step-brother. Are these in-game rivalries reflective of real-life bullying? But no, Holmes goes for the salacious details.<br/><br/>Now, obviously Holmes can't mention this in the Psychology Today of 1980, but if we're talking strictly about characters here, he's declaring that there's a 25 per cent chance of this Naga* character getting fucked in her snake pussy. That's pretty weird. Certainly weirder than one player hitting on another in the game. Maybe it's not "creepier," being fictional (or maybe you think it is creepier, I dunno, but that kinda has to reflect on the players to, doesn't it?), but it's certainly weirder.<br/><br/>*(As another aside, I thought nagas were giant snakes with the faces of women, like the golden-faced naga from an early Conan comic. A google image search keeps bringing up pictures of the Marrilith demon, though, so maybe that's what they were thinking of in Holmes' games. Still, both of those have snake pussies.)<br/><br/>But that's not the issue here. Holmes is concerned only with player behaviour. So let's go back to that. This male player says his character has been trying to seduce this Naga for the three previous sessions. Did he just make this up now? If so, that's a bit of a dick move. If not, if he's been role-playing or describing advances for these three previous sessions, then she said "no" to him for three previous sessions. and she did it again by declaring her character a virgin.<br/><br/>After Holmes gets involved in this exchange, she says "no" again, by saying "I think she'd refuse." But Holmes doesn't let it go. He wants a percentage chance from her, and the male player won't even give her a chance to respond before he's pushing a number on her.<br/><br/>So yeah, we don't know what really happened. We don't know how she felt about it. But there's a fuck of a lot of red flags in there, and simply ignoring them is gonna make you look like a creep, much like Holmes makes himself look like a creep.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Eric Holmes</cite>And what about the young lady and her suitors? Did Cicely, like her Naga, also make her saving throw? I'm too chivalrous to ask, but I think I know the answer.<br/>The dice never lie.</blockquote>\nOh, you're too chivalrous to ask, but you're not too chivalrous to publish this shit in a magazine? I know Stephanie called this a joke, but I can't even call it that. This is straight-up unsubstantiated gossip, with little or no analysis as to why this is actually a matter of academic interest.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Eric Holmes</cite>When Grog went into action, several of the rest of us turned to her. "That's Grog," we explained. "You've probably never seen Grog before."<br/>"Oh yes," she corrected us sweetly. "I think I've been in bed with Grog several times."</blockquote>\nJohn Eric Holmes, you a gossipy muthafuckah! Yes you are!<br/><br/>Not that I'm particularly surprised. I've seen this kind of attitude before in academia, primarily in Classics, actually. Not that I'm condemning an interest in salacious details, mind you, but using academia as an excuse to spread salacious gossip is a bit like school in the summer: no class.<br/><br/>And that's not what I want representing me, or my hobby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361493/#Comment_361493" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-22T19:18:49+00:00" title="February 22, 2012  7:18PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2012 7:20PM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Holmes presents <i>one person </i>complaining <i>once</i> about a centaur and this somehow lends credence to the theory that Holmes is regularly running a game that many people at the table don't want to be involved in and being a total jackass to this female player while doing it to boot?<br/>\n<br/>\nA.

Character vs. character activity and other socially-unacceptable-in-real-life behaviour in the game is great and you don't need to discuss it with players, even when they complain about it.<br/><br/>2. It's also great when sexual agendas are played out in the game, and you don't need to discuss whether anyone is comfortable with this or not.<br/><br/>It's the blatant lack of any sort of discussion between himself and the players about the game that I think is a bad message to send out. So yes, I am going to "take that out on Holmes."

How is this different from assuming he didn't turn on the lights or let his players eat?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Every time a Carcosa game gets talked about and the blogger doesn't explicitly say "I checked to make sure these adult themes were acceptable to my players before beginning" do you assume they didn't and think "Gee that guy probably just committed a felony"?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Why make conjectures? What do we get?<br/>\n<br/>\n4. So Holmes presents one person complaining once about a centaur and this somehow lends credence to the theory that Holmes is regularly running a game that many people at the table don't want to be involved in and being a total jackass to this female player while doing it to boot?<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Why would you (or anyone) assume that he was playing a style of game his players did not want to play?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that all this may be so obvious to you that you don't think you need to answer--or you may think you have already answered, but I don't get it and am asking specific questions and would benefit greatly if specific answers are given.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnswer those questions, then accuse me of not wanting to communicate.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr ask one of your own and then see if I don't answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[history of gaming] Confessions of a Dungeon Master - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15862/history-of-gaming-confessions-of-a-dungeon-master/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[history of gaming] Confessions of a Dungeon Master - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15862/history-of-gaming-confessions-of-a-dungeon-master/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Nah.

What people call "red flags" are really ways that this resembles experiences they now view as problematic.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>The two issues represented in this article that I have a problem with are:<br/><br/>1. Character vs. character activity and other socially-unacceptable-in-real-life behaviour in the game is great and you don't need to discuss it with players, even when they complain about it.<br/><br/>2. It's also great when sexual agendas are played out in the game, and you don't need to discuss whether anyone is comfortable with this or not.<br/><br/>It's the blatant lack of any sort of discussion between himself and the players about the game that I think is a bad message to send out. So yes, I am going to "take that out on Holmes." He's the one who wrote the article.</blockquote>\nI read the article.  (One note: Psychology Today is not a psychology journal - it is a magazine for a non-psychologist audience about popular psychology-related topics.)  My thoughts on this are:<br/><br/>Regarding <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, I don't think that saying a character is seduced necessarily requires an explicit meta-game discussion of exactly what people's lines are.  It is perfectly viable to rely on social skills to see if a players is annoyed or disturbed by this, and make it open for players to speak up.  I've had plenty of games that have had lots of flirting and/or seductions without ever sitting down and having such an explicit talk.  The same applies to life outside of gaming.  I don't think that it necessarily requires a discussion beforehand to tell a dirty joke or to flirt with someone in a non-gaming situation, particularly when you are among people you know.  Now, I have certainly seem among gamers some who lack social skills and make people uncomfortable - but I don't extend that to mean that flirting at a game is a "red flag".  <br/><br/>Regarding <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, again, I have run and played in tons of games where characters lie, cheat, pillage, and even kill without having explicit discussion about how such behavior isn't socially acceptable in real-life.  While there are a few rare players who have issues with reality, they aren't a significant concern to me.  If anything, I am looking to bring more of this back into my games.  I am quite fond of many games - such as Paranoia, Fiasco, and Hellcats &amp; Hockeysticks - where anti-social behavior is expected.  I think that treating the game and in-game actions as not being real can be quite normal and healthy as a standard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361544/#Comment_361544" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-22T23:58:02+00:00" title="February 22, 2012 11:58PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2012 11:58PM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ............"This might be obvious, but as usual, I think people's reactions will tend to have to do with their own experiences with such early games - as well as how they view those games of their youth now.

Sex hasn't actually ever come up in my D&amp;D, because we're generally out to save the world, not fuck the nagas. If the bags had been an NPC, this situation actually wouldn't bug me. However, this is the worst kind of EM trapping upon player agency that I can imagine. Whether Holmes recognized the significance of taking away his player's right to her character's virginity is another matter, but I don't think it necessarily makes him less culpable. There were lots of white people demeaning and otherwise abusingblack people in the USA before the civil rights movement began (not that there seen't today, unfortunately), but it doesn't excuse those people's actions for me to say "oh well they didn't know any better, those were different times," does it? <br><br>If I don't get to decide whom my character has sex with, that's tantamount to virtual sexual assault through coercion. I wouldn't be a part of any game that included that. again, I think a key part of this is that this character was not a faceless NPC but a player character solely authored by a person sitting with you at the table. <br><br>If the DM had said, "right, so we're at a tavern, who's drinking?" And I said that my character was an ascetic who'd vowed never to imbibe alcohol, and someone said, "no. remember how I've been trying to get your character to drink for the last three games? You might drink." then I look to the EM to shut this clown up and let me play my ascetic. how I want, who among us wouldn't balk if he replied with, "ok, so what's the percent chance you change your mind about your established beliefs and just slug back a beer?"<br><br>What would it take to bother you?

And I've played with a variety of genders (and transgenders, and queers, and sexually liberated folk) over the years. The account in Holmes' article is exactly how it happens. Uncomfortable pushing about sexual situations (you're the girl, why don't you just flash them your tits as a distraction? I'm totally seducing your character right now cause that's the only way I'm interested in interacting with a girl at the table. I'm pretty sure our characters have had sex at some point, even though you're saying you're a virgin) come up all the time. Actual accounts from women gamers should kinda be enough to show that yea, this kind of pushing is a thing that happens.<br/><br/>I think it would be a different story if she laughed and said, yea, you're probably right, my character's a total slut. She's totally slept with you. So, who's gonna capture that unicorn then? But there was insistent refusal on her part, and then even negotiation in an attempt to save her character from being seduced.

It's possible that it was just fine and dandy. But then why not talk about that? There's no particular mention of how much fun it was or how much the players enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Regardless, like Jason above, I do find it very odd that the transcript we're given *does* mention the girl refusing *twice* first, *before* the other two players (the would-be seducer and the GM) decide to discuss the odds. That IS something Holmes chooses to bring out in the account, so presumably he considers it important. <br/><br/>Maybe the situation was just fine... but it comes across as potentially very creepy and uncomfortable in the article.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's all conjecture at this point.<br/><br/>Aside from the discussion about the Naga's virginity, the only information I can see in this article about the sexual content of the game is this single paragraph:\n<blockquote><br/>The sexual innuendos of my teenage Dungeons &amp; Dragons game did not become manifest until my players reached their adolescent growth spurt. Before that, the game was all hack, slash, loot, pillage, and burn. Later, characters began to get interested in sex and, eventually, marriage.</blockquote>\nIt's interesting how some people are interpreting this paragraph as:<br/><br/>* This is an older dude with a bunch of young teens "acting out" on each other, and creating weird uncomfortable situations without any prior discussion of what they want out of the game. This girl is being bullied, basically.<br/><br/>And some people are, rather, assuming:<br/><br/>* This is a group of mature people who tackle love, marriage, and sexuality openly in their games, and I'm sure they have discussed this kind of issue in the past and enjoy dealing with it in play.<br/><br/>I don't see a ton of evidence for either side, frankly, based on that single snippet above and the anecdote about the naga.<br/><br/>The thing that bothers me, I suppose, is that there's no mention of that particular moment or exchange being a <i>fun thing</i>. There's no mention of this girl Cicely particularly enjoying this moment, or why it was cool, or how it fit into the bigger picture. (Like Kira says, what was the girl's reaction to this? It's not mentioned at all.) There's also no mention of discussing this, particularly, to make sure everyone's on board, whether before or afterwards. Surely in a Psychology article, this would be an interesting thing to discuss?<br/> <br/>If I had to make assumptions myself, I would say that, yeah, it sounds like this girl's been bullied into giving a "percentage" chance after she's clearly refused twice, and about an area of play that's clearly not the focus of the game (otherwise, wouldn't they *know* by now whether the seductions have been successful? why is her virginity *suddenly* in question?).<br/><br/>How likely is it that this was actually the case? I'll give it 75% odds, and roll the dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361635/#Comment_361635" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T09:12:15+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  9:12AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 9:20AM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .........."I don't see a ton of evidence for either side, frankly, based on that single snippet above and the anecdote about the naga.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that bothers me, I suppose, is that there's no mention of that particular moment or exchange being a fun thing.

It should be assumed they'd leave if it was an issue"<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you read about a bowling league, I<i> used to think</i> it's safe to assume these are people who enjoy bowling.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as I know from Story-Games people patiently explaining it to me, and to Noisms, and other clueless RPG-enjoyers (here, f'rinstance:<br/>\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15676" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15676</a><br/>\n)<br/>\nThere are apparently lots of reasons that people who are not having fun play RPGs anyway. It is still strange to me, but I know now that it occurs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, you have to believe me when I say it is<i> <b>such </b></i> an alien concept (like: "I hate pizza, I eat it every day and it's terrible") to so many gamers--especially ones who saw old D&amp;D; and had a good group from day one and  liked it--that it may never have occurred to Holmes (who was so excited about D&amp;D; he wrote an edition of it) that there would one day arise a whole group of people who wanted to make sure a group playing a game every day was having fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if so, it never would have occurred to Holmes that he had to include all of these tidbits reminding these future-readers-whose-concerns-he-could-not-imagine that he and his players were enjoying and had chose to play in the playstyle he was describing unless his anecdote ended with "And then that player walked away and never played again".<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________<br/>\n<br/>\n(Now, I am <i>not</i> saying that it would never have occurred to Holmes (or me) that players of D&amp;D; sometimes do not have fun--merely that it many circles and in many contexts it is assumed that nonfun is a catastrophic and unusual disaster and so actual fun is the default if you are describing any kind of ongoing campaign. Which Holmes is.)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________<br/>\n<br/>\nEven now, it never occurs to me when I write an AP to remind my readers that everybody had fun. (Even though they did.) It never occurs to a lot of other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I have seen more than one indie AP report that ended with things like "Afterwards everyone said they enjoyed the game and felt satisfied with the outcome for their characters". Which still seems like an odd thing to have to say. But I believe you when you say that it is necessary for you otherwise you might think someone didn't have fun and had been pushed around by the rules/GM/social contract.<br/>\n<br/>\n___________<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone here see that?<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside the context assumed here in this forum in 2012 it doesn't necessarily seem oh-so-obvious that you need to report to your readership that the members of your bowling club liked bowling the way the bowling club they were members of did bowling.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, again, as I've been saying all along--there's a possibility this is the tip of an iceberg and Holmes is actually a bad DM and a jerk, but the inability to see past your own context and see why Holmes may not have written the words you want to hear provides an equally reasonable explanation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361636/#Comment_361636" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T09:22:31+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  9:22AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite><br>until I read Ron Edwards essay (2 years ago? 3?) about his experiences with people who are totally dedicated to D&amp;D but hated it and never had any fun the existence of people that play and simultaneously do not enjoy the game was unknown to me.

Sure, my lived experience is that when I was a teenager that kind of sexual hazing was something that happened in my group, and in OOC terms I got hit on a number of times by men up to 15 years my senior who wouldn't take no for an answer - not a graceful no, not a blunt no; my choices always devolved down to throwing a big public tantrum, cutting the guy dead, or leaving both my social group and a hobby that I liked.  And of course, hurting the feelings of someone that I did like at a friendship level, which sucks to have to do.  And I grew up and got a broader range of people to know, and found more of those kinds of guys, and a lot more who <i>could</i> be responsible for their own actions, but it's the jerks who make themselves disproportionately known.  And that's in a lot of different places, not just roleplaying, but any hobby or workplace that's dominated by men - the jerks make themselves known.  It's easier to cope with when you have more choices about who you're going to spend time with, but for me as a teenager, there was only one game in town.<br><br>You mentioned having mobility?  Even walking out on your family if you weren't enjoying yourself?  That's a choice you get to make for yourself - for a lot of people there are often going to be social reasons for trying to make a group event work out, whether it's family or hobby related.  And also, because other parts of the experience are fun and worth making an effort for. That doesn't stop it being a red flag if someone's being leaned on in the game.<br><br>Another thought for people who are interested in textual analysis - in his article, Holmes spends a lot of time emphasising how people's characters are agents of the players, where detachment is important.  They're talked about as "my thief does X", "my magic-user does Y"; they're being given the opportunity to act out compared to their regular lives; the couple of expy ports were 'failed' characters that tended to hang out at the back observing instead of engaging with the world.  But the instant they start talking about sex it gets tied to real life - the hazing in the game was linked to real life sexual tension, Grog the beast was known to the player's real life girlfriend as someone she saw in the bedroom.  An interesting shift, yes?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment"

Of course he didn't think people would see it as problematic. Why would you publish something you know people would hate? (Unless you have an axe to grind, which doesn't seem to be the case.) The question is whether he had good, supportable reasons for thinking it was non-problematic, or whether he was overlooking real problems.\n<blockquote>Basically the interpretation:<br><br>"We have no idea what these games were really like or whether Holmes was an ass"<br><br>seems the only rational conclusion anyone can draw from this article.</br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nI agree in absolutist terms. There is no way to <i>really</i> know that it was problematic. It's possible that Holmes was a very conscious feminist who had a carefully negotiated (explicitly or implicitly) framework for handling potentially touchy situations. But I think I think we can be <i>relatively</i> certain that it was bad, given its very close resemblance to incredibly common sexist situations (as testified to by all of the women who have posted in this thread), and it's utter lack of resemblance of the perfectly positive forms of sexual interaction that I see every day. (I am an active member of the BDSM community, so I am totally aware of the possibility for very sexually charged situations and the way they can be non-problematic.)<br><br>I want to digress a bit and talk about the "Holmes-is-an-ass" gloss of our position. I don't think it's very fair, because we're not accusing Holmes of any special malice. The whole nature of sexism is that it's primarily unconscious and not thought about. It's more than likely that he didn't give the incident a second thought. I don't think he's a terrible person (even if our interpretation is correct) or even that he should be singled out for rebuke. Rather, he's acting as an example of the general pattern of sexist behavior which is the default, and which we would like to break out of. We're the ones doing the weird thing, not him.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361736/#Comment_361736" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T11:47:00+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 11:47AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 11:48AM by JDCorley.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>Or, in your much more aggressive, over-reachy and extreme language, he does not:<br><br>" believe in listening to the players:"<br><br>" believe in allowing all characters equal agency in sexual matters instead of forcing it on the woman's character:"</br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nWell, his example that he chose and wrote about shows he doesn't adhere to those beliefs all the time, if he has them, so...he acted like an ass?

What I mostly disagree with is two things:<br><br>1) The idea that if the PCs are acting anti-social, then that is inherently problematic and rife with issues.  <br><br>I don't agree about this.  In lots of games - including Paranoia, Hellcats &amp; Hockeysticks, Fiasco, Amber Diceless, Apocalypse World, and many others - I've had a lot of player characters acting like major jerks and the atmosphere among the players is that this is all in good fun.  For example, I ended one Fiasco game by gunning down another PC after having set his house on fire, without having had any special negotiation over it.  <br><br>2) The idea that using die rolls to resolve seduction of a PC is sexist and related to rape as it removes sexual agency.  <br><br>This depends on interpretation.  I definitely agree that there is a lot of sexism within RPGs.  However, I don't think that a roll for seduction is inherently sexist or bullying.  A lot of games - including many modern ones - use rolls to resolve social conflicts.  For example, while I haven't seen a PC-to-PC seduction per se in Dogs in the Vineyard - I have seen social conflicts where actions are forced on another PC that involved pushing for the "Physical" dice by a kiss.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>It's interesting how some people are interpreting this paragraph as:<br><br>* This is an older dude with a bunch of young teens "acting out" on each other, and creating weird uncomfortable situations without any prior discussion of what they want out of the game. This girl is being bullied, basically.<br><br>And some people are, rather, assuming:<br><br>* This is a group of mature people who tackle love, marriage, and sexuality openly in their games, and I'm sure they have discussed this kind of issue in the past and enjoy dealing with it in play.<br><br>I don't see a ton of evidence for either side, frankly, based on that single snippet above and the anecdote about the naga.<br><br>The thing that bothers me, I suppose, is that there's no mention of that particular moment or exchange being a<i>fun thing</i>.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nI don't know where you get the above.  I don't think either of the above seem at all likely, yet you are presumably saying that Zak or I are assuming the latter.  In my view, people can be immature and not discuss issues - but yet still not be bullies or jerks.  For example, when I watched young teenage kids in my class last year, I saw some playing Truth or Dare.  They were awkward, immature, egging each other on, and didn't maturely discuss the issues raised by their game - but they also weren't being sexist assholes, and it wasn't something that I felt I had to come lecture them about.  (Among other things, it was the girls who were dragging the reluctant guys into the game.)  <br><br>I agree that the situation raised in the article with the naga is ambiguous.  My view is influenced by a few things.  The GM does demand that there be <b>a</b> chance of seduction, but he accepts what the player says as the odds, and the PC is indeed not seduced in the game.  That doesn't strike me as consistent with the interpretation that the GM was set on bullying the player into accepting sexual advances.  Also, that the character happened to be a virgin was something that was only invented at a point in the adventure where it would be really useful to be a virgin.  (While UserClone compared it to forcing a defined Hindu character to eat steak.)  <br><br>It seems to me that the general tone of his article is that the game is a fun pastime for the players.  He doesn't specifically mention player-level reactions at most of the points, but unless stated otherwise, my reading is that he (at least) felt that that part was consistent with his overall point.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361739/#Comment_361739" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T11:49:46+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 11:49AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 11:50AM by JDCorley.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>The GM does demand that there be<b>a</b>chance of seduction, but he accepts what the player says as the odds...</blockquote>\nNo, he doesn't.

Let me try one possible parallel: <br><br><i>The party discovers a powerful magic sword that can only be wielded by one who is pure of heart and pure of body.  One player says "Hell, yeah, I'm pure of heart and body - I can take the sword."  The GM questions this - saying that the wielder must never have had sex or taken a drink.  The player again affirms.  One of the other players points out, "Hold on, Pat's been hanging out with us in the bars for the past three adventures with all our drinking and philandering."  So the GM demands a roll.  <br/></i><br><br>I assert that even though the GM did not accept the players' statement as absolute truth about the character, the GM in the above is not necessarily a ass.  <br><br>I think it not necessarily behaving like an ass to treat PC temptations as something that must be rolled for.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361752/#Comment_361752" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T12:12:14+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 12:12PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll respond but I dont think a bunch of hypotheticals will prove anything.

We see this when the ordinarily placid centaur player loses his temper when his PC was "robbed and abused" by the magic-user.  "It's the magic-user who did that to you," says the magic-user's player. "I didn't do it, he did!"  Holmes lets this assertion stand.<br><br>His game also freely imports material from real life.  Never mind the magic-user/naga sex thing; you've got players playing themselves as PCs in this game!<br><br>It seems to me like there's a big opportunity for a bully to use the imaginary world as a fig leaf for real-world abuse.  I feel that the DM in such a game, by legitimizing the character-actions-are-not-player-actions defense, would be a complicit enabler of such bullying.  And in this case, the potential harm is compounded because the players are pre-teens or teenagers and the DM is not just the in-game authority figure but is the real-life authority figure as well.<br><br>I think that if I were the adult DM for a group of D&amp;D-playing teenagers, I would use a different approach than Holmes, and I'd monitor like crazy for this kind of thing.  <br><br>I wish Holmes were here to ask about the risks of bullying.  I wonder if he ever felt like he had to confront a bully in his game, and if so, what did he do?<br><br>Also, it's interesting that the characters are never referred to by name; they're refered to by their race or class.  I wonder if the characters in this game even had names?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361820/#Comment_361820" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T14:14:06+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  2:14PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 2:35PM by Andy.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Taking an argument about what someone<i>said</i>, and turning it into an argument about who someone<i>is</i>.</blockquote>\nTo play devil's advocate, it's not the trolling that's doing that; he's empathizing with a Hobby Elder, and seeing the arguments posed against the behavior that guy expressed as an attack on That Guy. And the Hobby, and likely Himself. In other words, he thinks that "we" (Story Games? Some folks? A few guys? Whatever, anyway...) are taking an argument about what Holmes said, and painting him as a creepy/ill person in real life. I don't /actually see/ that conclusion drawn anywhere above (I just reread the first page; nope! no personal attacks, just people having problems with the depiction of that one session, and making no "I bet Holmes is THIS KIND OF PERSON IN REAL LIFE" claims from there), but it's not too large of a leap for someone really invested in Holmes' character to make.<br><br>While the behavior is kinda boorish, it's not so much trolling as the confusion of attack on behavior for attack on character. Folks* are really invested in what kind of a person this Holmes guy was!<br><br>The best comment which underlines this thread of the discussion comes from JD: <b>Yep, looks like the guy was being a jerk here</b>. (followed by "I'm a jerk sometimes, too! I try not to be, but sometimes I am!") <br>Not that he was a jerk In Real Life. Or a "crypto date-rapist" (WTF?) (shit, how many folks do we know who are awesome in real life but a little too aggressive at board games, video games, sports, etc)<br>Nor was he a jerk in all of his games, even with women! (what's that joke about the statistician seeing a black sheep and saying "all sheep are black?")<br>Plus, haven't we all been jerks at the table at least once? Let the person who was not a jerk at the table cast the first bronze d20<br><br>Do we need to take a poll here, and every participant in this thread steps up saying "While I said that I found that behavior in the example sexist/unfun/creepy/dumb/whatever, I don't therefore imply that this is how Hobby Elder Holmes was in real life, or even in his other gaming sessione; I am simply calling upon the behavior I see in this single example" ? Cause I'd wager that most of the folks would agree to such a thing (the only one implying that this discussion is about ALL of Holmes' games and his personage is Zak), and that the only way to prove otherwise is to like look up/interview other women that Holmes gamed with at various times in his life, how he conducted himself, etc etc. <br><br>That would be a worthless waste of time, I think folks would more than concede to the Court of the Old School Renaissance:<br><br>"<b><i>I concede that I don't know anything about this man, what he is like, or what his other gaming sessions were like. I will heartily accept that he was a Good Man, Great Friend and otherwise Excellent Game Master. I simply see the behavior in this one single example, and call what I saw. I do not therefore stain the reputation of the Gaming Elder by declaring him sexist, a rapist, a creep; just solely the behavior witnessed on the night in 1980 in Psychology Today.</i></b>"<br>Would that allow the defense to Rest Their Case, to the satisfaction of the jury?<br><br>-Andy<br><br>* (well, one Folk anyway)

We see this when the ordinarily placid centaur player loses his temper when his PC was "robbed and abused" by the magic-user.  "It's the magic-user who did that to you," says the magic-user's player. "I didn't do it, he did!"  Holmes lets this assertion stand.</blockquote>\nIt seems like here you're saying it is doing "real world harm" to a player if they get mad when another player does something to their character in a game.  <br/><br/>I very strongly disagree with this.  If my character attacks another PC, that is not necessarily doing "real world harm" to the player, even if they get mad.  It is pretty common in games of any sort for a player to get mad at some point - but that doesn't mean that real-world harm has been done to them.  Sometimes anger is justifiably based on a breaking of social norms, but other times the anger is not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361836/#Comment_361836" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T14:47:28+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  2:47PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 2:48PM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Andy">@Andy</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI don't <i>even</i> think an attack on Holmes (vaguely conveyed to us by his essay) <i>behavior </i> is appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Whether he's an "elder" is irrelevant as well, we could be looking at a Luke Crane AP and I'd feel the same way.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think extrapolating Holmes (or anyone's) behavior (even a second of it) from what this particular vague article said is indicative of fair or rigorous thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain: I am totally willing to have a conversation about this because this issue interests me.

I think there's a good chance he may have done it."<br/>\n<br/>\n(Now we come to an Old School technical question, bear with me:<br/>\nWe can assume that Last Session was, say, in game-world-time on a Wednesday during the day, today's session refers to a Thursday during the day. An un-narrated-because-irrelevant-to-the-main-adventure night--or maybe more--has intervened. So, basically, realize that it is possible and common to assume in a trad RPG that time passes off-screen between adventures.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHolmes describes here in his essay "a minute pause".<br/>\n<br/>\nHolmes thinks <i>Oh god, this could become a thing with Jackass tryna sleep with Cicely's character because he's frustrated in real life. If I go 'No, Cicely said no' it might look like I, the DM, am overruling him and he might keep needling <b>her</b> but if I give Cicely herself a chance with all of us watching to say 'Nope, not gonna' in no uncertain terms directly in the face of his announcing he's trying to seduce her, it may chastise/embarass him enough to make him realize he's kinda being an ass and we can move on with the more important parts of the game than Cicely and Jackass trying to negotiate whether they are going to have sex in real life by proxy.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nHolmes: "Do you think that's possible, Cicely?"<br/>\n(Here in Scenario B, Holmes is assuming she'll say 'No' in no uncertain terms.)<br/>\n<br/>\nCicely: "I think she'd refuse"<br/>\n(Cicely tone of voice says this in a way like:<br/>\nI am thinking as an actress--i.e. not as in what Edwards would call 'Pawn' stance--and I am <i>thinking</i> this character the way I understand her<i> would</i> refuse. But the emphasis in her sentence is on the word "think".)<br/>\n<br/>\n(Holmes looks over at Jackass. And notices--depressingly--Jackass is not calmed and seems like he is on the point of making an issue over this. Holmes, being a grown-up and a good DM, realizes this not only could get real old real fast in the game but could erupt into a whole embarrassing dysfunctional spat between these two kids if he does not vent the steam and give Jackass--and Cicely--a graceful out.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(Now we come to another technical point:<br/>\nthere are times in Trad RPGs when--while negotiating 'offscreen' events--PCs make decisions that the Player did not specifically endorse<br/>\nTo cite an example roughly contemporaneous with this event, see the Midkemia cities between-session tables:<br/>\n<a href="http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2011/07/where-hell-have-you-been-flake-table.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2011/07/where-hell-have-you-been-flake-table.html</a><br/>\nwhich are used to determine stuff PCs do off-screen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether or not this is the kind of game you want to play, this is a game some people like playing--one where their PC is moved to make choices they--the players--did not make and the player deals with the consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo cite a current example--frequently used--of this kind of play, see Jeff's Carousing Table:<br/>\n<a href="http://jrients.blogspot.com/2008/12/party-like-its-999.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://jrients.blogspot.com/2008/12/party-like-its-999.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, even if Cicely is NOT down with her PCs sex life being given special "off-screen" rules, she has an out--see below)<br/>\n<br/>\n(Which is all to say, at this point Holmes decides to put Cicely's refusal in strict game terms so as to--again--save both Cicely and Jackass from having to hash all this repressed hormonal activity out in public.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(So, to vent Jackass' steam, he says\u2026)<br/>\n<br/>\nHolmes: "What do you think the chances that she got talked into it are?"<br/>\n<br/>\nJackass: "Fifty percent." (Which is still a Jackass thing to say, but it at least means Jackass' energy has been channeled into something Holmes can now whittle away at in game terms.)<br/>\n<br/>\nCicely: (Holmes is expecting her to say 0 and end it.)<br/>\n"Twenty Five."<br/>\n(Now in the scenario as presented by some-but-not-all others, she only says this because she fears some sort of social pressure and has been beaten down. Sure--absolutely possible<br/>\nabsolutely possible<br/>\nabsolutely possible<br/>\nabsolutely possible<br/>\nabsolutely possible<br/>\nabsolutely possible<br/>\nabsolutely possible<br/>\nabsolutely possible<br/>\n\u2026however, it is also possible this answer was down to any number of other motives. Here's one: Naga is not Cicely--just as my schizophrenic Call of Cthulhu PC is not me--and it might, on second thought, be interesting for Naga to be not exactly Cicely, personalitywise--from Cicely's POV. So, ok, while Naga is probably a virgin, this is by no means sure, now that Cicely thinks about it. Maybe Cicely is thinking maybe it might be fun to get a little Simulationist with it. )<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Holmes is surprised. 25% is not 0%. Who knew? Either way, the question has been described in game terms, he has set things up rhetorically so that this thing was about to be resolved in game terms (Jackass will probably make even more of an issue out all this BS if it does not now get resolved in game terms that Holmes has set up), so it's time to roll the dice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then the dice roll (using the numbers Cicely gave).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361857/#Comment_361857" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T15:16:44+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  3:16PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now Luke said:<br/>\n<br/>\n"I read two men bullying a young woman to accept sexual advances.

I can easily see that happening in a game. I have a couple responses, but I want to say right off the bat that there is a non-zero chance that something like that happened.<br><br>Two responses: First, even your version pretty actively problematic, in my opinion. Most of the misogyny is localized in Jackass, but there's still lots of it going on (most noticeably in the fact that seduction is framed as something that happens to women without much input on their part). I think the DM has a positive duty to do more than just "smooth things over" when someone is being that much of a dick. Either by saying, "Dude, you're being a dick", or by giving Cicely some agency by saying, "What's the Naga's deal toward him, anyway? What's she thinking about doing with regard to him?" Or maybe, if you want to be all "the rolls can lead to uncomfortable results", saying, "So his character keeps badgering you, what's the chance that he wears you down and creepy rapey sex happens?"<br><br>It's not as bad as the straightforward reading, but it's still pretty uncomfortable.<br><br>Second: I think your version has to stretch the text pretty far. First, why are you interpreting, "I think she'd refuse" as meaning "I don't know what would happen"? I can imagine intonations that would convey that, but they aren't the straightforward reading. If that was what was going on, why wouldn't Holmes say something like, "Her tone of voice made it clear that she wasn't sure, so I asked her..."? I don't see any reason, in the absence of any clues to the contrary, not to take her statement at face value.<br><br>Another problem is Holmes' claim that allowing Cicely to set the percentage chance was "exercising his prejudice in favor of females." The phrasing is pretty deeply creepy in the first place, and it suggests that he would have been well within his rights to remove even the small amount of agency he gave Cicely. Which is pretty problematic, in my opinion.<br><br>I totally see that my interpretation isn't the only possible one, but I see the preponderance of the evidence going in favor of "this was weird and creepy". (And if it wasn't weird and creepy, then at the very least he did a lousy job conveying its non-creepiness.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361899/#Comment_361899" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T16:13:37+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  4:13PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, it's so vague as written that it is a Lady and The Tiger story<br/>\n<br/>\n( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady,_or_the_Tiger%3F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady,_or_the_Tiger?</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nand so anyone who goes "Well I think it was the tiger" or "Well the signs point to tiger" is just being naive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361900/#Comment_361900" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T16:14:23+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  4:14PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like an internet arguement then because to me saying "I read" as opposed to "the way the article makes him sound" are virtually the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndy had it right a few posts back ...<br/>\n"Not that he was a jerk In Real Life.

Also, Cicely killed three other agents right before the game (and strangled a puppy!), Holmes' CIA handler told him by hidden mic halfway through the session, and he lashed out with a barb in-game: a barb, a point of pressure, we would later discover kept Cicely stymied enough to neutralize her planned communique to the Kremlin, and because of that we aren't wearing furry hats today!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361928/#Comment_361928" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T17:01:42+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  5:01PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Andy">@Andy</a><br/>\n<br/>\nResponsible Forum Guy Andy:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I ask you questions about this situation, will you answer them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361929/#Comment_361929" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T17:03:11+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  5:03PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, because I didn't add anything in to the story, like adding the tiger to the end of the O.

Just like you can imagine some "context" for Holmes' story in which he's not acting like a jerk.  And so can I, and so can everyone! I'm not in the Early D&amp;D Fanfic business (did I just accidentally settle the "what exactly <i>is</i> the Old School Renaissance" argument?!), so I'm not really that interested.<br><br>But in the story itself, he's a jerk.  I'm sure he didn't mean to be (jerks never do, they always feel they're just having fun or making a point), but it doesn't change the story.  She said "I didn't fuck" twice and he said "give me a percentage".  And didn't say "give me a percentage that you gave up on seducing her when she said no".  <br><br>Choosing to try to have sex with a lady is a choice that 100 percent happened exactly as the player says it did.  <br>Choosing to have sex with a dude, meh, no, it might not have happened exactly as you say it did, even though you said it twice. Let's roll for it.

If my character attacks another PC, that is not necessarily doing "real world harm" to the player, even if they get mad.  It is pretty common in games of any sort for a player to get mad at some point - but that doesn't mean that real-world harm has been done to them.  Sometimes anger is justifiably based on a breaking of social norms, but other times the anger is not.</br></br></br></blockquote>\nMaybe we are in agreement about this.  I don't think that player anger automatically implies real harm.<br><br>My point is that a visible emotional reaction is a bully's XP, and if that emotional reaction is dismissed as unsportsmanlike by the most powerful guy at the table, then the bully's victory is compounded.  So there's extra potential for harm in the play style Dr. Holmes describes. <br><br><sub>(This is a critical observation of Holmes' style of play, not of the specific campaign described in the article, or of Holmes' worth as a person.  We have no idea how often the players in the Holmes campaign freak out at the table.  Holmes does claim that the "players never erupt into bloodshed" so there's that, I guess.)</sub> </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361935/#Comment_361935" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T17:21:08+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  5:21PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 5:21PM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a><br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">@PeterBB</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn the He-Is-Being-An-Ass version of events he asks the girl what she wants 3 times for....some reason you have not explained or that has been explained different ways by different posters, feel free to fill in the blanks.

But I'll answer the question.<br/><br/>I think Luke's reaction to the article is very interesting, and there are elements of the text that support that reaction (If reactions were allowed which THEY'RE NOT). <b>I don't think we can claim to know what happened, back then. We can only claim to know how we are reacting to the text, now.</b> I think Luke's reaction is the latter, but I can see how you might think it's the former.<br/><br/>Normally, I'd be very curious about how a variety of people might react to the article and I'd want to encourage everyone to say whatever they wanted about it, because that would mean there would be more interesting reactions to read.<br/><br/>But, you know, you're the Boss. There really should be only ONE reaction to the article (complete and utter respectful silence), and everyone who didn't have that reaction is not only wrong, they're wasting our time! And they're probably <i>taking a shit right in Holmes' mouth right now.</i><br/><br/>Okay, whew, I got caught up in the moment, there. I'm not the Boss.

Your interpretation requires interpreting "I don't think so" as meaning the opposite of its plain meaning.<br/><br/>b) The phrase "exercising my prejudice in favor of females", which is problematic on its own in that it means he's treating players differently based on gender, and also it's phrased in a dehumanizing way. This increases the possibility that he is, in fact, not an enlightened being free of sexism.<br/><br/>c) The above phrase again, which in context implies that even giving her the ability to set the target number was a gift given to her by him, not what it was in your story (where it was a last-ditch effort to salvage a deeply problematic situation.)<br/><br/>and perhaps most importantly: <br/><br/>d) I have seen <i>way</i> more examples of that sort of "atrocity" than I've seen clever DMing tricks to enforce feminism. The prior probability of rape culture is way higher than the prior probability of clever feminist social engineering.<br/><br/>Also... your scenario B is not that much better than my account, because it presents a situation where one man was bullying her into accepting sexual advances, and the other was wimpishly trying to avoid a mess.

I feel like it requires more contortions to say, "It was all ironic!" than to say "He said that he required her to set a target number after she said it wouldn't happen. I bet he did what he said he did."<br><br/>But let's say the text is exactly as much a blank slate as you want to say it is, because I think perhaps the most interesting bit is that last part.\n<blockquote>This is just saying this matches Your Experience. Which is just another way of saying you have baggage from games you've seen that you are bringing to this issue. Of course you could accuse me of the same, but I'm not the one saying one scenario is more likely than the other. You are. That's an important difference. If you want to check my baggage, I have never played with anybody who acted like Jackass--but I am not stupid enough to claim that this means that my experience is typical.</blockquote>\nFirst off, I never limited this to games. Rape culture is everywhere. I would be <i>very</i> surprised if you've never encountered it. Just read the comments on any youtube video or reddit post where a woman is even peripherally involved. If you disagree with this point, then we have a much more fundamental disagreement than our interpretation of this particular article.<br/><br/>Secondly, both of the women who have posted in this thread (limiting it to people who have identified their gender, I obvious can't be sure of people's gender over the internet) have pointed out that, in their experience, this matches the description of the bad experiences they've had in RPGs. I'm having trouble getting comment links to work, but see StephaniePegg and Anansigirl's posts. Admittedly this is a small sample size, but I tend to think it's more likely for men to miss sexism than for women to think they've experienced it when they haven't. So I feel like I'm on pretty solid empirical ground here, even limiting it to the context of gaming.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361989/#Comment_361989" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T18:55:54+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  6:55PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 6:58PM by JDCorley.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>You just added "Not good enough"<br/><br/>That is you adding stuff<em>again.</em></blockquote>\nTrue, ya got me.

I'm totally seducing your character right now cause that's the only way I'm interested in interacting with a girl at the table. I'm pretty sure our characters have had sex at some point, even though you're saying you're a virgin) come up all the time.

So a bit more context/analysis.<br><br>Society regularly portrays (hetero-)sexuality as a competition between genders. Specifically, men are supposed to choose women to pursue, and then attempt to seduce them. Women are supposed to take a more passive role, where they are the recipients of this seduction. There are a number of ways women can "fail" at meeting societal expectations: they can choose not to sleep with men who pursue them (this is known as being "frigid", "stuck up", "full of herself", "prudish", etc.). They can choose to sleep with too many of the men who pursue them, or make the wrong choices of which men to sleep with (this is called being a "slut", "whore", "easy", "loose"). They can take too active a role in the process ("pushy", "unfeminine", "shameless"). <br><br>This division of labor includes the following expectations: men will choose on which terms flirting happens; women should be flattered when they are hit on; women need to decide when sex is not going to happen, because men are going to take any chance they can get; being uncomfortable with any of the above makes women some combination of "prudish" and "not a good sport".<br><br>This model, where men push at women's boundaries, and women just defend them, leads to one of the serious problems with our culture, which feminists like to call the "rape culture" aspect. (Part of) rape culture is that men will naturally walk all over women's boundaries if they get the chance, and that women are responsible for ensuring this doesn't happen to them. <br><br>Thus: the idea that the natural way to adjudicate a sexual situation is "a saving throw against seduction" fits right into this deeply problematic paradigm. It's based on the idea that women have to actively defend against having sex, and that a gap in the defenses is implied consent.<br><br>Sure, there are other ways the same mechanic could be used in non-problematic ways, but the way he talks about it in the text makes me suspect he's using this model.<br><br><a href="/forums/profile/Zak">@Zak</a>: First off, I'm sorry Mandy doesn't feel comfortable here. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> That speaks pretty poorly to this community. Her perspective is interesting and welcome. (EDIT: As is yours, Zak. Your blog is one of my favorite things on the internet, even though I don't play old-school games.)<br><br>That said, I don't think the analysis requires that the woman in question be a delicate flower. What's problematic about the situation is not her reaction, but the situation itself. Women shouldn't <i>have</i> to constantly be sticking up for themselves (any more than men should). Even if her reaction had been, "Fuck you! Or rather, never fuck you! My character slaps your character for being a boor," it would still be a problem because she shouldn't have had to be in that situation in the first place.<br><br><a href="http://pervocracy.blogspot.com/2011/11/strong-woman.html" rel="nofollow">This</a>is a good blog post that addresses this topic.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362026/#Comment_362026" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T19:57:30+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  7:57PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/The">@The</a> Boss:<br><br>I have to admit, QUESTION 7 confuses me!!!!<br><br>We're talking about a text, not a person, so I can't fathom how the question fits in.

I agree. Which is why the main interpretation I've been defending is that Jackass was being a bully, and Holmes did not see the problem with this. If he saw a problem with it, he should have acted to stop it, rather than facilitate it. EDIT: And I think it's pretty clear that we're meant to assume they identified with their characters. Holmes introduces that section by talking about how sexual tension between people translated into sexual tension between characters.<br><br>2. I would be interested to hear it, but I don't know if this environment is the safest place to have that conversation. (Plus it might just be threadjacking, although I think this thread is pretty jacked already.) If you want to talk about it, go for it, but if you would rather not (or want to make a new thread or something), that's cool too.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362036/#Comment_362036" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T20:16:40+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  8:16PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">@PeterBB</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI explained one way in which he could have been doing just that (acting to mitigate the bullying).

I've never played D&amp;D, but I've certainly been in situations where I didn't want to leave, but had issues with some specific part of it. Like when I was in a ballet performance, and felt that they expected us to commit more time to it than was reasonable (or than was communicated when I signed up). Or when I did community theatre, and there was a girl who kept hitting on me in a way I found uncomfortable. Or like being the president of my college's BDSM club, where I feel like dominant men (like me) are given a little more deference than is actually deserved or comfortable for everyone. I think the existence of the game is a great reason to think there was more good than bad, but that doesn't mean there was <i>zero</i> bad.<br><br>EDIT: Although I'm not sure it's even required that there's more good than bad. I broke up an Apples to Apples game the other day by saying, "Hey, if people are having fun, you should keep playing, but if not, feel free to do something else." Literally everyone would prefer to do something else, but the inertia of the game kept it from stopping.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362061/#Comment_362061" name="Item_212" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T20:54:26+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  8:54PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou are assuming/interpolating that she changed her mind in response to pressure rather than because she made a decision to change her mind that was<i> not</i> a response to pressure.

I've seen it done right occasionally, but also seen it gone wrong the vast majority of the time, so thinking about how that ratio could be improved (or even just hearing about how some people can enjoy it all the time because of their own preferences, if that's not possible) would be simply awesome.

I understand that you genuinely reacted to the text by feeling that the GM was acting like a jerk and/or bully.  I read the same text and did not have the same reaction.  The text seemed consistent with a fun, non-bullying game - though it also was potentially consistent with an annoying game, depending on the social circumstances.  <br><br>Part of the difference between our reactions may have to do with assumptions we make about what was happening at Holmes' gaming table.  <br><br>However, it also seems like it has to do with what we consider to be jerk-like behavior regardless of the larger context.  It seems like some people are saying that <i>regardless of circumstances</i>, whatever the player declares about the character should be 100% accepted.  So if the player declares that the character is a virgin, then it is inherently jerk-like behavior to suggest otherwise.  Similarly if the player declares that the character is Hindu, or teetotaler, or any other background.  However, I don't generally feel this way.  I think it can be OK for others to say things about my character, even if it throws me off for a time.  <br><br>For example, in the last game of Fiasco I played (a few months ago at Big Bad Con), Leonard Balsera was also playing.  I had a scene where my character told his daughter that he didn't smoke more than two joints of pot a day - but then Leonard threw in a scene that showed him smoking vastly more than that.  So Leonard changed my character into a liar (to his daughter) and a drug abuser as opposed to a casual user.  It threw me, and I wouldn't want it to happen all the time, but I rolled with it, and I don't think that he was being a jerk by that action.  <br><br>To PeterBB - I agree that people can put up with un-fun things in a game in general.

And very welcome!<br><br>EDIT: I think a lot of people *have* had bad experiences with this kind of play. (And probably the main reason we don't have similar numbers of people who have had bad experiences with Sorcerer or My Life with Master or whatever is because those games haven't been around as long, so it's not necessarily a dig at the play culture.) And so they will approach this kind of play style with hesitation and fear, and read actual play accounts with great skepticism.

Like, what is the hypothetical fun, non-bullying version of this story that you're interpolating? Or is it just what we've discussed already? Zak posted a nice "alternative reading" scenario which I found very interesting, and was an angle I hadn't considered.<br><br>When looking at this story, and whether it's a tale of good game or bad game, is there a specific element or two which would make all the difference? And, if so, can those elements be distilled into useful advice or play methods?<br><br>That would be something useful from this thread, finally. And very welcome!<br><br>EDIT: I think a lot of people *have* had bad experiences with this kind of play. (And probably the main reason we don't have similar numbers of people who have had bad experiences with Sorcerer or My Life with Master or whatever is because those games haven't been around as long, so it's not necessarily a dig at the play culture.) And so they will approach this kind of play style with hesitation and fear, and read actual play accounts with great skepticism. So discussing the positives of this playstyle would be tremendously useful for a lot of people.<br>I've brought up a couple of other examples in this thread: like gunning down another PC at the end of a game, or Leonard's writing in details about my character during Fiasco.  I just noticed another example as I was working on my report on attending DunDraCon 2012.  At DunDraCon 2007, I played in an event <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/cons/dundracon2007.html#mayitakeyourcoat" rel="nofollow"><b>My I Take Your Coat</b></a> using All Flesh Must Be Eaten.  As I put it, \n<blockquote>For me, there was a key bit in the introduction. At first, I had been picturing him as someone who fancies himself as a "man of the people" but is still full of upper-class priviledge and doesn't really understand. However, as he was arriving at the mansion, I improvised how he chatted up the butler, saying "So, James, how is your wife?" The GM responded with "I don't have a wife, sir, and my name is Sam."<br><br>Now, in acting improv, that's a bit of a stumbling point. I accepted it, however, and at that point Jeremiah went from ignorant to being a complete hypocrit. It actually turned out interesting, because I played up his "good side" even more -- while in the end he turned out horribly evil.</br></br></blockquote>\nI think the point is that rather than getting stuck in a rut about what the character is "really" like, players can be looser and/or less serious with their characters.  That bit from AFMBE really flipped my picture of the character, and it turned out to be fun playing the bad guy.  <br><br>More broadly, though, it seems like people have problems with the anti-social actions of the PCs.  I don't play much D&amp;D, but this seems a lot like games I've played of Paranoia, Hellcats &amp; Hockeysticks, Apocalypse World, Fiasco, and other games.  Also, the campaign that I'm playing in now of Call of Cthulhu has just started shifted into more of the "shotguns and dynamite" approach as opposed to the "library research" approach.  I'm not sure there is a clear way to express this.  It's much like, say, playing hard to trick someone and take away their real-world money in a game of poker, but still enjoying the struggle either way and enjoying beer afterward.  So my character shotguns down your character, but it's understood that this is just a part of the game.  For me, one of the whole points of games is to break usual social norms.  It makes for a much funner atmosphere if everyone is clear that this is just a game where characters will do things that the players don't.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg" title="StephaniePegg"><img alt="StephaniePegg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/185/n6ACKVL4YBWQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg">StephaniePegg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362147/#Comment_362147" name="Item_245" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T22:56:40+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 10:56PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 10:57PM by StephaniePegg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I've been monitoring this thread through my working day with a certain amount of bogglement, and since people have been quoting me, I have some thoughts to share:<br><br>- When do you guys sleep?  Seriously?  ;-)<br>- Zak S, I'm sorry your friend didn't feel comfortable that she could sign in and speak for herself.  I'm fairly new to this forum myself, and people have seemed pretty decent so far.  That said, I think the most argumentative person in this thread so far has been you.<br>- I don't think it's relevant whether Cicely the Naga was a fainting flower, "one of the boys", flirting, or planning to deck her soon-to-be-ex-boyfriend shortly after the game.  Why should she have to put up with that crap?  Or anyone?<br>- Zak proposed a hypothesis of player motivations that painted Holmes as a Good Guy (TM) trying to smooth over a tricky situation.  With respect, I think that while it's possible, it's not plausibly supported by the text: that whole article is about social dynamics in roleplaying and Holmes' own reaction to it (eg feeling sad when his players didn't notice cool stuff in his setting).  If he'd felt he had to consciously manage player expectations in that incident, I think he would have made a point in mentioning it in a psychology article.  (1)  And he doesn't, he treats it like a joke.<br>- Several other people have presented an alternate hypothesis that suggest there was harrassment.  I think that this <i>is</i> supported by the text: Holmes describes both of his groups as using the roleplaying space to act out, fulfill wishes, and grief their team mates.  He cites specific other examples of male player characters groping or raping female NPCs.  He cites another example of a player becoming upset about griefing, and implies that it's not his problem to deal with as a GM.  It's notable that the sexual harassment of NPCs is only described as happening to female characters.  (2)<br>- Someone else made a comment about conduct, how to handle something like this if it happened again?  I think a really basic thing would be to challenge the boy who made a fiat assertion about someone else's character, rather than the girl who made a fiat assertion about her own.  Or if it's outside of the normal vibe of the game, call a brief timeout and check people's assumptions.<br>- PeterBB has made some very good points about 'rape culture' and yes, this culture is informing my opinion, and what I can read from Holmes' conduct.  A saving throw is something you make to avoid damage, to not have to do something you don't want to do.  And that got pushed on to the girl who'd raised objections rather than the boy who was challenging someone else's boundaries.<br><br>Anyway, my two cents.<br><br>(1) Because that's what people do when they're interested in game dynamics - they talk about it with real life examples, the same way I've seen people write examples about the effect the play space, provision of refreshments and sexual antics of their player group can have.<br>(2) I'm curious - can someone with better knowledge of D&amp;D history tell me when Dark Elves and that male bondage paradigm?  That still has problematic elements but I'm wondering when it got introduced to the hobby.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362152/#Comment_362152" name="Item_246" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T23:06:34+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 11:06PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 11:11PM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI have already explained how that situation is not parallel.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were parallel, Holmes goes: "Did you sleep with her?""Yes"<br/>\n"Did you sleep with him?""No."<br/>\n"Ok, I am going with Jackass"<br/>\n<br/>\nHe went, in effect:<br/>\n"You are trying to convince her to sleep with you, right?

Even when it's Ifs and Maybes.  Saying that it's such a serious charge that people shouldn't even consider it happening, shouldn't look objectively at the evidence as to whether it <i>did</i> happen, shouldn't talk about how to avoid it happening in the future?

Obvious we both agree that it's a terrible thing, and that it should never happen. But in reality, it happens <i>incredibly</i> often. Go on any relatively large internet site where people (especially geeks) talk about things, and see what happens when a woman comes up under any context. Massive harassment-fest, pretty much 100% of the time.  In real life, I witness sexual harassment pretty often, especially at parties. In my pre-feminist teen years, I myself did one or two things that I would now classify as harassment. So, yeah, I guess it is a serious accusation, but it's not like we're saying he's specially problematic, just that he's a relatively typical gamer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362161/#Comment_362161" name="Item_250" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T23:32:29+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 11:32PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg">@StephaniePegg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone in this thread were investigating this or trying to contact Cicely or anyone involved  or gather additional facts I'd totally agree with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they're not.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'm not so much concerned about the extreme edge of accusations of sexual harassment - but more about how the described behavior is bad regardless of social circumstance.  <br/><br/>So first the agreement part - weird sexual issues do certainly come up in games.  I am reminded of an old thread on The Forge that I start called <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=6543.0" rel="nofollow"><b>"Horseplay gone too far?"</b></a>  There I had some issues in a Lord of the Rings game, when I shapeshifted to a horse and went to interact with another horse - and the GM rules that the horse was a stallion, implying that talking was out of the question because he just wanted to mate.  (And when mating was questioned, he rules that as a human transformed, my horse form was constantly in heat.)  That to me was definitely an odd sexual dynamic - but in part because I knew the social circumstances, since the player was me.  <br/><br/>However, I don't see that this case <i>necessarily</i> problematic, though it could have been.  In many games that I've been in, things were left undefined unless they were important for the plot.  So, for example, two characters might flirt during scenes of the game, but it is never brought up as part of the game whether they have slept together.  That is left discretely undefined, until it is important for the plot to know - such as needing to know virginity for the unicorn.  <br/><br/><b>If</b> Holmes' game were similar to games of my experience, then the GM would have asked a roll for the boy player <i>if</i> it was important to know that for the current action.  If the only thing important for the action to resolve was the virginity, then that's all he'd roll for.  However, I could picture the following happening: <br/><br/>Boy player: "Remember my magic-user has been trying to seduce her for the past three games.  I think there's a good chance he may have done it." <br/><br/>GM: "Do you think that's possible, Cicely?"<br/><br/>Cicely: "I think she'd refuse."<br/><br/>GM: "What do you think the chances are that she got talked into it?"<br/><br/>Cicely: "Well, have I seen him flirt or seduce anyone else?  That would majorly affect the chances."<br/><br/>GM: "Well, Richard?" <br/><br/>Boy player: "No way.  I only have eyes for you, babe." <br/><br/>Another player: "Dick, you totally would have hit on the bar maids.  That's what your last character did."  <br/><br/>Richard: "No, I'm a one-naga man." (lamely)<br/><br/>GM: "OK, I'll set it at 50%."  <br/><br/>Obviously, this is hypothetical, but that's one way that I would interpret the GM's actions in this case.  While a double-standard could be at work, it is also consistent with the approach I'm showing here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362164/#Comment_362164" name="Item_252" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T23:48:10+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 11:48PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Feminist culture (read: third-wave-internet-feminist culture) tends to see call-outs as inherently useful.

I know that rape-like circumstances happen, but I dislike the interpretation that - say - any seduction of a PC is inherently problematic and rape-like.  I feel like there should be some acknowledgement that at least in <i>some</i> circumstances, a player might have fun in a game where you roll to avoid being seduced.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP" title="JimLotFP"><img alt="JimLotFP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP">JimLotFP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362205/#Comment_362205" name="Item_259" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T01:02:50+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  1:02AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg">@StephaniePegg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe drow were introduced in G3 Hall of the Fire Giant King published in 1978.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg" title="StephaniePegg"><img alt="StephaniePegg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/185/n6ACKVL4YBWQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg">StephaniePegg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362209/#Comment_362209" name="Item_260" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T01:16:48+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  1:16AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP">@JimLotFP</a>: Ta.<br><br><a href="/forums/profile/jhkim">@jhkim</a>: Thank you.  I think that portrayals of seduction in roleplaying aren't as of right problematic and can be done well, but that this particular instance as described by Holmes in the particular language and context he used implies a reasonable likelihood that it was problematic and involved danger and rape and negativity.  I have no idea what real life Cicely thought about it all - but it shares characteristics with the lived experiences that me and friends of mine have had that were unpleasant, and targeted at us because of our gender.<br/><br/>I think that Zak S has a presumption that where there is doubt, public opinion should by default side with the men in the equation.

I only turn to the dice when I feel that things are both important AND uncertain. In this case, the former was true, bot not the latter.

If he saw a problem with it, he should have acted to stop it, rather than facilitate it. EDIT: And I think it's pretty clear that we're meant to assume they identified with their characters.</blockquote>\nI don't see that at all. They're explicitly acting out. They have clear boundary between players and characters. There's also this:<br><br><i>"In order for the game to provide vicarious release for unacceptable behaviour, the entire group must go along with the convention that game roles are independent of the actual players."</i><br><br>That's pretty explicit. Obviously there was bleed. There's always bleed. Going to dice is a good way to control bleed, because it reduces identification. It also reduces agency, yes, but that's part of controlling bleed. The more freeform you go the easier bleed gets. No, Holmes probably didn't think of it in terms of bleed.<br/><br/>Holmes also mentions that they'd had players playing themselves. I find this consistent with low character identification: we used to do a fair amount of this, and while those games were weird they also tended to distance the player very quickly from the character -- if you try to identify with yourself as a character in a game it either becomes very boring or way way too troublesome, so in my experience the typical reaction is to step back. (Which is also why those characters didn't happen in high-identification games. They would not have been fun.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>What do you mean "why would she have responded?" Because she's roleplaying</blockquote>\nBecause that wasn't relevant at the time? Because while the seduction situation was presented in the game, the details were not played out but rather veiled? Because possibly most of the time, in that game, only two people who would need to know their characters are having sex are their players -- who would quite possibly talk about that outside the gaming table. I've played in several games like that.<br/><br/>Here's how such a thing can appear in game:<br/><br/><i>A: My character brings out the wine, and asks your character to come for a walk. "We can find a nice place to sit, look at the moon, and talk of small things."</i><br/><br/><i>B: "I'd like that."</i><br/><br/><i>A: We come back, what, two hours later?</i><br/><br/><i>B: Sounds about right.</i><br/><br/>Maybe A thought they had sex. Maybe B thought they had sex. Maybe not.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: StephaniePegg</cite>OK, so can your point be summarised as: "the act of calling something sexual harassment is more serious than the act of being sexually harassed"?</blockquote>\nI know that wasn't directed at me, but... ouch. Obviously not.<br/><br/>If anyone says they have been sexually harassed, the obvious correct assumption is that they're right and know what they're talking about.<br/><br/>If anyone is present when something that looks like sexual harassment occurs, the obvious correct action is intervention.<br/><br/>...but we're not talking about either of these. We're talking about putting an interpretation on something that happened over 30 years ago without having ever laid eyes on any of the principals, and having only a single account of the situation -- from a popular magazine, strongly tinged with the sexist language of the period.<br/><br/>(Yes, a lot of the language in that article is sexist. It is also par for course: it's that not sexist for a 1980 rag. It's also pretty clear Holmes wasn't at the forefront of feminist thought -- that still doesn't mean we get to point a finger and call it harassment from here.)<br/><br/>I don't for a moment dispute that it <i>could</i> have been harassment. I don't see that as the obvious reading, though.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>My impression is that many interpretations here portray the player Cicely as a hapless victim being bullied, that her accepting a chance of her character having sex must mean that she was abused into doing so, and in general that having sexuality in the game is a dangerous, problem-laden thing that requires lots of serious, mature discussion or else it will be rape-like.<br/><br/>That just doesn't sit well with me.  I know that rape-like circumstances happen, but I dislike the interpretation that - say - any seduction of a PC is inherently problematic and rape-like.  I feel like there should be some acknowledgement that at least in<i>some</i>circumstances, a player might have fun in a game where you roll to avoid being seduced.</blockquote>\nQFT.<br/><br/>For the record, Zak's "Interpretation B" was pretty much my first reading. Yes, I can see how it could have been terrible as well. We don't know. The obvious reading to me is boyjerk being a horny teenager, and Holmes using this as an example of how sexuality could come up in games without it being all wet and explicit. He's also telling how he and the rules mediated the situation.<br/><br/>Yes, it could have been a terrible situation, and yes, Holmes may even be trying to put a spin on it. It could also have been fun for everyone involved. Or it could have been an inconsequential speedbump en-route to the unicorn. We don't know.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362241/#Comment_362241" name="Item_264" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T04:03:16+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  4:03AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>I did not say that we should "side with the men".
