I too believed that it was impossible to play a fully narrativist larp, until I <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23950.0" rel="nofollow">played</a> <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/doubt" rel="nofollow">Doubt</a>, an award-winning Jeepform game ("scenario" isn't the right word, being replayable with different characters and stories) written by Fredrik Axelzon &amp; Tobias Wrigstad, that I consider fully coherent and narrativist in the Big Model sense (there is a single SIS, so I believe that the Big Model apply here)<br/><br/>Not all Jeepform could be called narrativist (or coherent), they always have a premise but not always the players are the ones that address it (often the theme is already written in the game). For example, another narrativist jeepform game is "<a href="http://jeepen.org/games/upgrade" rel="nofollow">The Upgrade</a>" (even if it's often much more funny than Doubt, that cut much more "close to home"), while the more recent <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/modregruppen" rel="nofollow">The Mothers</a> force the players to follow a precise behavior and theme and is more simulativistic (exploration of situation)<br/><br/>Other threads and blog post about Jeepform:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4237" rel="nofollow">Jeep Invasion Q&amp;A</a><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4297" rel="nofollow">How to Jeep(?)</a><br/><a href="http://www.fairgame-rpgs.com/comment.php?entry=127" rel="nofollow">Fair Game: conversations</a><br/><a href="http://www.fairgame-rpgs.com/comment.php?entry=141" rel="nofollow">Fair Game: why Jeep does not equal Larp</a>\n<blockquote><br/>is there such a thing as a GM-less / GM-ful LARP?</blockquote>\nIn "doubt" the GM assume the role of audience/questioner and make comments using monologues (and can add complications), but doesn't "exist" in the "story": every character is played by the players. In other freeform / nordic style larps I have often seen the GM in a very "hands-off" role, to the point that in some games the GM explain the rules, give the characters, and then go to the bar during the game, or go play in another GM's game...   :-)<br/>(I don't like it, though, the role of the GM as audience can't be dismissed even if he hasn't anything more to do in the game)<br/><br/>Sometimes instead the GM play the game as a player, with no special "powers", but in these cases I don't know how much I would call there games "GM-full".  <br/><br/>There is a lot of variations in these kind of games, and there are really a lot of them that I still don't know.<br/><br/>[edit: cross-posted with Seth.

(I could be mistaken, but this was the way I understood his request. It's true that he used the words "story-games", but every larp in the history of the world is a story game, so I looked at the entire post in context). And I know (and I played) really a lot of scene-based larps that I wouldn't consider narrativist at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155566/#Comment_155566" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T00:33:50+00:00" title="July  9, 2008 12:33AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, when we talk about LARPs, GDRLive, laiv, etc, there always the risk of misunderstandings caused by the different meanings of these words in different playing cultures.

Doing something like MET won't get you there without a new "layer" because MET is, at heart, very Sim. My own system (GLASS) is explicitly Sim (Generic Live Action Simulation System) with no claims about providing theme via the system (though I think my Commit rule can make for Drama, which seems like a close cousin to Theme).<br/><br/>That said, what do you look for for Nar play? I'd begin with a significant moral gray zone regarding some issue(s) key to play, and point all PCs squarely at the issue(s). Then, a bit of relationship mapping out to both stimulate initial meet-&amp;-greet, but would also provide a sort of "thematic axis" by which you can initially sort folks and help them approach the issue(s) based on either their own, real life beliefs or through character embodiment as suggested by the relationships and factions/axes. Finally, the system itself needs to enable resolution in manners suiting the issue(s) and nature of play: don't write a bunch of combat rules for a game about, say, a family being torn apart by a messy divorce; likewise, don't eschew rules for doing damage, destruction, and mortification if the game is about race relations in the Dirty Old South. (I.E. "System Matters" in Nar.)<br/><br/>I do NOT think scene framing is key, nor do I think a GM is key (see below), though an organizer/writer would be required, obviously.\n<blockquote>is there such a thing as a GM-less / GM-ful LARP?</blockquote>\nGM-less: sure, common as rain. You'd still have an organizer (logistics) and possibly a writer (initial situation framing and character design), but once you Play On, a GM's only real functions would be rules resolution (which is often not needed, in smooth systems) or playing NPCs (again, not necessary to all game types) or presenting aspects of a scene/situation which are non-present (e.g. describing "what you see"). So to remove those functions, don't make a complex, interwoven rule system; don't require a bunch of characters to support your players, in the plot concept; and take the time to setup WYSIWYG staging, props, and environments.<br/><br/>As for GM-full: sure, common as rain. Flip most of the above "don't's" to make "do's". A heavily plotted stories without the troupe budget to support WYSIWYG, "line-course" or module play, a lot of supporting cast, a lot of "secrets" which aren't in the hands of PCs in play, a "metagame" or "side game" of strategy and resource management: all of these elements contribute to a heavy GM involvement both during play and between session (in on-going games).<br/><br/>In closing, you might want to take this question (with some expansion of what you mean by "story-game"--avoid jargon!) to RPG.net's Live Action forum. There are a lot of serious, life-long LARPers and designers there who could help you flesh-out a roadmap or find more resources to get at the "storified" LARP notion you seem to be pursuing.<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155697/#Comment_155697" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T14:39:24+00:00" title="July  9, 2008  2:39PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks for all the replies guys!<br/><br/>this is very helpful<br/><br/>I did mean Nar when I said story-games<br/><br/>and yeah, I knew Jeep was probably the answer<br/><br/>but I'm having trouble finding anyone who knows what Jeep-Form is here in Paris, so I was wondering if perhaps there were some other options out there<br/><br/><b>A Flower For Mara </b>might definitely be it<br/><br/>when will it be for sale?<br/><br/>back on the topic of Jeep, with the ammunition you guys gave me, I might be able to convince some of the LARP-folk around here to give it a try<br/><br/>as to writing my own stuff, I think that'll have to wait, but thanks for the analysis anyway <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155698/#Comment_155698" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T14:44:54+00:00" title="July  9, 2008  2:44PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hoog</cite><b>A Flower For Mara</b>might definitely be it<br/><br/>when will it be for sale?</blockquote>\nIt'll release officially this GenCon, though I'll probably make it available via Lulu as soon as I get a proof I'm happy with.

Jeepform is a collection of techniques that has no specific relevance to narrativist role-playing - it can support that or other styles.</blockquote>\nI would say this like this: as I said in my post, not all Jeepform scenarios are narrativist. Jeepform IS a collection of techniques, but is a "design philosophy" too that require a premise to be addressed. This, by itself, doesn't make a game "narrativist" (in some Jeepform games the theme, the way to address the premise, is hard-wired in the game - i. e., "the mothers"), but it's all the pieces you need.<br/><br/>I mean, these techniques, and that design philosophy, is enough to be able to create (if you want) games that are very good in provoking a narrativist kind of play (with Doubt, for example, you play narrativist or you don't play at all).  It's the "costruction Kit" that I believed was missing from LARPS.<br/><br/>Other kind of LARPS can be used for narrativist playing (I am thinking, for example, about what are called "dramatist" games), but I saw them not so much as "narrativist-provoking" than as "not-narrativist-denying", they allow narrativist playing by not contrasting it. (a good example would be the very simple <a href="http://fate.laiv.org/dogme99/en/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Dogma99</a> game "<a href="http://fate.laiv.org/dogme99/en/larp1.htm" rel="nofollow">13 at the table</a>", that can be easily played narrativist... if all the people at the table want to play it that way, and that I was _never_ able to play narrativist because every time I played it or any variant of it, everybody was too busy in being "realistic" and "play his/her character" and did shoot down every try to get some story injected in the event, turning the event every time in a "slice of life" without any real story)<br/><br/>Compare this with, for example, what happened at a playing of "doubt" last year at an Italian convention. I wasn't a player (I already played it the year before) but I wanted to see the game because this time Tobias Wrigstad was running it and I wanted so see how he did it. It was a very, very good session, with very good players (both italians and jeepformers). At the end of the game I talked to one of the Italian players to congratulate him, but he wasn't happy. I asked why, they were so good I would have applauded their performance on the stage if hadn't been worried about disturbing them. And he answered me that he did like the game very much, and the other players played very well, but he wasn't happy about HIS performance. Why? Because, he did say, he wasn't able to "stay in character". The story was so gripping, and touched so much many personal issues, that after a while he played the character reacting as he would have done himself. Reacting in a personal way. (he did play  "close to home", I would say. That is the point of the game after all)<br/><br/>He was a player so very used to playing "simulating a character", that he did interpreter playing in a narrativist way as "bad playing"... and he couldn't help himself doing so at that game, to the point of playing a VERY GOOD narrativist game, against his wishes!  (or his habits, if you prefer)<br/><br/>It's a lot like the effect games like DitV or TSOY (with keys) or PTA have on players used to more "traditional" rpgs, and I did want something that had the same effect with LARPS.<br/><br/>P.S. David, about the scene framing issue... the issue is having a single SIS. You can do it using scene framing, or you can do it keeping everybody together in a very little single space (for example, in 13 at the table, a single table where everybody can hear what the other are saying).  In more traditional LARPS where people can play far from each others, there isn't a single "story" that can be perceived by all the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155802/#Comment_155802" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T09:14:29+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  9:14AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2008 9:15AM by David Artman.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>It's the "construction Kit" that I believed was missing from LARPS.</blockquote>Ahem...

I just meant it wasn't required, not that it doesn't work to push theme/story.<br/><br/>In "wander-around LARPs" GMs often use some method to cause the players to gather when "the plot" starts to roll out. Sometimes a bit hand-wavy, oftentimes optional (in continuing campaigns), occasionally scheduled (e.g. module runs)--but not requisite. As a fast-and-loose example: a "story" about a pending invasion of orcs could be initially presented by a pack of (NPC) wolves starting to harry the town/commons, because the approaching orc invaders are eating all their food sources (or scaring them off). The "theme" in such an encounter--particularly if one can leverage, say, a "nature class" or faction, like Druids--is that these ravening wolves are not, in fact, the real enemy but are precursors--foreshadowing, if one can figure out the clues (why are they only NOW bothering the village?) or out-right plot advancement, if one can speak with animals.<br/><br/>OK, ok, that's week--not much theme there other than "don't kill the messenger"--but it is in no way a framed scene (rather, I'd call it an on-going event or situation), nor is it centralized (the wolf pack could be ranging all over the play space).<br/><br/>And that, by the way, is Actual Play from a LARP I was in years ago: I was the Alpha of the pack, working isolate-and-surround pack tactics with other players; and I was very much instructed to drop hints and clues, via physical descriptions to "What Do I See?" ("A large but scrawny-looking wolf!") and via eventual conversation with the touchy-feely, tree-hugging Druid and Fae factions. I'd call that story, I see a theme (not Earth-shattering or tear-jerking, but a theme), and I don't see a framed scene, a schedule (beyond "do this all afternoon"), nor a central location (we were stalking all the less-frequented spot of the campsite, hoping to catch some slacker wandering to their cabin alone). Hey! That actually points out a meta-theme: the organizers, in part, wanted to keep players from becoming lackadaisical during the "slow times" of the afternoon, because folks tended not to take conflicts at those times seriously, because they "knew" the scheduled field battle would be when all the NPCs would be signed up, rather than "used up" (it was a routine duty for all players) by being scattered throughout the day. So, BAM! Theme and meta-game prod, which in turn made for a meta-theme ("you are never really safe; travel in groups!").<br/><br/>Anyhow... rambling, as AP stuff can lead to. I think I made my basic point: scene framing = useful and common... but not requisite with all plot techniques.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156717/#Comment_156717" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-15T12:48:20+00:00" title="July 15, 2008 12:48PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I've found at least one person willing to try Jeep-Form<br/><br/>now I need to set up a game<br/><br/>I've looked through the games on the Jeep site, wondering which one would be best suited for total beginners<br/><br/>I'm thinking "Drunk", but I'd like to hear your advice<br/><br/>please <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>once that's decided, I'll naturally have lots of questions about the game itself <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156727/#Comment_156727" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-15T13:07:16+00:00" title="July 15, 2008  1:07PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, I have never played "Drunk", and I have never played a Jeepform with less than 5 people.

What really did blow my mind was playing <i>Doubt</i>, afterward, in Italian. It's really a masterpiece, and still the best larp I have ever played.<br/><br/><i>The Upgrade</i> problem, in my opinion, is that, being a demonstrative larp, require someone fluent with jeepform, who demonstrate it. The GM have to be really quick-thinking, too, because it's very fast and furious (you have six or more players that can add anything to any scene at any moment by simply going on stage and begin a flashback or flash forward scene or saying out loud what another character is thinking). If you have someone who can GM it, ok, go for it, but I wouldn't suggest it to a group where you haven't someone that already played it.<br/><br/><i>Doubt</i> is much more forgiving, nobody must be particular quick or knowledgeable to play it, and it's the Larp that _never_ fail, after having seen it played more than a few time even with people who never larped before. But has a different kind of requirement: trust between the people who play and a willingness to play "close to home", as in "close to your true self", a story about love, trust and betrayal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157180/#Comment_157180" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T11:21:41+00:00" title="July 17, 2008 11:21AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>At the end of the game I talked to one of the Italian players to congratulate him, but he wasn't happy.

You will never be able to "stay in character" unless you find something that links <b>you</b> to that character, allowing you to understand and "feel" him.<br/><br/>Then you find this kind of people, who believe that they "didn't stay in character" just because they connected the feelings to their own. Who is to really tell them that their character would not feel stuff the same way they do?<br/><br/>Of course, if you are talking about Meta-gaming, that is another different matter...

I asked why, they were so good I would have applauded their performance on the stage if hadn't been worried about disturbing them. And he answered me that he did like the game very much, and the other players played very well, but he wasn't happy about HIS performance. Why? Because, he did say, he wasn't able to "stay in character". The story was so gripping, and touched so much many personal issues, that after a while he played the character reacting as he would have done himself. Reacting in a personal way. (he did play  "close to home", I would say. That is the point of the game after all)</blockquote>\nI always find this kind of things amusing.<br/><br/>You see, I studied drama at some point. During several years. With a couple of professional actors as my teachers. And one of the first things they told me was "Feel it and the audience will feel it."<br/><br/>Their acting school was that in order to be able to act as your character, you have to connect it to<b>your own</b>experiences. You will never be able to "stay in character" unless you find something that links<b>you</b>to that character, allowing you to understand and "feel" him.<br/><br/>Then you find this kind of people, who believe that they "didn't stay in character" just because they connected the feelings to their own.

But this does not seem to be the case.<br/><br/>See, if I were to say something like that, I would not be talking about the strength of my performance towards an audience, but about how much I was able to push myself into being someone else for awhile.  Playing someone totally alien is so difficult it would likely be impossible for me, but at the same time that is my goal when I attempt what I end up calling "immersion".  So if the game made it too easy to just be yourself and not someone else then I could see the person not having as good a time, because it wasn't what he wanted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157940/#Comment_157940" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-22T14:08:10+00:00" title="July 22, 2008  2:08PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the thing is that it is not the same to not being able to feel or think in a way you (as yourself) are not used to, than to say that your <b>performance</b> was not good because you did relate to it.
