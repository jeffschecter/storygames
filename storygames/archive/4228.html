The game was loosely structured, and the first scene was fun (for me at least, I don't know if it was for anyone else).  The scene was described by the GM on a web page.  We added things that we either said or did.  Other folks reacted, and overall, while maybe a little chaotic, it was interactive.<br/><br/>Then one of the folks and the GM talked, and the whole system changed.  Now there is no general page that encapsulates what is going on.  Instead we have individual pages where the GM describes what we see and hear, and we tell the GM what we do.  We have to submit our next moves every Tuesday, and he updates our page on Friday with what happened.  <br/><br/>So let's say somehting happens in the fiction on Friday.  I want to talk to one of the PC's about it.  I post something on Tuesday initiating the conversation.  The GM let's the other PC know that a conversation has started on Friday.  The PC responds back to GM on Tuesday.  I get his reponse on Friday.  And so on.  This really seems to kill any hope for interaction between PC's.<br/><br/>I think that the group really wants to have fun playing this, and the GM is very accepting of new ideas/ways to make this work.  My problem is that this is my first PBP and I don't know how it is suppose to work or what are guidelines for making the game run well.<br/><br/>Can anybody help a fellow out?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94724/#Comment_94724" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T12:01:02+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 12:01PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's way too slow of a system. It's good, because it lets him take everything that people want to do and mesh it into a single narrative, but it's going to wind up driving people away if used in every situation. I think it would work great for running combats, but that conversations and other social interactions should either not use it at all, or have the deadline sped way up. Otherwise scenes will drag out way longer than they should in real time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94732/#Comment_94732" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T12:17:13+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 12:17PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well it sounds like - and I may be way off here - like you have one or two specific issues, likely. I'm basing this observation off having played the way that you've played (using Wikis with no GM, in fact), and having had it work just fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the GM may feel that the game is out of his control, wanting to have control over the narrative. If this is the case, then it may be that you and your GM just want very different things out of play. The only way to be sure is to ask him why he made the change. If he can articulate it, then maybe you can work towards some sort of compromise solution that works for everyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, that one player talking to the GM (or him and the GM) could be overwhelmed by the pace. A lot of times in PBP games one or more players dominates play, because they simply have more time and/or energy to post. This is just a fact of life with asynch play, however, and slowing everyone down to allow everyone to keep pace is probably not the best idea. The rate of play being as slow as it is anyhow. Like James says above, if I had to play only one post a week, that'd suck. Oh, to be sure there are games that I play at more slowly than that at times. But I'd prefer if I weren't artificially limited when I had time. So I can catch up when I am available, as opposed to times when I have limited time and energy to post. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I may have missed by a mile here... but if I have, telling me where I'm wrong may help us nail down the problem. Which is key to giving you some solutions. I have loads of ideas about how you *could* play. But only one of those will fit your actual needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20M" title="Robert M"><img alt="Robert M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20M">Robert M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94763/#Comment_94763" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T12:54:32+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 12:54PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first observation is spot on.  The GM wants/feels compelled to have control over the narrative.  I just don't know which.  My ambiguity is because of an important piece of information that I left out that addresses your second observation.<br/><br/>The "other" player is a fellow who is notorious for the "Hey look at me, I've got a secret" style of play.  I am fairly confidant that the conversation between them consisted of, "but how am I suppose to sneak around doing things behind the other players' backs if everything is out in the open?"<br/><br/>I don't care much for this style of play (in case my characterization didn't make my feelings clear), but I am fine with him playing this way.  If it makes the game fun for him, than I am willing to roll with it.  But I think the GM's solution to his desired play is forcing us into a very structured GM controlled narrative that I am not interested in.<br/><br/>I want the game and story to be a little more collaborative with each of us contributing elements and details to the play.  I want there to be back and forth between characters and ideas bounced around.  And this format doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t seem to allow for much of this kind of play.<br/><br/>Whether the pace of the play was overwhelming, I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know.  There were some 4-5 posts made, one each by the players over a 3 day period.  I think we basically each posted something and then waited to see what the others had to contribute.  Adding some structure to this makes all the sense in the world.  I just don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know what the structure should be.<br/><br/>Thanks for the help.<br/><br/>P.S. I left out the \xe2\u20ac\u0153other\xe2\u20ac\x9d player information because I really don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want that to color my feelings about the rest of the group or trying to find a way to have a positive play experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94786/#Comment_94786" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T13:23:28+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  1:23PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2007 1:23PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, enlightening. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, that said... you're playing with the other players. You have to consider them and how they play, or will react to the method of play. It's simply not something you can do in a vaccuum. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you may be hosed here. Put into perspective, you're simply not playing the way the rest of the group (well part of it anyhow), is interested in playing. I can't think of a way to satisfy all of these players simultaneously. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou're recourse here, it seems to me, is to just suggest the method of play in which you are interested in playing. That is, indicate to the GM what it is that you'd like to see, as opposed to what is going on. Don't talk theory or any of that, or condemn anything that they're doing, just put in positive terms what it is that you'd like to see in play. Like character secrets being visible to all of the players, for instance. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey might just get it, and decide to try it out. Or maybe not. But give it a try.

My hope was to find a set of PBP guidelines that generally moved the game to a more collaborative style of play, introduce them as an alternative to the current system and discuss why they interest me.  I just have never played in a PBP before, so I don't have firm examples of things I think work, and why.<br/><br/>And I'm not trying to stamp out the "other" player's fun.  It's not my style, but oh well.  But I think the GM in addressing his concern swung the pendulum too far the other way.  I am looking for another PBP structure that will find the middle ground.  I already know that my style may not mesh with the groups, but I don't know that for a fact yet.  I am trying to find a positive way to discuss these rules without it turning into "I don't like this rule because of X and Y."  I would rather approach it from "Here is an alternate rule that hopefully accomplishes X and Y."<br/><br/>Any general framework you think might work, or am I on a fool's errand?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95272/#Comment_95272" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T16:13:33+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  4:13PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well in a PBEM I'm in, almost all posts go to an open list and anything that needs to stay secret gets dealt with in private email.  On a message board, I'd probably have everyone post to a main thread and any secret stuff goes to PM or whispered posts.  Though, something I discovered about this open list format is that the characters still have secrets but now we all get to enjoy them.  My own secret became much more fun when I revealed it.  If your GM is worried about posts getting away from him, have him stick with his strict posting schedule and limit PC posts in between unless there are only PC's in the thread so you can have PC-PC conversations without bogging down the rest of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95532/#Comment_95532" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T12:40:26+00:00" title="September 13, 2007 12:40PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2007 1:36PM by DannyK.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a good friend back in my Vampire-fanatic days who ran a bunch of PBP games that worked by having different sub-forums for each location, and you'd jump around from forum to forum as your character moved.  The games inevitably bogged down and ran out of steam, maybe because it was too difficult to keep track of what your fellow players were doing.  <br/><br/>The structure the original poster mentioned sounds almost like that of an old-school Flying Buffalo play-by-mail game.  I think most of those games were turn-based strategy games, with interaction between players only at the borders of territories.  <br/><br/>What I've found to work best as both a player and a GM is to have two threads, IC and OOC.  I suppose it wouldn't hurt to have multiple IC threads, but that makes it significantly more difficult to keep on top of the game and you're not as likely to follow what's happening with other players, which really hurts the game for all kinds of reasons.  <br/><br/>I also like to use a looser approach to posting, so that you post a bit of internal dialogue or business along with your "move".  That seems to raise the bandwidth greatly.  I've also been in games where it was part of accepted practice to post interactions with one's pet NPC's, flashbacks, diary entries, etc,. particularly during lulls between scenes.<br/><br/>EDIT: Author Stance.

It's nice, for what it is, but it's not a PBEM game, really, it's a format for PBEM games.  Basically, the idea is that every reply in a given scene should neatly incorporate everything that's gone before, so that the final post of the scene provides a tidy summary of the scene for the archives.    It's an interesting concept, but I can't imagine using the full thing in a game.  <br/><br/>I'd love to hear about other people's experiences with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw" title="Southpaw"><img alt="Southpaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://his.randomscribbling.com/ds/wp-content/uploads/JonahHex1sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw">Southpaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102943/#Comment_102943" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T17:32:10+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  5:32PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Danny, it's funny that you picked up <i>Quest</i>, too.  I mentioned it to my wife and, next thing you know, I had a freshly purchased copy in my mailbox.<br/><br/>For everyone else: I guess the best way to describe <i>Quest</i> is as a meta-system.  It presents a fairly rigid <i>format</i> within which the game is moved forward.  Sprawling threads, overlapping time-frames and the generally messiness of PBeM are all addressed in the way emails are presented.  I think using it would take some acclimation for all involved, but it would be worthwhile in the way it keeps things organized.<br/><br/>I wish there was a way to explain more explicitly <i>how</i> it all works without simply giving away what Forever People ask $2.50 for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102965/#Comment_102965" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T03:40:34+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  3:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh hey, I can't believe I missed this!  Check out <a href="http://snailspace.forgreatjustice.net/" rel="nofollow">Snail's Pace</a>, a forum for indie PBP.  There are some pretty interesting games being played there, and a bit of discussion about how to best adapt/design for PBP.  I guess I share your feeling that there's a lot of untapped awesome in PBP, but we're not always getting to it at the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
