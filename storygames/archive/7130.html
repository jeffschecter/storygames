Treachery from within? Well somebody had to get the Death Star Plans out...<br/>Lots of Star Wars action takes place on the ground (for little or no reason).. the key here is a scene where the characters are ambushed by bad guys. This could easily be moved to a spaceship run through an asteroid belt or through the center of a watery planet...<br/>Or through the planet-wide city of Coruscant! There's got to be plenty of places to ambush people in those high-tech canyons.<br/><br/>Not bad...<br/>Let's mix it up a bit.<br/>Space Opera<br/>Warhammer 40k: There Will be War<br/>Shakespeare<br/>Pulp: High Adventure in Exotic Locales<br/><br/>A daring young explorer, fresh from her stint at the academy, eager to prove herself and taking on all comers.<br/>Heavy weapons troops, barraging a fortified enemy.<br/>A prince, arrogant and vain, rash of thought and too hasty to action.<br/>A seedy bar, with a dangerous client\xe8le.<br/><br/>This one is even easier!<br/>The "daring young explorer" and the arrogant prince sound like great Star Wars personas, and it shouldn't be hard to work them into most any story.<br/>Heavy weapons troops.. we are talking Star WARS here. A grim battle is fitting for either the Clone Wars or Rebellion Era.<br/>A seedy bar, with... OK this one is TOO easy. <br/><br/>Well, I'm satisfied.<br/>I think I know what my Thursday night group will be doing next week. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159456/#Comment_159456" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T12:57:03+00:00" title="July 29, 2008 12:57PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mix-and-match oracles... I like it. At Trinoc*coN this weekend, I had to "modernize" the default Oracles on the fly, to help hook in some younger players (SR4 fanatics: drugs, gear, and crunch--HOORAY!).<br/><br/>I found it remarkably easy, as you seem to have found with repurposing varied (and sometimes seemingly odd--Shakespeare? Brilliant!) Oracles sets. I just thought I'd mention that you can "file off the time period" on a lot of them and get close to any genre, as well. The supernatural elements, though... well, they need further expansion or reinterpreting ("ghosts, demons, spirits" - real or fake? World of Darkness or Scooby Doo?).<br/><br/>I'm also keen to try having players each come up with one Oracle; or using random news headlines as Oracles; and of course, song lyrics... <img alt="&gt;:)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/naughty.png" title="&gt;:)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
