                    I created <i>Iliamna Unknown</i> for Jason Morningstarâ€™s <i>Undead Software Engineers in Alaska contest</i> and played it for the first time tonight. Surprisingly, it worked with a few changes needed. You can get <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Iliamna_Unknown.php" rel="nofollow"><i>Iliamna Unknown</i>  here</a>. <br/><br/>My significant other and I played. It worked very nicely as a two person game - I didn't think it would. About my SO: She's played only a few rpgs: <i>Breaking the Ice, InSpectres</i>, <i>My Secret Waitress</i> and now this one. She's had problems with role-playing games before, but this one was easier for her, because as she put it, the rules are easier and she didnâ€™t have to talk too much or role-play too much. This I found interesting, because she had a real hard time with BtI.<br/><br/>We played this game using mostly descriptions and very little role-playing with the characters. For example, one thing in chapter one I narrated was, "As we're traveling up the river, the ice breaks and we fall through, I quickly pull a rope out of my pack and use it to pull us out of the cold water." For her next turn, she narrated, "We build a fire to get warm and dry out our clothing."<br/><br/>The game played out in just under an hour and we played using the 10 token version, which is the smallest number of tokens per player allowed in the rules. If you haven't seen the game, it works by players narrating things that happen during the first two chapters and each thing is powered with one or more tokens, then the players narrate how the spirit world changes those things, and finally, as the engineers descend into their madness, they consume those things and become more powerful, then they finally try to catch the Iliamna monster. Everything is resolved via the hand game.<br/><br/>What was really fun:<br/><br/>Playing the Hand Game was a blast. It really added to the fun, because you had to try and fool the other player. It added a bit of mystery and luck to the game. The narration went very quickly and the story was created quickly. It was a simple and fast game. The tokens, sticky-notes and the hand game made this a very physical game, and moving the sticky notes around and marking them up was fun.<br/><br/>What didn't work: <br/><br/>1. When we removed a things last token via the Hand Game, there really was no point to try to consume it. So, the new rule to fix it:<br/><br/><i>If the last token is removed from a thing, it disappears from play. There must be at least two things per player on the table after chapter two.</i><br/><br/>2. And in Consuming and Distorting, you can get tokens via the Hand Game with no risk. So, the new rule to fix this is: <br/><br/><i>You can only get tokens via the Hand Game in the Consuming and Distorting when you don't have enough tokens to try to consume or distort.</i><br/><br/>3. The Distorting takes way too long. It needs to play in half the time. To fix this the new rule is: <br/><br/><i>If she loses: the thing is distorted, counters spent are added half to the thing, half to the center of the table.</i><br/><br/>The narrative went like this:<br/><br/>Character Creation:<br/><br/>Me: tak'elashen â€“ 'priest'<br/>Her: nuti â€“ 'salt'<br/><br/>Chapter One: Traveling up the Kvichak River.<br/><br/>First, we fell through the ice and saved with a rope from my pack, then (2) Ilena started a fire for warmth. (3) After we warmed a pack of wolves followed us in the distance. (4) And we traveled up the river on the ice, until (5) we found an old boat, half frozen but with gas, which we dug out of the ice and pulled behind us on the ice.<br/><br/>Chapter Two: Setting up camp.<br/><br/>Once at camp, (1) Ilena turned the boat into a shelter, and (2) I shot a rabbit with for dinner. (3) The wolf pack showed up again and we ran it off, then (4) we tanned the rabbit hide for mittens for the long winter to come. (5) After which the tents and cots were set-up for the night. (6) In the middle of the night the Northern Lights made an appearance and everyone was happy under them.<br/><br/>Chapter Three: The spirits world emergences from a hole in the ice.<br/><br/>The distorting starts. (1) The boat becomes a whale. (2) The mittens become hand eaters. (3) The tents and shelters become tattered ghosts blowing in the wind. (4) The Northern Lights spread as a green fire in the wood. (5) The fire burns bright in the sky as a moon. (6) The rope becomes a giant winter white snake. (7) The wolves become tall pure white human like creatures. (8) The gas combusts into a giant fire monster. (9) The rest drop out of the game.<br/><br/>Chapter Four: The Consuming<br/><br/>After the spirits emerge, the characters are taken over by their word chosen in character creation, this word wants to consume the world. And the 'clear after a storm,' 'anciently long ago,' and the Iliamna monster also want to consume the world. <br/><br/>I consumed an army of things following my 'priest' like unholy warriors of the following numbers above: 2, 3, 7, and 8. Ilena got the (1) whale, which turned the water to salt, the (4) Northern Lights which burst into salt flames making the land barren. Iliamna monster ate 6 and 'anciently long ago' got 5.<br/><br/>End Game:<br/><br/>My go, I front tokens to get Ilena's Dinchin-du â€“ her character's word. I lose the tokens. She goes after my Dinchin-du and wins. I have no tokens, so my priest is drown in a pile of salt and my minions turn to follow her. She takes on 'clear after a storm' and wins. She washes the earth clean with her salt. She goes after 'anciently long ago' and fails. The ancient earth spirits rise out of the earth sweeping away the salt. She goes after the Iliamna monster and loses. The monster breaks through the ice and swallows everything whole.<br/><br/>We answer: did the players bring home a big fish or a big fish story?<br/><br/>A big fish story.                </div>

                            Thanks, Jason. I just couldn't help but give it a try, and when Ilena actually said, "Yes, I'll play," I jumped right on that. The tokens and hand game were the big draw for me. It's nice that the game actually worked -- for the most part.                        </div>
