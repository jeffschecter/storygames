I tend to play and run "traditional" games like Savage Worlds, etc. However, I know there are a group of story-game techniques/mechanics for improving game fun that appear to work regardless of whether the game is a story-game or not. For example, Scene Framing works well regardless of the game mechanic (in general).<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there an inventory some where of such techniques? I get some of them from the Shark Bones podcast, but they're not heavily Story Gamed.

Then you won't accidentally lose something good or pick up something terrible if you start using other techniques, distributing the power/responsibility elsewhere.<br/><br/>The main advantage of a GM in a game like Savage Worlds is that of a singular vision, a creative director. You're not designing a campaign by committee, where everything is the blandest possible accommodation of all the collaborative players all being nice to each other and supporting each other's contributions even if they aren't super excited about them.  They can hate what you make or love it, but however they feel about it, they feel it about something you made.  That is highly satisfying for both GM and player.<br/><br/>Collaborative games gain the ability to accommodate many creative visions, and they ensure that I as a player can impose my view of what I want to see my character cope with on some level.  If I think a character's family issues are the most important thing, I can make sure those family issues come up even if everyone else thinks it's boring as hell.  This is a good thing, because it means fidelity to character is extremely tight.  I'm never sitting on a dramatic revelation about my character or their life, waiting for the GM to give me the right moment, or I tell him what I want and it's not quite right for the revelation and it turns out to be a dud. I get to have the moments I want, I get to have the play I desire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325978/#Comment_325978" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T16:44:16+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  4:44PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2011 4:49PM by johnzo.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Gary--<br/><br/>I don't see "keys" listed on that wiki page, so I'll do a little bit on 'em here.<br/><br/>Briefly, keys are a mechanism by which players award themselves experience when their characters do things that are iconic / appropriate / fun  for their character or genre.  Lady Blackbird and The Shadow of Yesterday both use keys.  (google those games, they're both free and a lot of fun!) <br/><br/>I think that Keys are pretty easy to graft onto more 'traditional' games.  Let's take Star Wars as an example.  In Star Wars, it's totally appropriate for Jedi to be tempted by the Dark Side.  So if you were playing a Savage Worlds Jedi, you could have a Key of Dark Side Temptation that awarded a bennie every time your character flirted with the Dark Side. <br/><br/>Keys could be linked with Savage Worlds Hindrances as well, rewarding the player for engaging the Hindrance.  A Keyed Hindrance like Bloodthirsty, Habit, etc could reward with a bennie whenever the PC takes a game penalty from that hindrance.  <br/><br/>I've got a post-apocalyptic action movie Savage Worlds hack that I will run someday that uses keys like:<br/><br/>Key of Rock n' Roll! +1 Bennie if you run out of ammo using autofire<br/>Key of M*A*S*H: +1 Bennie if you heal someone under fire<br/>Key of the Deer-Eyed Rookie: +1 Bennie if you're Shaken                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325979/#Comment_325979" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T16:47:03+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  4:47PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There isn't really an inventory.<br/><br/>Try reading the GM sections of games.

If you want to suggest a style of play for a pregen, a Key is hot stuff!<br/><br/>2) Keys are flags, they tell the GM what the player is interested in.  If I'm the GM and a player chooses the Key of Dark Side Temptation, I know they're interested in exploring the Dark Side, and I can prepare my scenarios with that in mind.<br/><br/>3) Keys are player empowering.  If I run a Jedi with the Key of Dark Side Temptation, I don't have to wait for the GM to offer an opportunity for me to engage my Dark Side story.  I can seek out those opportunities, or perhaps inject my story into places the GM didn't anticipate.<br/><br/>4) Keys push the initiative onto the players.  If I'm the GM and I have a table full of players who are rocking their keys, then I don't have to lead then through the scenario by the nose.  My job is just to roll with their punches.  For me, that provides a more natural feeling game, where the scenario is truly the intersection of the GM's preparation and the player's destabilizing impulses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326175/#Comment_326175" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T13:25:46+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  1:25PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keys/Aspects are also a really good way to transition from thinking about mechanics to thinking about story.  A lot of "trad" games train players to look for their +2 flanking bonus, or +1 height advantage, or +2 cover bonus.  Keys are a good intermediate step to get those players to think "where can I get my +2 bonus (by incorporating this story element)?"  From there, it's a short step to just "where can I incorporate this story element?"<br/><br/>Conversely, they can ease some of the systemic penalties that a lot of games put on players for doing something non-optimal.  Sure, I'm giving up my cover bonus by running in guns blazing, but I'm Brash, so the Fate Point makes up for it somewhat.<br/><br/>They can also really smooth interactions between players who are looking for even slightly different things from the game.  A more story focused player and a more game focused player both end up pushing for the same stuff.  Even if they see different elements as the primary goal and the side effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326200/#Comment_326200" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T15:24:39+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  3:24PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Refresh scenes, also ala Lady Blackbird.<br/><br/>I'm running a Savage World campaign (Slipstream) and am going crazy with the other players only wanting to fly to the next fragment/get more loot to trade/the next clue/next ally/next fight.

The basic form of most rules-of-the-day is that the players can perform an action or set a short flashback scene or cut scene to specifically support the theme, and get a bonus. That bonus mostly takes the form of a d4 to add on top of an already rolled d20, out of combat. It can be for immediate use or it can be put in the bank for use later in the session.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample: It's part of the premise of the game that Our Heroes are Rogues with Hearts of Gold. So far they had tended to group into rogues and gold hearts, so for one session, I set up a rule-of-the-day that said each player could get two bonuses for the session: One for acting roguishly, one for showing some heart of gold. The adversity was ramped up to make sure that most players would need both before the day was done. To get the bonus, you had to give your actions an appropriate twist, and the bonus was immediate.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly, when the bonus is banked, one player can have only one bonus banked, or there's a limit on how many you can get, like in the example.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just an example of a way to add story game techniques to a "traditional" game, in this case turning each session into a sort of focused little story-subgame of it's own. This particular approach relies on quite heavy GM control of the direction of the game, sort of like the control that authors have over most story games. We've had a lot of fun with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326281/#Comment_326281" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T07:23:51+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  7:23AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>In all fairness, I've had a number of weird adventures IRL that started off after having met someone in a bar...</blockquote>\nIf any of them involved killing orcs and taking their stuff, I want pictures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326286/#Comment_326286" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T07:44:26+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  7:44AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>In all fairness, I've had a number of weird adventures IRL that started off after having met someone in a bar...</blockquote>\nIf any of them involved killing orcs and taking their stuff, I want pictures.<br/><br/>No, but a couple of them have involved a bartender getting me work with an old geezer after I'd run up a rather large bar tab, so that part at least seems right on...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326484/#Comment_326484" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T10:55:17+00:00" title="May 26, 2011 10:55AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>In all fairness, I've had a number of weird adventures IRL that started off after having met someone in a bar...</blockquote>\nIf any of them involved killing orcs and taking their stuff, I want pictures.<br/><br/>No, but a couple of them have involved a bartender getting me work with an old geezer after I'd run up a rather large bar tab, so that part at least seems right on...<br/><br/>An old geezer, or THE Old Geezer?

Example: The character is a drunk and this is a time when being a drunk will make tension and focus the story around it. Offer a bennie for it.
