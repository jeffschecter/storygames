Screw hit points; combat should whittle down <em>resolve</em>.</blockquote>\nHit Points could be said to represent resolve already.  Unless anyone believes someone can receive the worst wound hit from an axe a dozen times over and survive, just because they have lots of "experience".<br/>It's all in the narration.<br/><br/>I don't think I made myself clear, and I don't want to further threadjack the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3889" rel="nofollow">Two-Weapon Fighting thread</a>.  So.<br/><br/>Hit points do not represent a character's resolve.  They're a counter for how long a character can stay in play.  Sure, you could narrate however you like, but I don't know about you, but my resolve fluctuates a lot without being hit with an axe.<br/><br/>Using resolve instead of hit points would mean that feints, intimidation, being outnumbered, and the badguy revealing terrible things about your friends would all reduce your resolve... as well as being hit with an axe.  Your resolve could increase when you are encouraged, when the tide of battle swings your way, when you suddenly realize you love the woman you're fighting for, or when said woman throws the Sword of Destiny into your hand.<br/><br/>Resolve would track, not your <em>ability</em> to stay in the fight, but your <em>desire</em> to fight in the first place.<br/><br/>I mean, like, priests sitting back there and healing you up as you get beat on with an axe?  Has anybody ever considered how <em>really fucking creepy</em> that is, with big bloody gashes on your body closing up again even as you keep fighting?  How screwed up is that?  Instead, imagine the priest in the back chanting holy prayers, giving you the moral strength to keep fighting -- that makes so much more sense to me, and also seems a whole lot more fun.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88177/#Comment_88177" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T09:21:35+00:00" title="August 15, 2007  9:21AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've also heard it said (or seen it stated) that Hit Points are a rating of how important your character (or the monster's character or the NPC) is to the story.

In the FATE variant I'm working on, my current approach is that blows or shots that don't take you out reduce your Composure. When that's all gone, you can go berserk, or run like a dog, or curl up in a ball, or anything similarly basic. What you can't do is fight tactically, or moderately, or with an eye to self-preservation. Once your Composure is all gone, and you choose to fight, you are staking your character's life. This is horror, mind you.

And it's similar.  Your vitality is the stuff that powers both your "parrying" abilities (you have a separate Defense stat that is analogous to "dodging") in a fight and your Force abilities.  Whenever your opponent gets past your Defense, you lose Vitality.  Whenever you use a Force ability you lose Vitality.  When you run out of Vitality, you are open to losing Hit Points.  <br/><br/>Personally, I think it works really well, but perhaps the system should be opened up a little to include other factors besides "parrying" and "magic."  Obviously Obi-wan lost the will to finish off Anakin at the end of their fight.  Why?  Pity caused a lose of Vitality (or resolve).  So, this isn't a new idea, but one that perhaps hasn't been developed to it's potential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88624/#Comment_88624" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T15:19:01+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  3:19PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2007 9:54PM by noclue.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Obi wan didn't lose.
