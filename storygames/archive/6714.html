I'm a little put-off by releasing too much before the actual playtest pdf, but I want to start a thread for it anyway. I'll put a couple of snapshots of the current clean page layout and post the first mechanic of the game here for now. The short intro of the game is in the snapshots btw.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically its a lot like Blade Runner meets Ghost in the Shell in a dark room, get it on, and have RPG babies. One RPG baby boy gets beat up with a Men in Black stick, and we named him Karbon.<br/>\n<br/>\n(click snapshots for full-size readable images)<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://rpg.wishray.com/karbon/promo/page2full.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="page2thumb.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://rpg.wishray.com/karbon/promo/page2thumb.jpg"/></a> - <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://rpg.wishray.com/karbon/promo/page2introfull.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="page2introthumb.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://rpg.wishray.com/karbon/promo/page2introthumb.jpg"/></a><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>&gt;&gt; Comradery &lt;&lt; a common mechanic</b><br/>\n<i>One can\u2019t put a price on one\u2019s comrades, unless they turn out to be karbons,<br/>\nthen they are a 25,000 credit bonus each, receivable at mission pickup.<br/>\n* Veteran Agent Digger</i><br/>\n<br/>\nIn the fiction, comradery is the bonding of agents through their exploits, personal or professional, most revolving around their actions in service of the program. As a mechanic, it\u2019s a matter of recalling some famous or personal history of another player\u2019s agent. In turn this allows that player to spend a character point (either standards or agency) and pick one or more excellencies that fit the recalled events. This can be done at any time in a scene, but its most effective at the beginning of the game since you have access to the excellencies right away. Obviously this results in a trade of flexibility, because doing this later when you need it lets you have just the abilities you need to overcome some challenge. You can never have your agent recall some interesting anecdote for themselves, only for other an agent of another player. Here is what I mean, as comradery presents itself in the game.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">(Bob is playing agent Scarlet, Maggie is playing agent Castle)<br/>\n. . .<br/>\nMaggie: Agent Castle sits down next to Scarlet at the bar. She looks over at Scarlet and looks deep in thought for a moment. \u201cHey, I remember you. You are the one that took out all those resistance fighters on the second moon of the third colony!\u201d<br/>\nBob: Agent Scarlet smiles, \u201cWhy yes I did. Single-handedly no less with my trusty Zeppelin model hand pulse blaster.\u201d<br/>\nMaggie: Agent Castle has some awe on her face. \u201cThats incredible, how did you do it?\u201d<br/>\n. . .</div>\n</blockquote>\nThe player who is receiving the comradery, Bob in this case since Scarlet is the target, can decide to either accept it or not. If they accept it, they spend a character point (marking it down as used for this session), and then say the confirmation phrase: \u201c[codename] remembers that.\u201d Then they are free to choose two points of excellencies. A excellency is a trait, skill, talent, or some ability of note for the agent in question. You want to make these excellencies specific and detailed, but that won\u2019t actually limit how they can be applied in play. Write them down on your agent\u2019s journal paper like this, then read them off to the group to let everyone know:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">He/she has excellence with/in [something]. ([points])<br/>\nHe/she has excellent [something]. ([points])</div>\n</blockquote>\nHere is how Bob handles it in a continued example,<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">. . .<br/>\nBob: Scarlet remembers that. *marks off a standards point* *thinks for a minute* Then adds this to his journal:<br/>\n- He has excellence with light pulse blasters at medium or greater range. (2)<br/>\n. . .</div>\n</blockquote>\nBob could just as well had played on with the above conversation, but never used the confirming phrase or spent the points, which would have made for some interesting character building dialog without any mechanical affect. Players don\u2019t have any restrictions on comradery, so its perfectly fine for a player to ask for some comradery out of character. It can happen when they are in a pinch for instance, and really need an excellency. So, lets talk about how these excellencies work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is important to keep in mind that an excellency created from a given instance of comradery must fit inside its fiction. If the person supplying the lead into the comradery was more specific, then you must respect that as a player. This means there is a push and pull in the creation of each excellency between the players involved, in at least a minimal capacity.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and there is a stub (but empty so far) site here: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://rpg.wishray.com/karbon/" rel="nofollow">Karbon</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonP" title="JasonP"><img alt="JasonP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wishray.com/jp/the_penguin.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonP">JasonP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149152/#Comment_149152" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T18:20:28+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  6:20PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A rough draft, barely edited version of chapter one for preview in PDF format (327kb):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://rpg.wishray.com/karbon/promo/KOG08-1-1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Karbon: Omni Group, Chapter One</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149215/#Comment_149215" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T03:26:00+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  3:26AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            seems like this is just my kind of game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>one thing though: I feel that the important bits of the text aren't emphasized enough<br><br>maybe add summary boxes or something?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonP" title="JasonP"><img alt="JasonP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wishray.com/jp/the_penguin.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonP">JasonP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149319/#Comment_149319" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T11:46:16+00:00" title="June 10, 2008 11:46AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for taking the time to look it over!
