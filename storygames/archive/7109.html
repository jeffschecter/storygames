(yeah, yeah, if you don't drink beer, I'll buy you a smoothie or something.  Jeez, why you gotta be so hard to please?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a year ago, I read <i>Wicked</i> and also played a lot of Mario games.  This combination made me want to write a story about Mario that took the Mario characters and vague stories then turned them into something credible (I love seeing my favorite fantastical stuff made credible--although I don't like logical, explicit cosmologies) and morally problematic.  If all that sounds weird, that's why I never wrote the story.  But imagine, if you will:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Mushroom King (conspicuously absent from the games, but necessary for this) as a divine-right monarch with dominion over all the various species and cultures of the so-called Mushroom Kingdom.  The Mushroom People get the best, while the others are interfered with, ignored, and/or exploited.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Goomba as the oppressed serfs of the Mushrooms.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Koopa as a warrior culture, long subjugated by the Mushroom People.  Their cousins the Hammer Clan (Hammer Bros. in the games) as expert blacksmiths, the Boomerang Clan as nomadic herdsmen of the Koopahari desert, the Dry Bones as priestly keepers of the holy remains of the ancient beings that these various reptiles evolved from.  The Mushroom People exploit the skills of the Hammer &amp; Boomerang clan, and defile the tombs attended by the Dry Bones.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrincess Peach as a human who entered this world through some strange circumstance as a baby, raised as a Mushroom Person and adopted by the King.  They called her Peach because of the tone of her skin relative to the fungus white of the Mushroom People.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Snowies and Flurries as theocratic cultures of the frozen north, speaking a language that sounds like the movements of glaciers.  They worship the great whales, who have been hunted to near-extinction by the Mushroom people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Pidgits as Sufi-like mystics, forbidden by the Mushroom People to practice their faith.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Shys as an enterprising merchant culture and the Snifits as a technologically advanced engineering culture.  Again, these talents are exploited by the Mushroom People.<br/>\n<br/>\nBowser as the most highly-evolved of the Koopa yet, and proven through lifelong struggle to be the strongest and most ruthless.  By their customs, this entitles him to be chieftain.  His rule is hard and ruthless, because that's what the Koopa WANT.  He is, in effect, an elected official (contrast to the divine-right Mushroom King).<br/>\n<br/>\nKamek, Bowser's advisor, as the only sorcerer in the world, and a socialist with ambitions of political reform.  He is low on the evolutionary ladder, and if not for his mysterious power he would be a second-class citizen of the Koopa.  He sees in Bowser the tools for change and convinces Bowser to ally with the other oppressed cultures (who put aside their differences to unite against a common foe) and secede from the Mushroom King.  Bowser names himself King of the Koopa, and the rebellion begins.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach.  But here's why:  unaware that Peach is not a fungus, he sees her and interprets her differences as evolutionary advancements.  He sees in her the only woman in the world as evolved as he is, his only equal.  She becomes an obsession, and he kidnaps her (at great personal risk) because he intends to marry her.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter into all of this Mario, who is just a plumber from the human world that ended up here by some strange circumstance.  Taken in by the Mushroom People and fed on their power mushrooms, he grows to twice his normal height and his strength increases tenfold--making it second only to Bowser's.  Toad, the King's chancellor, sees in Mario their chance to retrieve the Princess and turn the tide of the war.  Filling Mario's head with propaganda, he convinces Mario to take on the role of champion of the Mushroom people.  Trained in the use of the deadly fire flowers and power stars, he is sent on his mission.<br/>\n<br/>\nMario, Bowser, Peach, and Kamek are the PCs.  Mario's desire is to do the right thing, his goal is to save the Princess, and his issue is power--he's just been granted a ton of it, way more than he had as a plumber, and must learn to use it with prudence.  Bowser's desire is to achieve the independence of his people, his goal is to marry the Princess, and his issue is mercy and discretion--he's a hammer and EVERYTHING looks like a nail, but as long as he remains the savage and ruthless warrior he was raised to be, there can only be more killing on both sides.  Peach's desire is also to do the right thing, her goal is to escape from Bowser, and her issue is class--seeing herself as superior to everyone else and seeing Bowser as an upstart, ungrateful vassal, her attitude throws a wrench into any chances for peace and reconciliation.  Kamek's desire is equality, his goal is to effect political change, and his issue is confrontation--because he fears direct conflict, he is attempting to manipulate a dangerous person, a person <i>who does not even share his ideals</i>, to get his goals; he is attacking a delicate problem with a volatile hammer.  Bonus points if Kamek's magic is accomplished through some sort of foreign agency (as in familiar spirit, etc.) such that even when using THAT he still is not approaching things directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's the setup.  I have no frickin' clue how it would all resolve, but I'd sure like to hear about it.  I can't do it myself because I don't have the games that I think would handle it well, and I don't have 4 other people to play it with.  And I don't think I'd be able to talk them into it if I did.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Marshall                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158173/#Comment_158173" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-23T13:28:31+00:00" title="July 23, 2008  1:28PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!<br><br>Definitely sounds like a IaWA game to me.

Although, personally, I find it coolest if Kamek's magic is the only magic in the world, but I'm a very low-magic kind of guy.

And by making it a long, obscure, exotic and dangerous ritual, it could work on a low magic setting very well. In fact, their berserker rages are caused because magic is so unreliable...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
