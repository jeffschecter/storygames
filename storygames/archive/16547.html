Instead of stories like <b>The Emperor's New Clothes</b><br/>\nWe dress up stories around a frame work of rules and sometimes it works!<br/>\nSome times it doesn't and we see through our invisible worlds into the naked truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dressing up is difficult it doesn't take long before it can feel all made up, and for someone to say so.<br/>\nCompelling stories off the cuff ? on the wing! need something to make them fly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look at D&amp;D; it fly s, but its a predictable flight path.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have your captain and passengers, why would the passengers want to fly the plane its scary right!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you begin to design a game or fictional story game which involves all.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan it be done? what prevents it, e,g, knowing the plot in advance.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379280/#Comment_379280" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T12:17:38+00:00" title="May 22, 2012 12:17PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not an authority, but I'm pretty sure this had been done, though it depends on what you mean by "story".<br><br>Many games like this feature no specific GM, with all players being equal, though some have a GM, but give the players some GM powers (constantly or occasionally).<br><br>I had an <i>amazing</i> experience with "Remember Tomorrow", by which we produced a very interesting experience of near-future, cyberpunk drama with AIs, replicants, street-gangs and government conspiracies, and it never felt in danger of exposing itself, because, I think, "Remember Tomorrow" is almost all "clothes", all the way to the center.<br><br>(Run-on sentence, for the win!)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379670/#Comment_379670" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T13:18:02+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  1:18PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2012 1:19PM by Paul88.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Lundanto, I will check out Remember Tomorrow sounds interesting "Clothes all the way" :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>I'm not an authority, but I'm pretty sure this had been done, though it depends on what you mean by "story"</b><br/>\nI think your right it has been done.
