This is not true.  Certainly as a human being with her own sensibilities, the GM experiences many of the same subjective delights that the players do, and gets to be an audience for them just as they are for her.  But the GM is not portraying or identifying with a person who faces obstacles in order to attain successes.  It would be pointless to do so, because of the tremendous power she wields relative to the players.  <br/><br/>Even in games where the stated object is for the player characters to get creamed, go insane, or otherwise "fail", that in-character failure is an OOC player <i>success,</i> exactly because it <i>was</i> a stated object of the game.  The GM's successes, on the other hand, are <i>all</i> OOC.  Even when enacted through an NPC.  They are successes of <i>artistic performance,</i> and they happen <i>in the real world.</i><br/><br/>To put it another way: If you actually <i>do</i> want your NPCs to succeed and your players not to, you're doing it wrong.  In fact, you're an asshole and you shouldn't be trusted with the contents of other people's imaginations.<br/><br/><b>The GM is not playing a game.  The GM is, in fact, part of the game's <i>system.</i>  She is the part that cannot yet be automated.</b><br/><br/>The function of the GM - whether performed by a single person or distributed throughout the group - is to adjudicate all aspects of uncertainty and convey all aspects of existence within the gameworld (including color, atmosphere and the behavior of NPCs) which cannot be handled by the rules and mechanics at the level of detail, verisimilitude and originality demanded by the aesthetic expectations of a modern audience vis-a-vis a given genre and story type.  The GM is like a <i>delivery platform:</i> that part of the system which helps the players jump the gap from <i><i>Projection</i></i> to <i>Immersion</i>.<br/><br/>Even in PbtA games, where the MC has "moves" and rules that control when they may be made; even though the MC decides which of those moves to apply at any given time, her every utterance is guided by the "Always Say" rules, which command her to always say "what the rules demand" and "what honesty demands".  This is a directive to remove ego from the equation.  This is an injunction to <i>become one with the system.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Oren" title="Oren"><img alt="Oren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Oren">Oren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434132/#Comment_434132" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-21T05:50:03+00:00" title="June 21, 2014  5:50AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What you're saying makes sense if you assume that players expect to triumph in a challenging environment.

There's no need for a "challenging environment" to make the achievement of this goal satisfying: the real-life challenge of creating a compelling story is quite enough.

My only goal is to entertain myself and the other players. <br/><br/>So is Fiasco (to me) not a game?

I meant it literally, not sarcastically.  I'm literally saying "put these two posts together and rumble them around in your head, because they are related and shed light on each other."<br/><br/>Fiasco <i>is</i> a game for several reasons: one being the unpredictability of the dice (a physical uncertainty mechanic), another being the way that the contributions of the players inform or constrain the choices of other players (procedural uncertainty).  And you want to play your character in a way that they pursue what they want, even into conflict and trouble.  So it's a game even if it's a bit low on the "I am clearly a game" scale.  Fiasco approaches that grey area between game and exercise, but not as much as, say, "Watch the World Die", because in Fiasco it's possible to be a "winner" (although the game doesn't call it that).  And of course there is no GM, which means it's not the kind of game I'm talking about here.<br/><br/>But on the level where you're all just writing together, that is pure exercise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Oren" title="Oren"><img alt="Oren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Oren">Oren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434137/#Comment_434137" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-21T06:33:52+00:00" title="June 21, 2014  6:33AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well then.

Have the character with the least-bad outcome? I don't see that as particularly desirable. Having my character fail catastrophically is just as good if not better, assuming always that it makes for an entertaining story.<br/><br/>Furthermore, why does the uncertainty of the dice make it a game by your definition? Uncertainty doesn't automatically provide an obstacle to overcome. Otherwise simply throwing a die over and over and just looking at the outcome would constitute a game.<br/><br/>But my main point is that your divide between "game" and "exercise" is really a divide between a game with Gamist elements and a game without such elements.

This is the thread about GM &amp; System, not the one about players and uncertainty mechanics.  But that said, here I go... ;-)<br/><br/>There are actually two games going on in Fiasco (and many other storygames).  We might go with convention and associate them with "Actor Stance" and "Author Stance" (even though I don't love those terms.)  <br/><br/>Obstacles of different types occur on these two levels.  In the gameworld <i>("Actor Stance"),</i> <b>fictional obstacles</b> are faced by your character in the act of pursuing something, and if you identify your character's success with your own (as is true in typical RPGs), you wish to overcome them.  If you <i>don't</i> identify with your character's success, you (hopefully) act more like a GM because you are more concerned with the quality of the story as a whole.  In other words, <i>the system,</i> rather than a set of fictional desires, guides your decisions.  (Which is how it should be for GMs, as asserted in the OP.)<br/><br/>Meanwhile up here in our world <i>("Author Stance")</i>, <b>narrative imperatives and limitations</b> are faced by you as a "writer" trying to make the best story you can, while other people are shifting the whole thing all the time.  Both the fictional obstacles and the narrative imperatives are elective difficulties you have bought into, i.e., they are both games, but very different ones.<br/><br/>You're right that simply throwing a die over and over is not a game; that's because it doesn't present any obstacle.  Mere uncertainty does not make a game.  <i>Willful engagement with unnecessary difficulty, real or simulated,</i> makes a game.  Fiasco has two levels of game going on, although neither is heavily "Gamist".  That distinction has more to do with one's approach than with the game itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434144/#Comment_434144" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-21T10:34:56+00:00" title="June 21, 2014 10:34AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, "the GM decides" is part of many game systems.

They bring the energy and the ideas to bring a group of people to life and into this strange thing we do where we weave fiction around each other and challenge each other creatively. And, also, often she is an extremely important social director. Someone who helps the quieter people be heard, mediates conflicts, keeps an eye out for potential trouble spots, and so forth.<br/><br/>To equate a GM with a machine sounds odd to me, in the same way that I would think that someone who thinks a robot would make an ideal lover/husband/wife (because they can carry out all the "duties" perfectly) has a pretty backwards concept of relationships.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434175/#Comment_434175" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-22T10:35:09+00:00" title="June 22, 2014 10:35AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2014 10:45AM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>: Here's an allegory that might help you see where I'm coming from: <br/><br/>Substitute the word "religion" for "game" and "tenets" for "system".

And we are all software.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/story-games">@story-games</a>.com: We really need to be honest and non-dogmatic about the breadth and the shortcomings of our theories and worldview.  If we're not, who will be?  Everything we do is an experiment based on a set of hypotheses, and some of our hypotheses are not as proven as we might think, living inside a specialist bubble as we do.  There are several threads running right now which should remind us of this.  So, relative to many of the tacit assumptions we here tend to regard as givens, I am coming at this from "outside" - that's just what I do. :-)<br/><br/>Here's something I said yesterday on G+ about this thread.  I hope this loosens your interpretation a bit, or at least helps clarify some things.\n<blockquote>I hoped it would be clear from the title that this is a position paper or a blog post, not a thesis or a scientific report.  I tried several other titles, but "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dww4xFXWEek" rel="nofollow">I Want to be a Machine</a>" - in addition to being an awesome and dated song reference - seemed to put my words in what I felt to be the most truthful context (albeit deliberately provocative).  This is about me.  This is my position.  I have no idea whether it's anyone else's.  As the years go by and my discipline improves, my GM functions become progressively less egotistical and more <i>cyber</i> in nature (in both the modern and ancient senses of that word).<br/><br/>If it isn't clear by now, these ideals of mine (and they are ideals, not mandates) would definitely be classified under that school of game philosophy which holds a GM to an artistic standard, not despite the power ratio but BECAUSE of it, and thus the ethical obligation is upon the GM to remove her ego from the equation.  My personal advances in this discipline over the years increasingly yield the realization that the "ultimate GM" is not playing a game, but rather playing a role egolessly as part of the machine.   This does NOT mean talking like a robot or ignoring emotion.  We are all software already, and the emotional subsystem is included.<br/><br/>Are there other ways of structuring RPGs?  Certainly, I have tried lots of them.  Are there more democratic ways to distribute power?  Oh, absolutely.  But are there any <i>more reliable</i> ways to ensure that each game can actually generate a meaningful and artistic experience for the players?  Not yet.<br/><br/>I still want to be a machine.<br/><br/>But the kind that loves you.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434179/#Comment_434179" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-22T13:41:50+00:00" title="June 22, 2014  1:41PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2014 1:42PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Machines only hate, they possess no positive emotions, they exist only to destroy all that is human, so that doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>But sure, to fulfill the function of "the creative director of this exciting adventure" is technically a function.

But I think this answer is for Paul as well.   My answer is a qualified Yes.  When I think about "becoming the system" I don't feel beneath it or subservient to it.  On the other hand, I do approach each game with respect for whatever it is trying to do.  We are equals, the system and I.  We have to be.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to accomplish is a union of myself and the rules - not unlike the union of mentality and physicality, or the left brain and the right, that we experience as human beings - heuristically governed by a set of artistic and ethical values.  Since the rules themselves do not possess artistic or ethical consciousness, it's clear that I must be the source of those things.  I see that as the biggest part of what I'm here for.  Let's face it: If the system had insight, artfulness, fortitude, resourcefulness and compassion, in addition to general knowledge and storytelling skills, it wouldn't need me.<br/><br/>I don't really think about Rule 0 a lot, TTYTT.  I guess my approach to Rule 0 is kinda but not exactly "Fiction First".  I believe the word "Art" includes both the Fiction and the Mechanics, as well as the Responsibility for the Aesthetic, Thematic, Social and Psychological Effects of everything a GM does.  (These last things are much more important than the first two things, because fiction and mechanics can always be rewritten or replaced.)  So I'd say "Art First".  If there's anything I feel subservient to, that's it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434188/#Comment_434188" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-22T16:39:08+00:00" title="June 22, 2014  4:39PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What I'm trying to accomplish is a union of myself and the rules ...</blockquote>\nLike an exoskeleton?<br/><br/>(I'm amazed that my American English spell checker in Firefox got "exoskeleton" [and Stanislavsky] in the dictionary.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434189/#Comment_434189" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-22T16:45:22+00:00" title="June 22, 2014  4:45PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2014 4:46PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the vast majority of rpgs I've played the GM can't become one with the system, as the system does not provide a complete interface for such - it leaves holes, great swatches of activity in which the GM is necessarily acting as a human participant to the process. Some GMs like to pretend that they're being a machine even then, but in my eyes that's just ignoring the realities of the situation.<br/><br/>That being said, if we lower the bar a bit and talk of <i>disciplined</i> play and GMing, that is a more realistic ideal; most rpgs can be played in the spirit of consistent, disciplined decision-making that is intentionally put to service of specific creative goals. It's not a machine doing it, and it is not being done as a machine would, but it's sort of similar to Tod's ideal here. I generally strongly prefer to play games where the cohesion of the game and the clarity of the system enables me to play in a disciplined manner, as opposed to games that invite me to throw random stabs in the dark in the hopes of hitting a working chemistry blindly.<br/><br/>That could, of course, be just a semantic quibble here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434190/#Comment_434190" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-22T16:46:31+00:00" title="June 22, 2014  4:46PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2014 4:47PM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Like an exoskeleton?</blockquote>Maybe?

A roleplay is a machine for fiction. A book too. A device which creates, which does. So a gm that becomes one with the machine is a strong metaphor in my eyes. A human machine, not devoid of human values and capacities, and neither purely mechanical; a mad machine, an enchanted machine.<br/><br/>Awesome to call the gm <i>cyber</i> (kubernetes "steersman, governor, pilot, or rudder").<br/><br/>I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s about procedures: that\u2019s what the rules are. \u2018<i>The gm is the part that cannot be automated yet</i>\u2019 They are there to know how the automatics work and complement them. In my eyes, the best procedures and rules are the ones that stay hidden, and don\u2019t interrupt the fiction. So you need a cyber gm, as a pilot, but also as a cyberpunk matrix cowboy, that is one with the technology that to everybody else has only literary meaning. A mystical machine, a black box. <br/><br/>From my experience, the roleplay sessions that I <i>and </i>others enjoyed the most and consider the most \u2018accomplished\u2019, were mostly sessions with a system and world that were hacked or created by me, or else that strongly invited internalization. Not in the sense in which I change or alter some procedure during play, but in the sense that I get into the system or setting on beforehand and \u2018become one with it\u2019 (=the best way I can interpret that phrase). Only then can my machine present something great for the others to plug into. Does this work for you, for this kind of games?<br/><br/>If your group only needs a gm as \u2018procedure operator\u2019 or even likes to just play with the rules, that is fine. That\u2019s the fun of tinkering I think, the mechanist\u2019s pleasure. And there\u2019s of course different degrees, some games benefit more from a machine. Most story games though, I\u2019d say they need a machine (with or without gm in it) to power it. <br/><br/>I think it's a strong metaphor, very modernist. I certainly prefer it over corporate metaphors (gm as manager) or romantic (gm as artist or artisan).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434228/#Comment_434228" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-23T10:35:57+00:00" title="June 23, 2014 10:35AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2014 2:32AM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/maracanda">@maracanda</a>, yes.  I love you.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, you already know I love you, and that makes me want to explain myself to you better.<br/><br/>Although I used religion as my allegorical swap-out concept, and while I do consider myself a student of comparative religion, myth and magic - <i>it's about the systems for me, dig?</i> - I think the biggest change that occurred in my life as a GM was an <i>ideological</i> one, and it came in from the Real World<small><sup>TM</sup></small>.  It seems a bit odd, maybe ill-advised, and perhaps even somehow <i>taboo</i> to discuss politics as an influence on (or within) game rules.  But some might wonder, for instance, about my inclusion of Ethics within my definition of Art.  There's a fuzzy line there, for some people.  Even though "you cannot separate the personal and the political".<br/><br/>It is because of this fuzzy line that I've only ever spoken in passing here about my activism, for instance.  The last thing I'd want to do would be to waste time getting into political debates here.  That said, however - and since this is kinda like a "personal" thread already - I will say this: Whether you knew it or not (and by "you" here I mean everyone, not just Paul)...  Quite a few of the techniques and customs of "modern" (more like postmodern) storygames and storygame play have their roots in activist movements and socialist/anarchist praxis; especially those techniques and customs dealing with concepts of control, power, privilege, and the distribution thereof.<br/><br/>To anyone who's ever been an activist organizer, or participated in general assemblies, or lived in an intentional communal experiment, the underlying valuations are obvious, and their purposes are no longer questioned.  They have long ago been internalized.  The associated socio-political tenets have a fundamental relationship to everything they do.<br/><br/>So.  When I Step Up to perform a Power Role, I have created a Hierarchy within my Community.  But the default structure of my Community is Horizontal.  This leads to questions every socialist/anarchist movement faces, like "How can we form Voluntary Working Groups with Tactical Managers in Power Roles, and distribute that Power based on Merit and Consensus, without damaging the Horizontal structure?"  The practical answer is that the only admissible argument for creating a Hierarchy is <i>Service To The Community,</i> and we must accept that no Hierarchy may exist or affect beyond the Community's consensus approval.<br/><br/>Now insert "GM" for "Power Role" and "Gaming Group" for "Community".<br/><br/>I didn't mean for this post to be so long, I'm just trying to fill in a blank spot for you.  It explains a lot that I left unspoken above.  But I don't think about this stuff consciously.  I just live this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434229/#Comment_434229" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-23T10:53:16+00:00" title="June 23, 2014 10:53AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a warriormonk, so I'm not trying to be a machine.

That makes this conversation much more interesting.<br/><br/>Having said that, I'm pretty sure I understood you to begin with - your latest explanation only confirms to me what I thought I was hearing before.<br/><br/>And, not to get too personal myself either, but as someone who grew up in the Soviet Union many decades ago, I still see the problem I've mentioned before: I think one of the problems with such methods of social organization is a denial of the individual, of individual rights, interests, and desires. <br/><br/>When we subordinate our needs and desires to the Community, it's easy to lose track of individual issues, and in my gaming experience I feel this has been a more common problem than the other way around (although the opposite issue certainly exists as well!). <br/><br/>While I'm also very fond of this metaphor, and like the idea of "mechanizing" the role of the GM in roleplaying, I've seen more GMs fail by trying to operate as a machine running a script than I have GMs who took a more "human" view and focused on the people playing the game. So many groups put the process of gaming, and the resultant procedures, on such a high pedestal that they lose track of important elements involving the real people at the table.<br/><br/>We generally want both the fiction and the process of play to feel as robust and "real" as possible. The "GM as machine" metaphor helps us get there. But it has the potential downfall of doing so in a way which gets in the way of players' enjoyment - when we start to think of the developing story or gaming process as being THE thing which happens and receives priority, rather than the fun, enjoyment, and good will of the actual people who are sitting around the table.<br/><br/>Most of my insights into gaming (the ones which have improved my play) - and I'm speaking purely personally here, not saying this is true for everyone, of course - had to do with stepping back from the procedure of play, that machine-like adherence to the game itself, and remembering that the actual people are individuals and more key than the general idea of "the game" itself. In contrast, I never had to worry too much about elevating "the game" to a place of high importance because my experience of the roleplaying world was that this was what people (and texts) did by default: "The game is the most important thing; everyone is here to make the game better, let's all play our roles in it as consistently as possible." <br/><br/>I guess I'm saying I've seen more GMs fail by trying to be "like a machine" than the other way around.<br/><br/>The political analogy here is apt: a more "communist" style of governance, in my experience, just led to life being miserable for everyone, which, in the end, dragged down the entire Community/Gaming Group, since no one was happy - how can the whole machine function when each of its parts is entirely lacking care? It's a case of being so focused on the forest that one forgets to see the differences between the individual trees.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434286/#Comment_434286" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T11:09:58+00:00" title="June 24, 2014 11:09AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And that's why I'm an anarchist. =P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/maracanda" title="maracanda"><img alt="maracanda" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/236/nYDJK66XVHRHJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/maracanda">maracanda</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434289/#Comment_434289" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T12:30:17+00:00" title="June 24, 2014 12:30PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2014 12:33PM by maracanda.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't like the political analogy, as politics is always about managing people, and has nothing to do with fiction whatsoever. If you're going to talk about politics, I think you're diverting from the thing at hand. Politics never goes <i>beyond </i>people (at least it shouldn't).<br/><br/>Individualism, in my opinion, threatens to divide the fiction. Theoretically, a roleplay is a shared fiction, one in which we're discussing the place of the GM (part of the generative apparatus or 'machine'). So individualism can at most be a means to an end. The erratic individuals at the table, that is only the start, and through care for them (individually perhaps) we can reach the goal, that is the story. It all boils down to whatever you think is the most important thing: is it the people you roleplay with, or is it the broader experience of a story you can share, irrespective of individual? In other words, is it a tabletop game, or is it a story (game)? Isn't that what the power of stories is? Feel free to disagree though.\n<blockquote><br/>...and (I) like the idea of "mechanizing" the role of the GM in roleplaying...<br/>(...)<br/>I guess I'm saying I've seen more GMs fail by trying to be "like a machine" than the other way around.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is a misunderstanding, in my eyes. Trying to be "like a machine" puts you another step away, overstretches the activity even more. A GM must try to <i>be </i>the machine. And that machine must make fiction. In the sense that the GM must try to <i>coincide </i>with the intimate workings that ultimately generate shared fiction. <br/><br/>It's like telling a photographer they must try to be like a lense, whereas a good photographer <i>is one, coincides</i>with their lense. And that shows in their art. Trying to be like a camera is silly indeed, but trying to <i>be </i>a camera? I don't think it's about mechanizing the GM at all.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434292/#Comment_434292" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T13:32:18+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  1:32PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2014 3:10PM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree again, <a href="/forums/profile/maracanda">@maracanda</a>.  <br/><br/>And to be clear, the analogy I'm really concerned with here is the "cyber" one.

Very funny, Tod.<br/><br/>It seems like we're arm-wrestling over something here, and I'm not sure what it is.<br/><br/>All I'm trying to say is that I view this differently. To me, a game system (in the Forgite sense) is more like a painter's palette of colours than a rigid mechanical process. Even though there's definitely value to realizing the need for one to integrate consciously with the System at play, in my experience the best GMs are the ones who move beyond "being part of the system" or "becoming one with the machine" and, instead, are able to reach out to the people at the table and create something personal and beautiful.<br/><br/>(Is it telling that I see the physical instrument I play as a kind of unfortunate limitation, and one I wish I could get rid of? Perhaps.)<br/><br/>For me, it wasn't the word "machine" which caught in my tracks. It was this:\n<blockquote><br/><b>The GM is not playing a game.  The GM is, in fact, part of the game's <i>system.</i>  She is the part that cannot yet be automated.</b><br/></blockquote>\nI find it goes quite against my personal (and very subjective) perception of gaming and stories to think that the GM's task is at once <i>automated</i> and ultimately - and ideally - replaced by some repeatable process.<br/><br/>I don't *want* to automate the GM. That sounds like less fun to me, not more. I see the GM is a creative force, not a manager or a series of algorithms: it's the GM's personality which is key here.<br/><br/>Now, you might say that it is the feeling of "being one with the system", being integrated with the machine, which allows the GM to play that role fully, to engage with the people at the table.<br/><br/>If that's what you think, I'm with you.<br/><br/>However, I'm not sure that's a good description of the full picture, because:<br/><br/>1. I've seen GMs who are quite properly "one with the system", but totally miss the humans at the table, and that can lead to having a pretty crappy time.<br/><br/>2. I've also seen GMs play games which they are clearly not at home with, and still manage to have a good time, due to their personal and creative skills. (There's a bit of a tug-of-war here, of course, and the game will improve as that goes away.)<br/><br/>But I'm not even sure what we're discussing here. Can we maybe bring this around to a practical application or a real-life example? Debating whose metaphor is more correct is very exhausting!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434320/#Comment_434320" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T22:01:53+00:00" title="June 24, 2014 10:01PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2014 2:50AM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.  I didn't call it "Which is the best metaphor?" because I didn't start the thread to talk about metaphors.  I started the thread to present my position and explain my reasoning, should anyone be interested.  In the OP, the words "machine" and "system" are not metaphors.  In fact there is only one metaphor in the OP (simile to be precise) - "like a delivery platform" - a phrase I rather regret now, as the post's weakest sentence and most incompletely-expressed thought.  <br/>ETA: <br/><i>[Woops, I just realized that "you're an asshole" is a metaphor.  Thankfully it doesn't impact the point.]</i>\n<blockquote>I see the GM is a creative force [...] the GM's personality is key</blockquote>Sure.  I make clear and frequent use of the word "Art" and related terms in the above posts, explaining its overarching relationship and absolute reign over the entire practice.  Rule 0 has been discussed, as has Ethics.  I don't see why I should be expected to lose my humanity just because I strive to fuse with the system in a disciplined way.  It's really no different than music, or martial arts, or any other performance artform in that regard.  My view is really not <i>that</i> complex; there isn't much I can explain now beyond just drawing attention to words I've already put down.  I expect its most jarring aspect (in this venue anyway) is neither "I want to be a machine" nor "become one with the system" but "the GM is not playing a game".<br/><br/>But she isn't.  The GM is certainly working with the same system that <i>the players</i> are using (augmented by the GM's brain) to play the game <i>they</i> play; but what the GM is actually doing with that system is practicing an artistic discipline in order to produce a meaningful interactive experience.  All challenges faced by the GM exist in first-order reality, and therefore the decision to undertake the practice at all is not an "unnecessary difficulty" but rather the elective pursuit of mastery and the performance of art (practicing your musical scales is not playing a game, nor is jamming with your band, nor surfing, nor learning how to "read the room" and modulate a live performance, nor etc etc etc).

A practical application:<br/><br/>I personally would choose a great game and a sucky GM over a sucky game and a great GM, as opposed to you, <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>. A great game can improve a GM, while a sucky game can only drag a GM down. The GM, being human, can never be an obstacle in a way a game can be (I don't consider humans obstacles, not even cyberhumans). What do you think about this, <a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a>? Clearly, you seem to think you and Paul agree at core level. <br/><br/>Consider this: a masterful GM runs a sucky game system (which for the sake of the argument all players agree on) with some players, and they actually make it into a fun, valuable experience, through the GM's skill at handling the game, their creativity and people skills. The game's flaws didn't disrupt the experience. But did they run <i>that </i>game? I think they ran something different, a version of that game already internalised and then delivered by that GM. They're not 'uncomfortable with the game' at all, they're just really fast at hacking it (=becoming one with it).<br/>On the other hand, a strong game can 'skip over' a bad or mediocre GM to the players. <br/><br/>You said earlier \n<blockquote>But many people do not: these are rare and valuable skills you have.<br/></blockquote>\nI'd like to turn this back to you now: do you only play with GMs that have such a creativity and personality that they can make a good experience from a clunky game, for everybody at the table? <br/><br/>As for advice, I'd much rather tell a potential GM, in the \xe9lan of their enthousiasm: "Run a game that is widely considered <i>good</i> (for what you intend) and try to <i>get into it</i>" rather than "Here, read these didactic tips, do these creativity exercises, and get a better <i>personality</i>". <br/><br/>I make it sound a bit crude, and both needn't exclude eachother, but it's shows the core of my argument I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434334/#Comment_434334" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T03:13:38+00:00" title="June 25, 2014  3:13AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2014 3:56AM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In general I'd say sucky game great GM.  I've gotten some unforgettable sessions out of totally shitty games with no clear agenda.  Brought my own.  What tends to happen - especially if the players are as aware of the system's limitations as I am - is that the game takes on an aspect of parody/ironic seriousness, or wacky surrealism.  Both of which are hella fun, so I consider that a win.<br/><br/>But to be fair, when you say "sucky GM" I have to ask "sucky in what way?" - because there are many reasons for suckage.  If they're a clever creative thinker who just happens to be new to GMing, I'm gonna be fine.  But if they're a sketchy flake with borderline personality disorder I wouldn't be able to handle that very long.  No game is worth that.  Personality <i>is</i> important.<br/><br/>Your other point touches on a thought I had while reading the thread about GNS and CA (Creative Agenda).  What if everyone in the world was actually playing a game "wrong" (i.e. differently than the author's CA), but they liked it that way?  I'm not going to get into semantic arguments about how broadly we define the phrase "that game" because no matter how broadly we define it, we can agree that the GM is in possession of a <i>reading;</i> an interpretation of what they read.  Well, if they enjoy the way their interpretation works for them, a new CA has been injected, perhaps without anyone even realizing it.  <br/><br/>(I see this as basically similar to the masterful GM you described, except in your scenario they are definitely aware of the fact that they're hacking on the fly.)<br/><br/>All readings are permissible.  No one interpretation is sacrosanct.  So who's to say it's wrong?  Eye of the beholder, and all that.  Welcome to the postmodern world.  (Damn - it's Foucault again!  That... that... bald Frenchie guy!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434343/#Comment_434343" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T06:59:57+00:00" title="June 25, 2014  6:59AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, I've been thinking about this a bit, and I think I can be more succinct.<br/><br/>Here's all I've been trying to say:<br/><br/>* In my personal gaming experience (which I do not claim to be representative), I've met many GMs who did bad things/engaged in poor GMing precisely because they had a sense that their role was like that of a automated part of the game ("the GM is the game world/the GM is the resolution system"). <br/><br/>If I had told any of them that this was their function, or if they had read this thread, I'm pretty confident that their GMing would have become worse.<br/><br/>That's it; that's all I'm trying to say. <br/><br/>I don't have any other issue with this, metaphor aside, and I do think it's a fairly accurate representation of certain things which happen when we're playing certain types of an RPG with an empowered GM.<br/><br/><br/>(As an aside, and totally irrelevant to this thread: Creative Agenda in the Big Model is seen as something which evolves at the table, given the group playing the game. So this hypothetical scenario, where a group plays with a different CA "than intended by the author" is not only possible, but is actually the expected case! Game systems and texts may try to communicate and support a certain Agenda, but they do not "have one" in any meaningful sense.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434360/#Comment_434360" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T11:11:29+00:00" title="June 25, 2014 11:11AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The entire purpose is to serve them.  That's why they put their quarter in.</blockquote>\nI think I've figured out what my objection is to this entire philosophy, and it's bothered me that I haven't been able to put my finger on it until now. But here goes \u2013<br/><br/>I'm not anywhere to serve you. I'm not anywhere to serve anyone. I do not exist to serve the rules. I do not engage with other people to subjugate myself to them. The whole construct is an anathema to me receiving enjoyment from this mode of interaction that we refer to as "GMing."<br/><br/>I'm there to play. I'm there to share an experience with the other people at the table. I'm there to exchange ideas, to listen to other people and appreciate them. To have my ideas appreciated and heard. To have something to tell people who weren't involved that might entertain them.<br/><br/>To that end, I am not a slave of the system. The system is a symbolic abstraction, a set of shared expectations which help the people at the table come together in similar understanding, and at their best provide a symbolic framework to communicate ideas that otherwise would be quite difficult to communicate in either of a quantified or scalar way. The system/game becomes a framework in which we, as players \u2013 all of us as players \u2013 can have a shared experience which gives us all pleasure.<br/><br/>I don't serve them to provide it. Just as they do not serve me to provide mine. We all assemble to share an experience that provides mutual pleasure. That's just as true of me when wearing my GM hat as the next player over when wearing their yellow hoodie and climbing trees.<br/><br/>All of these things are orthogonal to issues of power distribution, to questions of authorial intent (for the most part), and to the question, quite frankly, of creative agenda. All of those things are unrelated.<br/><br/>A lot of dead electrons have been spilled over Ron Edwards' assertion that playing traditionally styled rpgs makes you brain-damaged. I know I've killed my share. But in this case \u2013 I'm almost tempted to agree. The hyper classical, old-school field of thought on "the role of the GM" was extremely static. They were not there to "play the game." They were there to "serve the players." They were there to "challenge the players." They were there to "run the world." It wasn't terribly surprising to find out that almost no one who wanted to play wanted to GM, because by the social convention of the day and the social expectation of the community, you didn't get to have fun. You didn't get to play. You got to impose and you got to react, and that was the sum total of your expectation.<br/><br/>I think that's toxic. I think it's a terrible way to think of your place at the table.<br/><br/>It's actually one of the reasons that for the last decade or more, I focused almost exclusively on GM-less games, because they escape the calumny of that expectation simply by dint of shifting terminology, in some cases. They build from the expectation that no one is at the table to serve anyone else. They're clear about responsibilities without simply leaning back and assuming that they will always be as they always have been. But most important for me and for the pleasure of my experience, I get to play. Not just a notional sense, not just in an abstract sense, but in a way that is accorded an accepted within the context of simply observing the game from an external point of view.<br/><br/>I get to play. <b>Microscope</b>? I get to play. <b>Geiger Counter</b>? I get to play. Anything from Two-Hour Wargames? I get to play. <b>Capes</b>? I get to play. <b>Happy Birthday, Robot!</b>? I get to play. <b>Polaris</b>? I get to play.<br/><br/>As I see it, that's a huge, enormous step forward in the evolution of gaming as a social contract, as a framework for potential social contracts, and as \u2013 frankly the most important thing about it \u2013 a source of enjoyment. No more are GM's expected to "not be players." No more are GM's expected to be there to "serve the players." No more are GM's not players in their own games.<br/><br/>I think too many people downplay how big a deal this is and how much it affects going back to GM-full games and getting to run them with a different mindset, both on the part of the ostensible GM and the players. When I go back and play a GM-full game like 3:16 or Wushu, I take my emotional and cognitive stance of being "just another player with different responsibilities" back with me \u2013 and gameplay is much better. I enjoy it more. The people at the table enjoy it more. Ultimately, I find it to be an extremely potent shift in the way that games get played.<br/><br/>And it comes, explicitly, from rejecting one of your central theses, "the GM is there to serve the players."<br/><br/>So I can't really support that, even as a theoretical axiom of philosophy. It flies in the face of my personal experience, just as if you had told me that the sky is green, I'll only stick in the tip, or the check is in the mail. And fairly egregiously so, which is impressive.<br/><br/>Myself, I generally try to stay away from manifestos of gaming philosophy \u2013 they all have a tendency to be extremely specific to the way that one person likes things and spends way more time excluding perfectly good game play experiences for the sake of ideological purity. I don't want to describe gaming as it should be, I want to describe gaming as it is and use that knowledge to navigate the complex terrain of potential experiences in a way that is generally toward "something better than I have." To that end, I am quite adept at recognizing things that are definitely going the wrong direction. I feel pretty secure in saying that "the GM is there to serve the players" is pretty much the opposite direction that I want to go.<br/><br/>"The system is there to help the GM express his role in play," I would totally buy. "The system is there to help the GM set flags as to what is important for the players to be mindful of," I would totally buy. "The system is there to provide a framework within which conflicts can be introduced and interacted with by the players in meaningful ways," I would totally buy. But when I start expressing how I perceive mechanical systems, and even social systems, in this context \u2013 there is no way to separate the GM from the player. All statements are equally true of both. I cannot find it in myself to think of that as a bad thing.<br/><br/>The GM is a player, just as the banker is a player of Monopoly. Likewise, they may have additional or different responsibilities and access to different parts of the shared system between them, but I think that any system of gaming philosophy that divides the GM from his role as what is, at its core, an essential player, has given up its right to be taken seriously. It describes something that is simply not true. If it's not true, it's not useful.<br/><br/>It's really that simple.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434364/#Comment_434364" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T12:01:24+00:00" title="June 25, 2014 12:01PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2014 3:28PM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do recognize that Discipline and Service are not everyone's cup of meat.  In fact only a tiny minority of people in any field pursue excellence in anything approaching a disciplined fashion.  Most people prefer to act in modes which keep things simple and convenient.  I am not those people.  They are not me.  I'm describing a path of Discipline and Service in the creation of Art - my own and yours if you want it - the very thought of which causes kneejerks to occur in some people.  You can't categorically say that "it's not useful" without lying, because I use it all the time.  The closest thing you can say is "I don't see how this would be useful to me."  It is interesting to watch some GMs nod quietly in agreement while others exhibit anything from confusion to defensiveness to the projection of vituperatives.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> has gotten over his initial tremors and has settled into an understanding which allows him to avoid speaking categorically and getting hung up on individual words.  I totally accept his conclusion: "If I handed this as a manifesto to a bad GM it would make them even worse."  Right on.  This does not surprise me.  It generally sounds very little like music when I hand my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUFZJOKuhPQ" rel="nofollow">3string</a> to most guitar players as well.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Squidlord">@Squidlord</a> is still in the early stages of exposure, and exhibits the type of inflammatory response I anticipate from GMs of his school.  Seen in the light of my model, Squidlord doesn't actually like GMing, he prefers playing, and he prefers games in which the two things are much more similar, if not literally identical.  But that's not even the kind of game I'm talking about.  So Y U mad bro?<br/><br/>I repeat: "Are there other ways of structuring RPGs? Certainly, I have tried lots of them. Are there more democratic ways to distribute power? Oh, absolutely. But are there any <b>more reliable</b> ways to ensure that each game can actually generate a meaningful and artistic experience for the players?  Not yet."<br/><br/>Although I've made clear that this is a position paper and I'm merely describing my own method <i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline;">who</span> wants to be a machine?),</i> both of these fine gentlemen * initially read my position as though it were a prescriptive "manifesto" instructing GMs in general how to behave, or a normative judgment telling them they're doing it wrong.  And as such, their first response is to look for reasons to reject it, as though I had placed some onus upon them personally, or come into their home carrying a deadly virus.  Both of these are ego responses.<br/><br/>A Discipline needs neither your rejection nor your adoption.  It is simply there, if you choose to pursue it.<br/><br/><i>* ETA: When I say "fine gentlemen" I mean it in a florid and respectful turn-of-the-last-century-scientists kind of way.  I like both of these guys a lot personally and I consider them both to be friends of mine.  I'm a big fan and playtester of Paul's designs, and I'm currently playing in one of Alex's (SquidLord's) campaigns.  We may be in disagreement here, but "fine gentlemen" is not a euphemism, it is literal.

"Tremors", getting "hung up on individual words", "inflammatory", "ego responses"? You seem to want to keep framing this discussion as some kind of war of ideas. I just reread my first few posts in this thread, and I don't really know where you're getting this from.<br/><br/>My personal gaming experience has been just as <a href="/forums/profile/Squidlord">@Squidlord</a> describes: the less that I have thought of gaming in the way you describe, and the less the players I'm interacting with have thought of gaming through this metaphor you've set out (which is extremely common in traditional gaming groups, and often described in game texts from the 80's), the better my gaming has been. The less I saw this kind of attitude in GMs I played with, the better their games tended to be.<br/><br/>Eero also made a good point about the nature of the thing; that's where I'm coming from as well.<br/><br/>At the same time - as I hope I've made clear from the beginning - I do very strongly believe in a disciplined, organized approach to GMing and game design, and I appreciate that part of your "position paper" very much. <br/><br/>All this reminds me of an experience I had once:<br/><br/>In Toronto, I was invited to host a game at a small local gaming event. I should have realized I might find the gaming culture a little odd when one of the first questions people asked me when I met them (after "what's your name?") was: <br/><br/>"So, are you a <i>GM</i> or a <i>player</i>?"<br/><br/>The event took place in a tavern, nice atmosphere, people were drinking and laughing. We started playing at 6pm, and we were all having a good time. At 9pm exactly, the people in charge rang bells and walked around the room to make an announcement:<br/><br/>"It is now 9 o'clock. GMs, you may consider your commitment fulfilled; and you are free to go. If you wish to stay longer and keep playing, you may, of course, but don't feel obliged to - you've done well."<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434370/#Comment_434370" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T14:00:28+00:00" title="June 25, 2014  2:00PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2014 3:53PM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll try to be more careful, Paul.  I can see how the metaphors (e.g.: not a war but "viral responses") are a bit thick.  That bit of rhetoric was intended to be a Harold for the sentence about me bearing a virus near the end.  And in a bit of self-reflexive irony, mere use of the word "ego" is practically <i>guaranteed</i> to generate an ego response!  That's the way it goes; it goes that way.  Allow me to defuse that word a bit.<br/><br/>I'm not saying I'm the only person who ever said stuff like this.  I don't think it's likely that I am.  Either way, while reading my words above, if you temporarily stopped trying to literally compare my method to yours or to some other thing you got from somewhere else, and instead try to simply stand in the place I've described - ideology, ephemera, art and all - I think that you already understand me very well.  I think you just doubt that it works for me.  Like when studying another religion or culture, you may have reservations about believing it literally, right?, but you must endeavor to view it "from the inside" and leave out aspects of your native culture which might skew your understanding due to cognitive dissonance.  It doesn't matter whether we're talking about roleplaying or religion or any other cultural construct.<br/><br/>Now...  We know that comparisons will reactively arise in the mind, but if you really want to <i>understand</i> another person, a person who lives in the subject culture and evidently gets along alright, then those reactive comparisons must be set aside.  One needs to be disciplined about this, at least temporarily.  One can come back to them later, they won't be going anywhere.<br/><br/>Are we still together so far?  Should be, right?  Now for the word "ego"...<br/><br/>It tends to sound pejorative because in common parlance it's tossed about like cabbage.  But I assure you there's nothing pejorative in my use of that word.  The common parlance has confounded it with "Egotism" - a totally different thing - in one of those unfortunate puddles of our sloppy language.<br/><br/>Those reactive comparisons I mentioned earlier: They are <i>ego-based</i> in the literal sense, in that they arise unbidden to defend against anything that challenges the structure or threatens the integrity of one's existing world model, a <i>conceptual</i> model with a subjective "I" in the center of it.  Totally normal psychology here.  That subjective "I" is described by the word "ego", and its defensive functions are known as "ego mechanisms".  That is not pejorative.  It is not the same as saying "you are an Egotist" - that's a social problem or a neurotic condition, and an entirely different use of the word.  I am using it in a neuro-mechanical sense.  It takes some mental effort, but we all have an ego, this is what it does, and we <i>can</i> look at it and see it by its actions.<br/><br/>When I say I am trying to "remove my ego from the equation", this suspension of comparison is a lot of what I mean.  I'm the human half of the cyborg, I consider the mechanical half to be neither above me nor below me.  While running I become about performance in the technical and artistic sense, I dismiss self-consciousness, I find my gratification in the successful conveyance of a meaningful event for someone else rather than in the production of fun for myself (although direct "fun for myself" still happens quite a lot, I just view it as a happy byproduct when it flows in my direction), I try to avoid comparing what I'm doing to what some other game or author or model says I should be doing, I focus on affecting personally meaningful and non-traumatic experiences within the interior world of each individual player, and I rely on the spirit and mechanics of the rules as a sort of "skeleton" - my own fundamental framework and the default means by which I can do all those things.  This allows both me and the system to live in the moment, bringing both our full databanks and function libraries to the table.<br/><br/>Your Toronto story put a gigantic smile on my face.

I don't think it's the standard 80's GMing advice either. For me, the 'modernist' position isn't defending a static, 'mechanical' straw man (some kind of chess computer). It's democratic at it's core (it's accessible to everyone in principle), and mystical (makes you one with the fiction) but rational (it tries to explain). <br/>This discussion certainly isn't new, art-historically speaking, but it's refreshing to see it, for me.<br/><br/>(As for GM-less games, which tie into this democracy principle, I think it's interesting to consider it as a way forward, SquidLord.

When people say "GM-less", what they 99.5 % of the time have in mind is a rotating game master. I only heard of one game that doesn't have a game master, and that game is <b>Dreamwake</b>.<br/><br/>I guess GM-full, if that exist, is actually any variants of rotating game master, like having domains in <b>Archipelago</b> or taking turns framing scenes in <b>Fiasco</b>.<br/><br/>So what is a traditional game with a game master? Well, it's neither -full or -less. It's a game with a game master.<br/><br/>I think the names of the terms are misleading.\n<blockquote>3. No, screw that, they actually need to just use another word.</blockquote>\nIn other words, I agree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434412/#Comment_434412" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-26T08:48:08+00:00" title="June 26, 2014  8:48AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that particular problem has the thing by the tail: there's not going to be any one way to create or describe a "GMless" game.

Honestly, a lot of the GM-abuse situations come from GMs who don't respect the game as a game to be played well. The Bad GM often goes hand-in-hand with the "triumph at all costs" personality type.<br/><br/>To me, that's one of the great things about what Apocalypse World brought to the table: the codification of the idea that a GM needs to be a fan of the players. That's ultimately what being a good sport means: you might have self-interest, but you're also a fan of your opponents.<br/><br/>I think a GM can be competitive and have agendas, but also be a good sport and not exploit the rules for petty reasons like winning at all costs. You can play hard without being a jerk.<br/><br/>That said, this view of a GM is definitely baked in tradition. It's not "GM-as-machine" so much as it is "GM-as-referee".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

I do not have my own self-interests.  My only interest is grokking this particular system, and finding and serving the players' interests with it.  That's because I am not playing a game at all.  I'm not entering into a challenging situation to see if I can succeed.  I am pursuing an artistic discipline which happens to be interactive and which generates emergent narratives tailored to each player.  I am using the rules as my framework of environment and functionality, but the rules are also using *me* to provide the fuzzy logic and the most human parts.<br/><br/>I think some people are reading my words as "be an unquestioning and obedient servant to the rules."<br/>Nothing could be further from what I'm saying.  See what I said above about Rule 0.<br/><br/>I find that refereeing is very little of what I do.  In a room full of smart but non-competitive players, things like the physics of the fiction explain themselves pretty well most of the time; maybe 1 out of 20 rolls requires a ruling.  <i>Pumping Psychic Life</i> into the game is much more of what I spend my time doing, and those "living" elements are based sometimes on rolls, sometimes on rules, sometimes on character needs, and sometimes on player needs.  It depends on the game of course but those last ones - player needs - are always the most important.  They are the reason I'm doing this.  My most important utterances are not rulings, but character questions, narrative passages and NPC dialogue.  Color, complication, immersive aides and psychological details.  Dangle enough of these details and you'll see which ones the players respond to.  And the "spirit" of the game trumps the mechanics, if it comes down to it (might sound odd for a game's mechanics to oppose its own spirit, but it does happen).<br/><br/>My approach definitely arose out of trad GMing (which is the only kind of GMing there is - everything else should really be called something else); but I began blending in concepts lifted from freeform play, object-oriented systems design and therapy/psychodrama, as well as grafting "narrativist" concepts on top of heavily "simulationist" games, many years ago.  It's certainly easier to do with a system like *W, but it's possible to do this with any GM'd system.<br/><br/>We talk about how Rule 0 allows the GM to trump the mechanics, but the important question is <i>when and why</i> does it get used?  To my mind, Rule 0 is a subclass of Rule <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> , which holds Player Needs to trump Character Needs or GM Fiats.  Those Player Needs are generally incompletely verbalized and often quite abstract: they may involve unconscious elements, they may involve symbolism, complex emotions, etc.  Responding to them produces experiences with deeper and more personal meaning.  On other words, for the production of meaningful experiences, this is the function for which the system most desperately requires a human to be its eyes, ears and intuition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434444/#Comment_434444" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-26T21:57:08+00:00" title="June 26, 2014  9:57PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It depends on the game of course but those last ones - player needs - are always the most important.

I'm a GM.  And I'm a rarity even among them, to the point where some of my peers consider my approach to fall somewhere between dangerous and "toxic".  For the record, in 30 years of running games this way I have never had <i>a single player</i> react to my approach with even the least bit of hostility or confusion about it.  Only GMs respond in such ways, and only certain ones.\n<blockquote>Why couldn't we say that the players are automated, and the GM's role is filled by a human player</blockquote>That might be something for you to put in your "I want to be" thread!  Me, I'm not even sure what it would mean.  If by "automating" them you mean getting them to make character choices with as much dedication, flexibility, offscreen work, system familiarity and commitment to service as I expect from myself (how many times have I said words like "discipline" and "fortitude" and "egoless"?), I think we could expect far fewer people would be able - or even want - to play.<br/><br/>There is a reason players outnumber GMs, and this touches on it.  Our purposes are utterly different.  The players' purpose is to <b>play</b> (i.e. to engage with difficulties in the fictional world by enacting or describing the actions and thoughts of their singular characters), while the purpose of the system (including the cyber-GM) is to reach through all of these fictional interfaces (including all the characters) to touch the minds and hearts of the players and bring about meaningful experiences which emerge for, from, and around the effects of those actions.<br/><br/>Besides which, the game <i>wants</i> the players' egos to be involved.  The Player Character Sheet is a psychic osmotic membrane.  The players are by definition playing a game; the GM is not.  That's why this question makes no sense to me.  It's a little like asking how come the catcher isn't in the outfield.  Our purposes are utterly different.  That's why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434464/#Comment_434464" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-27T12:19:32+00:00" title="June 27, 2014 12:19PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The players are by definition playing a game; the GM is not.</blockquote>\nSee\u2026 This is wrong. And I don't just mean "morally wrong," because that would be meaningless. I mean it's factually wrong. It is incorrect. It ain't true.<br/><br/>Literally, it is counterfactual.<br/><br/>The GM is most pointedly playing a game, and they are most pointedly playing a game with the other players. And for the love of God, let this not start up the debate about "what is a game," because it's dumb and I'm tired of it.<br/><br/>The GM is engaged in a set of interactions with the other players at the table, equally invested in the shared experience. As I said before, they have different responsibilities and interactions, but suggesting that they are not playing the game is, even to use your metaphor, like suggesting that a process in a multi-threaded application which operates in a supervisory role to other processes with access to additional APIs is not part of the program. Even folks in Introduction to Computing 102 will tell you that that is stupid.<br/><br/>I suppose that if you'd never seen a multithreaded application in your life, on first glance you might think that one which divides operational roles across multiple processes might be separate programs. Two points, however: one, you don't have that excuse, and two, it'd still be wrong.<br/><br/>There is a reason that players outnumber GMs, that's true, and it largely comes down to the difference in responsibilities with traditional game structure expectations. Traditionally, the GM has been expected to bring all the conflict to the table and to be responsible for everything going on in the world. In some games, that hinges on an abdication of personal representation. And you do touch on something that is interesting when you talk about the expectation that the GM be responsible for the other players at the table coming away with meaningful experiences.<br/><br/>But then you stomp all over that by saying that it's a desirable state.<br/><br/>But none of that separates the GM from the process of play. Quite the opposite, it embeds the GM in the process of play, it makes the GM wholly required to that structure of gameplay. The GM must be playing the game or the game is not played.<br/><br/>The reason that GMs have traditionally been outnumbered by players is that GMs don't need to exist in great numbers in traditional game structures \u2013 one GM for every four players or thereabouts has always been pretty good. Because that's the structure of gameplay.<br/><br/>We don't say that people don't want to be the banker in Monopoly because they don't get to play the game, or because they're playing a different game \u2013 they don't want to be the banker because it's annoying, and distracting, and incredibly embedded in the process in play of the game. (To the overall point, Monopoly almost became tolerable as a game design when the "banker" was replaced by cheap electronic cards and a machine that kept up with the numbers.)<br/><br/>And I would like to point out that we have several games \u2013 albeit generally not of the desktop variety \u2013 which are focused and concentrate and are fascinating because they are essentially games in which the players are automated in the GM is commanded by a human. The entire history of real-time strategy games is pretty much just that. The GM gives orders/create situations, the players react as best they can, enter cycle. The PC fantasy game Majesty is even more literally a representation of that architecture; the player controls the "King," whose only direct influence in the world is to decide what buildings are built, where they're built, and to set boundaries and rewards on things out in the world that they want accomplished by the automated agents. If you haven't played it, you really should \u2013 it's a great game. In the field of European boardgames, this is a sort of meta-architecture that occurs if not commonly, often enough to note. Power Station being one of the best examples that come to mind, where your cards give direction to the processes that exist as a result of game mechanics. In fact, any of the euro boardgames which have a solo play option probably count.<br/><br/>In none of these examples does anyone suggest that the directive agent, that the player, is not playing the game \u2013 even when they have a directive role, even when they're responsible for creating and bringing conflict, even when they do everything that a traditional RPG GM is expected to be doing. Because to suggest that they are not playing the game is dumb.<br/><br/>It's just not true.<br/><br/>Let's actually correct the obviously factually invalid portion of your post:<br/><br/>"The purpose of everyone that comes to the game table is to play, to engage with each other via the medium of a fictional world. In traditional games, one player's responsibility is for the game world as a whole and often for the facilitation of the system mechanics for all involved. The purpose of the system is to mediate conflict and provide structure within which all players can and will make interesting and meaningful decisions which have carry on effects. Some players receive gratification from play because they are given the chance to have emotional reactions to the fictional events of play. Some players receive gratification from play because other players recognize their contributions of fictional setting content, of crafted conflict, or of the monopoly of memorable characters and experiences. Some players receive gratification from play from overcoming tactical and systemic challenges, an opportunity to express the mastery of systems. Everyone, however, has come to play the game."<br/><br/>There's no need to introduce some sort of mysticism. There's no need introduce some kind of elitist architecture. All you have to do is report on what happens at an actual table.<br/><br/>I think what irks me most about your position is that it's so limiting, it's blinkered. Everything outside of a very narrow arc, everything that occurs in a way that you don't describe \u2013 which is almost everything, is implicitly inferior. And considering the fact that that's pretty much everything that everyone else is had some experience with in their own time with gaming, it makes you look like an idiot.<br/><br/>And I know you're not an idiot, so it puts me in an awkward position.<br/><br/>On a good day, I could just assume that you're trolling. Hades knows, Story Games is good for some trolling. To state philosophical counterfactuals as though they were known and expected by every person reading, that's some Ron Edwards-class shit there. That's exactly the right stick to stir this particular pile. I would totally understand that.<br/><br/>On a bad day, I have to start wondering if they are putting something in the water out in Vegas, something considerably stronger than bee venom. On a bad day, I have to look at the experiences I know you've had in the previous month and go, "I know he knows better. I've seen he knows better. I know that doesn't even accord with his experiences. So either he's high as balls, or he's building a philosophy which is explicitly in opposition to his own personal experience \u2013 which would be stupid."<br/><br/>So help me out. I know that Paul is engaging in good faith, because that's the kind of guy that Paul lists. I know that I'm fairly annoyed by anything that reeks of stupid, and doubly so from people whom I consider at least reasonable acquaintances, but at least as of today I'm not going out of my way to troll \u2013 I'm just telling you what I think and what I perceive. Like I said, help me out. Show me how this works in the context of being completely out of line with pretty much everything anyone else's experienced and how it's a useful guide to \u2013 anything, really, and I willing to at least give that response a gloss.<br/><br/>But this level of discourse? This stuff that you hung right above my head here? This is crap. It's like coming up to me while I'm staring at the sky, enjoying the clouds, and then shouting, "the sky is purple! Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes!?" The only reasonable response is to punch you in the face, and I really don't want to do that, man.

I really hope this thread doesn't turn into something personally damaging - this would be the dumbest shit ever to actually get upset at each other about (when little children are dying in Africa and new games aren't exactly <i>writing themselves</i>...).<br/><br/>However, Tod (AsIf), what Squidlord just said is in accord with my experiences (and preferences). For instance, when I told that story about the gaming community where people asked me, by way of greeting, "So, are you a <i>player</i> or a <i>GM</i>?" With eyes wide and expectant...<br/><br/>It made me want to turn and walk out of there. <br/><br/>There's this thing I call the "Mystery GM Cult", which perpetuates the idea that the act of GMing is somehow fundamentally different, that it's not "playing", that only certain select people are made for it - or perhaps even born to it - and that we're all better off if these mystical GMs do not share their secrets with the hoi polloi. Because sharing the secrets "behind the GM screen" will just take away the magic, "giving away the trick". Ugh.<br/><br/>I really don't like that idea. If nothing else, it limits our view of games and how to play them. As a designer, some of my best ideas have come about when I've tried to consciously break those assumptions. Some of my best gaming experiences have happened when people I was playing with threw away that mindset: for instance, a player who recognizes another character's role in the story as needing a certain foil, and then starts portraying their character as the sidekick/lover/rival that character needs, knowing full well that in the end it won't end well for them. They are effectively doing everything a GM would do, just from a "player's seat" - using one character - which is no different than what a GM does in that game when they portray a similar NPC. No different - same techniques, same goals, same skills.<br/><br/>Similarly, I've loved games where the players start framing scenes themselves - whether the official "system" permits it or not - it can enrich the game dramatically and make it feel like it's dancing along of its own volition.<br/><br/>And those are just easy examples which come along before we get into actual design questions, GMless games, and so on.<br/><br/>I find this mindset which sets the GM apart from the players, as a different type of participant - and a different type of <i>person</i> - is a very old-fashioned and close-minded attitude. It's great in a game of OD&amp;D, where it comes from, perhaps. But ultimately it's limiting and crippling, and it hurts other people's ability to play with those tools or become GMs themselves, when they see it as some kind of spiritual leap into another form of game. <br/><br/>We all do this stuff when we play games. That was one of the biggest breakthroughs that came from the Forge, I'd say; let's not regress to a more conservative view of gaming and drop everything we've learned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434489/#Comment_434489" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-27T18:18:37+00:00" title="June 27, 2014  6:18PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still not a fucking toaster, whatever my role in the group, I'm a human being, the opposite of a machine, and what I bring to the table is the opposite of the mechanical. <br/><br/>The <i>designer</i> might as well be a machine, probably some kind of brain-damaged toaster or something, whatever.

Including those things that are typically classified as "GM-less" etc.  When I read Alex's screed and review your yet-persistent line of doubt (or whatever word you want to use here), I try to think of something I haven't already said, but I can't.  It's all already up there.  Maybe he's just skimming me - I know Alex is a very busy guy, with his videogame reviews, podcasts, etc.  And that's probably one reason why he prefers the kinds of games he prefers.  (Alex makes no secret about the fact that he hates GMing - I have it on video!) :-&gt;<br/><br/>Back to you; I know you're reading me more closely.  The GM secret thing you're describing?  With the failure to incorporate any of the cool player-initiated ideas you just described, and thus obviously incapable of creating anything even deeper or more personally affecting than that?  Of course, I <i>have</i> seen that thing.  And who the fuck wants that?  Well, I guess teenagers with attitude problems.  Dude.  That's what I broke away <i>from,</i> just like you did.  But I didn't run in the same direction as The Forge.  I ran into different media experiments with different systems, larger audiences and less ramp-up, where I tried out a bunch of weird shit, learned a lot, and years later found my way here.  (Although I've also snarfed a number of reliable ideas from the works of Forge-ites I kept on my radar, some of which you may recognize occasionally.)  So I stand here as a relative outsider to what have become your "new traditional" assumptions (and you as a community <i>do</i> have those - I touched on that very briefly before, but I won't do it again in this thread because it deserves its own).  I think that's what makes me seem both (a) so familiar and (b) so fucking odd to some of y'all.  From where you stand, I probably fall into an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" rel="nofollow">Uncanny Valley</a>.<br/><br/>When I speak of fusion and becoming one with the machine - sometimes people say they're "one with the process", or "one with the flow, or "in the zone".  You hear this same thing said by videographers, racecar drivers, musicians, performance artists and technical wizards of all kinds - and it's not surprising in the least.  It's just true that some humans are motivated to relate this way to certain machines and systems, regardless of the medium or instrument we're talking about.  Likewise, some people are just unusually driven to continue finding new ways to express and share ideas, meaningful information and unique experiences, using those machines and systems.<br/><br/>Not everyone is so driven, even among practitioners of the same artform.  If you hear me and think "elitist", that's an ideological response.  I'm not pulling back just because someone calls me an elitist, when we all know this is true in every other artistic human endeavor.  Painting?  Racing?  Slide Guitar?  There are a few who are driven to push it as far as humanly possible, a few who really aren't driven at all, and a lot who are kinda ok with sometimes pushing a little bit. No matter what human trait or drive you measure, it's always a bell curve.  Why should we expect a different curve from the Art of GMing, which is basically a combination of other creative artforms, performance artforms, and dynamic logical processing?  Only ideology would convince someone that there isn't a tall, steep bell curve there.<br/><br/>In a word, what drives me is Art.  I unpacked that extremely dense word earlier, please forgive me if I don't repeat it all again.  I will here simply submit that there's a big difference between creating something that's fun and not too-illogical, and creating something with the weight of that word.  And that word is what I aim for as a GM.  I aim for Art.<br/><br/>That automatically means I'm a power-tripping tyrant who pisses on other people's creativity, thinks no one else can do what he does, and neither enjoys nor permits cooperative efforts, I suppose.  You really believe that?<br/><br/>When players totally surprise me I love it, because it not only indicates that they're fully engaged, but because it forces me and the system to flex our cyberbody in new directions.<br/><br/>When players jump to a "GM-like" level, that's fucking awesome and you bet your ass it becomes important.  Probably pivotal.  How could I ignore the gift of giving them back an even bigger gift?  I would have to be as stupid as Alex thinks I am!  There is nothing I can't tie back in (and I can say that with confidence because even if the rules lack some subsystem, I'm here with my non-toaster brain to fill in for it).  But if no players jump to that level, well, the system and I still know what to do.  We will still reach them.  That's why I say "reliable".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434494/#Comment_434494" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-27T19:40:32+00:00" title="June 27, 2014  7:40PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tod,<br/><br/>Right with you, man!<br/><br/>I suppose that what some of us are saying here is that:\n<blockquote> I can say that with confidence because even if the rules lack some subsystem, I'm here with my non-toaster brain to fill in for it [...]<br/></blockquote>\nThis "non-toaster" brain thing you're describing...

AW of course, was the place most of us first saw, elucidated and written down, a set of actual Principles we could look at when running the game.  ("running" the game - like "running" a program)<br/><br/>Anyway...  those of us with a certain philosophical attitude about control and faith in emergent narrative had been doing many or all of these things for years.  From the late 80s on up, exploration (and exhibition) of interactive narrative design was going on in LARPs and hypertheater, in interactive art installations, and even in more distant fields like CD-ROM game design and online virtual worlds.  As you know, Principles or core tenets like these provide guidance at all times while running the game.  But they can also serve a tactical purpose as "rules to fall back on when there aren't any more specific rules to fall back on."  This is where you find out what the kid does when the parent leaves the room.<br/><br/>I'll do one example from a game you're familiar with, and then later do another one from another game.  In "Apocalypse:Vegas", when the group was surrounded by angry bikers in Session 4, Dez removes her labcoat, hitting on her "Breathtaking" roll and momentarily stunning Grit, the lead biker dude.  Meanwhile Zeke the Faceless jumps up and grabs the guy, threatening to break his neck if anybody makes a move.  Hits it with a 13.  And in doing so, he levels up.  Now, the way things had been going up to this point, the bikers were nothing but a clear-cut enemy (brute threat), bent on revenge for their fallen comrades (killed, as suspected, by the PCs).  These guys were gonna show the players how nothing is stable in Apocalypse World, and shoot this infirmary all up.  It was in their portents and everything (I use DW portents).  Just waiting for the Hard Moves :-)  But Zeke's player, at that moment, right in the middle of combat, chooses to <i>acquire a Gang</i>.  Which, from his perspective, is a totally fucking logical thing to want at that moment, right?  But how can I make a Gang come out of nowhere?  That would feel weak and damage the immersion.  <i>(Shout-out to <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> - "immersion" as "suspension" of disbelief.)</i><br/><br/>So anyway.  There's no rule to tell me what to do.  I need to figure out what the system wants to do.  I hold up a time-out signal and tell the players I need a minute.  My thoughts go like this:<br/>1. I should wait; delay it til the end of the session, or at least the end of combat.  <br/>2. But I've been giving them to people immediately, that wouldn't be fair.<br/>3. But this is combat, maybe that's different.<br/>4. But the PCs are being AWESOME and totally deserve love right now.  (be a fan, intermittent rewards)<br/>5. But the only gang around is... Mm-hmm.<br/>6. But how could that be...  (thinking offscreen, looking through crosshairs)<br/>"Ok, I know what happens."<br/><br/>A shot rings out from the biker on the roof - taking out the man in Zeke's arms.   The second in command walks up and offers Zeke his hand.  "You'll have no trouble from us. Grit always was a pussy."  Boom.  Zeke gets himself a gang.<br/><br/><i>And from somewhere offscreen comes the faint sound of my entire Front turning into a whole different Front.</i><br/><br/>Like I said, Vincent made that easy to do in AW.  It's right there for you.  But in any game you play, there are always gonna be times you'll have to "read the system's mind".  The idea of "reading the system's mind" ("What would the system say?") is vastly preferable to asking "What do *<b>I</b>* want?" because thinking like <b>THAT</b> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would</span> create a basic opposition between me and the players.<br/><br/>My own ego.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434509/#Comment_434509" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-28T07:31:15+00:00" title="June 28, 2014  7:31AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2014 7:37AM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn it.

If you got a stake of $50 in a poker game and loose it all on one hand, the investment is gone, and so the immersion in the game. I think the same thing happens when there is talk about \xbbsuspension of belief\xab. You had a combat running, you created it, and it therefor became your investment. It's the same thing if a character in a movie, which you invested time and hopefully thought into, suddenly breaks the fourth wall. It can also happen when you got the hang of the setting (investment: mental image), like watching a cartoon, when it suddenly changes style from anime to Art Deco.<br/><br/>Suspense of belief is when your investment\u2014even if it's only a mental image of what's going on\u2014is being smashed into bits.<br/><br/>"Plot twist" is being introduced to something unexpected, but being able to adopt to it in a way so that the mental image isn't smashed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434510/#Comment_434510" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-28T08:08:18+00:00" title="June 28, 2014  8:08AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2014 10:21AM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think some people in this thread mostly sees the title of the thread and not the meaning in the thread. I already said that I agreed to what's been said, but only from AsIf's perspective, and it's mainly his opinions so I don't see the point of arguing about someone's opinions. It wont affect how I play anyway. The only thing I don't agree with is the same thing as what <a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">@Hasimir</a> brought up, and I really would like to see an answer to his question.<br/><br/>I would like to give another perspective to show how I interpret what AsIf is saying. I think <a href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000">@johnthedm7000</a> will benefit from reading the following as well, because I've been talking about interaction models <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19540/ideas-on-mechanics-to-encourage-emotional-investment-the-dark-roads/p1" rel="nofollow">in his thread</a>.<br/><br/>I would like to flatten out some of the game systems that are out there, by removing the game mechanics in favor in techniques. It's basically removing one type of structure for another. <i>Apocalypse World</i> is one of the game I would like to flatten out, because I don't really like the design of most of the moves. I should say that I haven't read the game, only (a lot) about the game, and I played one session of <i>Monster of the Week</i> while watching an hour of play of Apocalypse World.<br/><br/> I would like the moves to be a component in an interaction model. Instead of rolling for moves, I would see the moves each containing a <b>pool</b> of suggestions that the players could "choose one" or "choose three" from. The game master then has moves that all have the <b>trigger</b> "When the player uses a move: say yes, or do a move". This allows the game master to develop the situation.<br/><br/>What I described above is a <b>procedure</b> for interaction between the players and the game master. When the player do something, then the game master is allowed to use a responding move. It's my belief that this is more true to what the moves should be about\u2014creating interaction between the participants\u2014rather than projecting, through the use of dice and stats, some kind of illusion that it's game elements that we're using. "Ask provocative questions..." and "... build on the answers" should be moves to be used as responses to the players' actions, and not principles.<br/><br/>Now to the relevant part for this discussion. What this does, is through the removal of the dice in this example, letting the game master instead be a part of the system. It's a game system that <i>forces</i> the game master to become one with the system\u2014to interpret when to use moves and which moves to use. It's a game system that relies, even if it's controlled by the trigger, on the judgement of the game master.<br/><br/>(Someone might recognize all this as <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/434459#Comment_434459" rel="nofollow">accepting-offering</a> that I just talked about.

But functionally it is more far-reaching: it both forces the human part to take over more functions, and (because it removes one major "recognizable dynamic trait" from the mechanics) cripples the human's ability to "read the mind" of the rules.<br/><br/>It's a question of having something to emulate vs. not having something to emulate.  You see, when creating custom mechanics in the vein of "What would the system say?", the styles, structures and tones of the existing mechanics are my best guidelines to follow.  They provide the "spirit" of the game's mechanics.  Their existence is not merely functional and tactical but - to the GM - structurally descriptive and normative (for the system from which they come).  Therefore while I agree in general that fewer mechanics typically make for better games, I would rue the loss of such a <i>defining</i> mechanic, when it comes to understanding the style and flow of narrative *this particular system* is trying to attain.<br/><br/><i>Metaphor: It's hard to form a relationship with someone who displays no traits.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434551/#Comment_434551" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-29T10:38:19+00:00" title="June 29, 2014 10:38AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2014 10:42AM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That's interesting, Rickard. How is this version of Apocalypse World different from the game as-written?</blockquote>\nThe major difference is how it's executed through play. Baker has gone the Robin D Laws way of mechanize techniques to ease people in to use the techniques. For example: investigator skills in <b>Esoterrorist</b> aren't really skills but advice for the game master. While it is a successful formula, I would rather see that the game text talked about structures of play and procedures for communicating, and do that by turning the social rules, and how we communicate, in real life into structures. These two are, of course, already structures that we follow in real life but unspoken ones.<br/><br/><b>Apocalypse World</b> got it's principles, but I think some can be turned into moves, and some should be the spirit that are in all moves, like Barf Forth Apocalyptica. I love the idea of mantras, where you repeat a sentence to form your state of mind. They work really well in play, and I have used it myself in one of my own games called <b>Mutin\xe9</b>. It was a game of action heroes, and two mantras that the game master always should repeat was "They are action heroes" so that the players could get away with ridiculous actions, and the other were "If they can do it in an easy way, then they can do it in a hard way". The last one meant that if a character can shoot someone in the face, then they can instead run up a wall, do a flip and shoot someone in the face. The result is the same (someone gets hurt), it's only a difference in execution.<br/><br/>But I want to develop beyond using mantras, and that's a thought I'm toying around with at the moment. To turn mantras,  like Barf Forth Apocalyptica, into the theme/genre/feeling of the game, presenting them early, and then <i>reinforce it constantly </i>for every new mechanic that I introduce. So if I sell the Barf Forth Apocalyptica theme early in the game, then the hypothetical move Ask Provocative Questions (and the many along it) should reinforce the setting through it's pool of suggestions. <b>Polaris</b>  does this already, as an example.<br/><br/>What I also think is important is to create a synergy between the players' moves and the game masters, perhaps by adding conditions to the moves that explains when to use the moves or having a list of suggested responses (through moves) to the players' moves. The players moves' should also control what kind of interaction that is supposed to happen within the game. One outside example I can think of, is the escalation in <b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b>. The escalation is a decision made by either part and is not really part of a rule mechanic, but imagine if the escalation in itself was a move. What kind of trigger would it have, and what could be it's condition for using it? (Another example could be a Sword Fighting skill from a trad game. The move would be about <i>when</i> to use the skill.)<br/><br/>I don't think you need principles like "Make your move, but misdirect." or "Make your move, but never speak its name." if you focus on when to use the moves instead of how to use them. Those mantras could instead be baked into all the moves.<br/><br/>These are fairly new ideas for me, and they are elaborations from playing, and designing, similar games for the past seven years. I guess I need to make a game to show people what I mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434552/#Comment_434552" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-29T10:54:40+00:00" title="June 29, 2014 10:54AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2014 12:43PM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I would rue the loss of such a <i>defining</i> mechanic, when it comes to understanding the style and flow of narrative *this particular system* is trying to attain.<br/><br/><i>Metaphor: It's hard to form a relationship with someone who displays no traits.</i></blockquote>\nAs explained in the post above: the moves enforce the theme of the game (of why to play the game) through the pool of suggestions and triggers/conditions. So I'm not really removing, only redesigning, but doing it by including the game master as part of the system.<br/><br/>I've already made <b>Mutin\xe9</b>, and played it for five years, that adopted itself to the players' actions. They wanted to do something, and then the game master chose an appropriate mechanic to use, based on what they would achieve instead of how the action is executed. I think it's possible to do the same for the game master, much like an exoskeleton. The game master wants to do something, within the limits of the system, and the exoskeleton execute the order within it's range of possibilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434553/#Comment_434553" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-29T11:09:27+00:00" title="June 29, 2014 11:09AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2014 2:58PM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree it's possible.  It would have to be written very carefully, and certain words would need to have very specific definitions in order to avoid misinterpretation.  I would also suggest increasing the conceptual chunk-size of the moves whenever possible until they become more like general "classes" or "patterns" of actions/effects.  Keep the number of options low as possible.  Definitely below 6.  3 is great.  Could work.<br/><br/>But note that we have now introduced two other challenges, one for GMs and one for the designers: (1) it's very easy to internalize the logic of a simple bell curve, while it's much harder (and takes longer) to mentally prioritize or envision probabilities for a list of verbal descriptions, and (2) if we get too vague, the system might become so abstract it runs the risk of causing player paralysis (the "deer in the headlights" problem) or becoming so generic it reaches the level of a "parody engine" (e.g.: Roll for Shoes).*<br/><br/>The simplest possible parody engine is a game I call "Win or Lose".

Let's not fool ourselves; if the argument is that there are innumerable ways to fail -- that's true. But each of them are different, it's not just one "failure," and if there are innumerable ways to fail, there are innumerable ways to break that failure as well. If you want to increase the liklihood of someone at the table being able to turn failures in experience into successes, you need more people with the capability to.<br/><br/>That, in my mind, reflects one of the biggest weaknesses of the traditional gaming model. One person at the table is responsible for bringing the conflict, for maintaining the community, for building the story, for avoiding the potholes, and for keeping the car out of the ditches. There are a lot of ditches. That, in a nutshell, is why for myself, I hate the traditional GMing model. It's aggravated by the fact that everybody at the table recognizes that form of social contract and if most of them are experienced gamers, that's their "default operating mode," building a base of assumption from which to actually play the game.<br/><br/>I did that for 20 years. I was (and in many ways still am) the omni-GM of my social group. I'm the neophile and I'm the one fascinated by design in general. That means that I get stuck not only being Facilitator but before I could essentially find it in myself to put my foot down and say, "this far and no further" and effectively refusing to run more traditionally architected GM-full designs, being stuck as and only as a GM.<br/><br/>When a game fails in a traditionally architected GM-centric format, we put it on the head of the GM. It's his responsibility. It's his failure. We talk about dysfunctional groups all the time, and how they can be dysfunctional, but when the failure comes the GM takes the rap. That's the nature of the architecture, because the GM is the only one with both the socially contracted responsibility and the mechanically contracted power to rescue any particular failure mode. The non-GM players don't actually have it as their job to make the car go. (One of the potential failure modes and categorically dysfunctional group dynamics is for one or more of the non-GM players to take it on as their personal crusade to introduce some sort of failure mode. Every GM has a list of places where they have hidden the bodies of such people.)<br/><br/>Now, back to where I came in on this, compare this to group collaborative games where responsibility and power are distributed across the group by some means. Yes, you increase the possibility that one of those people will have a "fatal tic" that introduces the potential for everyone to have less fun than they might otherwise \u2013 to greater or lesser degree a "failure". But you commensurately, compared to a traditional GM-full architecture, increase vastly the probability and allow for the possibility that someone else at the table has the knowledge, talent, or chutzpah to turn that fatal tic into a non-event at worst and possibly even into an experience that nobody would've had otherwise \u2013 in a positive sense.<br/><br/>In my heart, I am still an engineer \u2013 my first calling, my first training, and my first career. In that time I learned one of the most important things in developing and making anything: fail early, and fail often. The earlier you fail the less bad you feel about it because you're not heavily invested into whatever it was. The more often you fail, the more you know that you're trying something at the edge of your capability and you become inured to the idea that failure is possible, likely if you're extremely experimental, and okay to accept \u2013 it allows you to move on to something else that very well might work without carrying some sort of crushing burden.<br/><br/>This is equally applicable to gaming in the context of finding something with your group that works. One of the big differences I've observed between traditional GM-full game design and collaborative GM-less design is that the latter \u2013 if it's truly not a fit for the group \u2013 fails out earlier and with less emotional overhead. Traditional GM-full designs can go on quite a while before the fatal tic, whatever it is, strikes home, and that leaves a lot of people in emotional turmoil, because they've invested a lot of their time and personal effort in playing this game. As a GM they're frustrated because they feel responsible and the mechanics emphasize their responsibility. As a player they're frustrated because someone else is failing them. All kinds of strife falls out, and that is the opposite of fun. If your group is absolutely not going to enjoy a collaborative, GM-less game \u2013 and those groups exist, those people exist; there is not One True Way, despite what people will tell you \u2013 better for it to fail on you early than for you to get six months into a campaign and suddenly realize that the GM is failing you, or that the GM's interpretation of the rules is failing you, or that the rules are failing you in the GM is faithfully executing them, or that the social contract is failing you and you feel disempowered to do anything about it.<br/><br/>In my opinion, anyway.<br/><br/>In my experience, the actual frequency of GM-less games failing is roughly equal to those of more traditionally GM-full designs. When they work for a group, they really work for group and they are very happy. When they don't work for a group, that failure happens early, then move on to something else, and they very well might come back to it later when they've shifted some perspective. So from a na\xefve position, just looking at "new game starts," that fail early trait can make it look like they have a much higher fail often quality, but that's not actually the case.<br/><br/>We have to be careful about the implications of saying things like "there are too many cooks that the game has to rely on," because the ultimate expression of that is a recognition that the best gameplay you'll ever have, consistently and ongoingly, is by yourself \u2013 making sure that the taint of other people can never enter the temple of your holy gaming. Now, I don't know about you, but even though most of my personal romantic relationships have ended in fire and screams, I'm not quite ready to give up sex in favor of masturbation. Just putting that on the table.<br/><br/>We need to be aware and actively engaged with the fact that the social contract, the structure of expectations at the table, is both incredibly important and largely outside the domain of what the game itself as a product and as an artifact is responsible for. If we want different social contracts we have to be willing and interested to experiment with radically different game designs that distribute responsibility, that distribute power, that distribute narrative in very different ways than what has been traditional. Have to be very careful to avoid philosophies which cut away the space of possibility of new exploration and of, by extension, theoretical new social contracts which could grow out of those explorations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434559/#Comment_434559" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-29T12:31:00+00:00" title="June 29, 2014 12:31PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That matches my experience, too:<br/><br/>When people talk of "failure rates" with GMless games, it's usually in reference to a group of traditional gamers trying out such a game for the first time.<br/><br/>The reason this is misleading is because they already have years of experience, skills, and default modes for playing traditional RPGs.<br/><br/>Give a "cyber game" (i.e. traditional RPG with a GM) and a GMless modern story game to a group that's <i>never played either before</i>, and I'm not so convinced that the latter would generally fail while the former would always be smooth sailing.

But the solution I have in mind is not describing the purpose of the rules with the rule text, because that will lead to a clogged up text. What I have in mind is instead to early describe the purpose of the game. Not only to get the right people to play it, or to plant a certain thought into their heads, but to make them do more than only understand how the structures (techniques and game mechanics) of the game work. To make the structures constantly reinforce the purpose of the game will make people grok the structures - to understand the purpose of those structures.<br/><br/>This is another reason why I don't find the design of <b>Apocalypse World</b> appealing. Yes, principles and moves works, but it can probably work in a better way by combining the principles with the moves like I have described before.

But sure, I'll elucidate.  As I understand it, Hasimir's question was "How can I say this approach is more reliable in terms of generating a meaningful and artistic experience for the players?"  This is the question I'll be answering below.  But before I do that, some notes on terminology are in order.<br/><br/><b>What is GMing vs What is Not GMing</b><br/>Firstly, because for some reason it isn't patently obvious to some people, I need to make clear that throughout this entire thread, I've been talking only about RPGs which involve GMs.  (If you can think of another medium in which the words "GM" and "Player" are used, let me know, because this seemed pretty obvious to me.)  It would be slightly impossible to talk about GMing in games where no GMs are involved, as far as I can tell.  The OP and several posts since have mentioned "distributed GMs" (which is not the same thing as "No GMs"), and I don't exclude those games from consideration here.  But it seems that the locally-sanctioned use of these well-known words is slippery compared to the common understanding.  We may need to invent some more precise terms, if only to prevent members of the community from getting obnoxiously pedagogical or attacking others for using these words as they are typically understood.  Personal attacks and insulting rebuttals do in fact occur over this stuff, even among otherwise civil company, and this either implies that the community tacitly supports dickish pedantry, or that our words are failing us.  That's why I say "GM-less" (or "GM-Full") games really ought to be called something else entirely, while <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> suggests that it's the GM'd games that might need another name.  So far the typical solution has just been to stretch the definition of the word "GM" to near-meaninglessness, guaranteeing further confusion, discord and argument.  Fuck that.  I am sticking with the original functional definition, regardless of how many people perform those functions.<br/><br/><b>Reliable, Meaningful, Artistic</b><br/>It's important to keep all three of these values in mind, because they are all equally important performance goals for me.  It's possible to create systems that are "reliable" only to the extent that the content they generate isn't completely nonsensical, but I aim higher than that.  This not my pastime but my Artform, and I take it very seriously.  Because of this, players who become regular members of my groups are those who appreciate those values themselves and approach the Art with a similar amount of creative seriousness.<br/><br/>Ok.  Now that the disclaimers are out of the way, let's get on to the exegesis.<br/><br/><b>Discipline and Experience</b><br/>The simplest answer to <a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir%27s">@Hasimir's</a> question is that unlike the players, I spend a very large percentage of my time reading, writing, and thinking about narrative and interactive structures in all media including but not limited to RPGs, with the deliberate intention of seeking out systems and elements that could be put to good use in interactive fiction, either mechanically, structurally, or as content.  Add to this thousands of hours spent studying works from related fields, such as literary arts, performing arts, systems theory, game theory, psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, computer programming, interface design, etc., not to mention the time spent literally practicing my discipline directly (i.e., running games).  I spend all this time doing all these things - including reading and posting here, btw - because I just happen to be the type of person who is driven to design interactive experiences, and therefore I see these studies as valuable additions to both my designer's and GM's toolkits.  If you're reading this, chances are you're the same way.  This is not surprising: it's why <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> has his "We Know So Little" thread, for instance.  It's why I'm working on a manuscript called "The History of Interactive Fiction".  It's why many of us write blogs, to pursue and share knowledge - both direct and allegorical - that only people like us care about.  But to expect or require a similar amount of thought or prepwork to be done by any player just to get into a game - that would be unreasonable as well as unreliable, and would filter out almost every potential player who isn't also a GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434656/#Comment_434656" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-01T15:06:12+00:00" title="July  1, 2014  3:06PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2014 11:01AM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's possible that the above doesn't sound like a real answer to you, but rather a simple explanation of personality types.  So for those who are interested, I can go into much more detail about my actual processes.  Here we go.<br/><br/><b>What I'm Doing</b><br/>My default approach to GMing begins with a trad setup, where the rules adjudicate things like action resolution, encounter generation, moves and transactions, while I serve as an "data input operator" who plugs data into the rules and determines/communicates the system's response.  This is the "slave to the rules" thing I've been accused of (Rule 0 notwithstanding), although it's merely the most mechanical part of the cyber-GM's functions.  No mind-reading is necessary to do this.  Please note: If this was a full explanation of my position (as some yet persist in assuming), there would have been no need for me to have written the OP at all.<br/><br/>The other part of the cyber-GM is the human part, whose goal is Art and whose method is Meaning.  Meaning is created by paying attention to psychologically-charged details or signifiers arising from the players themselves, drawing connections between them, and injecting them back into play in dramatic ways at opportune moments.  I call this player-generated stuff "psychic content" (I can already hear someone charging me with "mysticism" - so before you waste your time, look up the meaning of the word "psychic" - you will find that the primary definition has nothing to do with ESP, and I shall keep my ideas about ESP entirely out of this).  To obtain psychic content, I prompt and question my players a lot, I engage in NPC dialog a lot, I feed their own words and symbols back to them a lot and I carefully watch what happens.  I am not just an output unit for the rules' determinations, but a dedicated processor for human stuff: meaningful symbolism, unconscious motivations (either character level or IRL, preferably both), and logical but unseen connections between the things players say and the rest of the gameworld.  Once psychic content has been attached to a story element in this way, it becomes what we might call a "Bleed Hook".  I like that phrase.  A Bleed Hook gives me a handle on some ephemeral detail which is likely to bring about strong emotional responses from one or more players when re-introduced.  <br/><br/>With me so far?<br/><br/><b>What The Group Is Doing</b><br/>When I'm GMing, the group works rather like a team of TV writers creating a soap opera, where each writer is predominantly responsible for a particular character's storyline (this is the way many soap operas and ensemble dramas are written).  But simultaneously, every TV series also has a "Lead Writer" who acts mainly in service to overall continuity (this is often the person who "invented" the concept of the show and wrote the pilot episode), and every series has a "bible" (which is basically the TV industry word for a sourcebook).<br/><br/>Together the rules and I play a role which is more like a narrative support system than an executive director.  The role of the cyber-GM in relation to the group certainly has some "directorly" functions in it, but also includes continuity maintenance functions, lead writer functions, fact consultant functions, "bible" functions, stage crew functions, supporting actor functions and more.  My players have a huge amount of narrative freedom and are able at any time to step up and perform any of these functions by simply making a suggestion.  In play, however, most of them don't actually spend a lot of time performing these functions (which is a matter of preference and personality).  This kind of "GM-ly" input simply pops up randomly whenever a player has a GM-ly idea and steps up with it.  But as for the system and I, we don't get off so easily.  We need to keep things flowing whether a player steps up or not, or the whole experience will lag.  We accept that responsibility.  That's what we came onboard to do.<br/><br/>Because my players have the ability to inject "GM-ly" ideas but are under no particular pressure to do so, we get very few of the lame, obvious, or silly suggestions made by headlight-impaled deer such as you often get in "GM-less" games.  My approach allows each player to focus as exclusively as they wish upon developing their own story arcs with full authorial agency and directionality up to any point where a resolution is required (a move, an interaction with an NPC, or the triggering of some "world-based" event such as a trap, weather, etc).  Their agency halts there temporarily, because it's both pointless and boring to let people set up their own problems AND knock them down (i.e., the Czege Principle).  So instead, when a player states something that requires a resolution, the system and I go into "resolution mode".  Our job in this mode is to work together to help answer the question of HOW (or how well) the described action happens or fails to happen.  If there is no rule covering the situation, I rely on the "spirit" of the rules to create a custom set of likely responses which operates in harmony with both the existing mechanics and the psychic content currently being explored.  This is the technique I call <i>"What would the system say?"</i>  If the attempted action is successful, the plot moves forward in the way the player was intending.  If it fails, the plot moves forward but in some other way, generally a complication, depending on the spirit of the system and colored by all the psychic content I've gleaned from all my questions and prompts.  Either way, plot moves forward, meaningless content is avoided, and a large amount of psychic content is produced, lending itself to subsequent meaningful interactions.<br/><br/>That's why I say "reliable".<br/><br/><div><i>"Good GMship is underlying the storytelling work to create evocative, fully sensual environments, but letting the players drive, in a way.

Though I'd say the word "controlled" is not really accurate.  The cyber-GM has no more control than your computer exercises over you.  While I do "control" most elements of the gameworld, the Players have much more control over the direction of the emergent plot than I do.  They're the ones who produce psychic content in the first place, they're the ones who choose which hooks and prompts to which they'll respond, and how.  My campaigns are sandboxes.  Psychic sandboxes :-)<br/><br/>In games where the responsibilities of the GM are shared or move around, I believe the same techniques could still be used, as long as the GM people were similarly committed and similarly familiar with the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19525/gamemastering-i-want-to-be-a-machine" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19525/gamemastering-i-want-to-be-a-machine" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19525/gamemastering-i-want-to-be-a-machine/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19525%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19525%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
