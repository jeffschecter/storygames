We (the players) more or less consciously look for opportunities to use them. "So... they're discussing the price of Mangoes, huh? CONFLICT!" It's hard not to use them when they're there, they're gamer magnets. Yet they often interfere with play.<br/><br/>For me, it's kind of like having naked girls in a movie. No matter what the plot is, as soon as those girls get on screen I kind of forget about the movie and go "hey, naked girls!" Not because I think they're the coolest thing in the movie, or add anything to the plot, but they sure are attention magnets.<br/><br/>My point? Just because it's fun to play with systems, doesn't mean they actually enhance the play experience for me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111594/#Comment_111594" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T09:43:35+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  9:43AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I've had that experience. Definitely. It's one reason I tend to think that those sorts of fiddly bits work best for games that have a tight focus. When the fiddly bits are pointing me at and driving me toward the thing I came to the game to do, COOL! When they're a distraction, not so much.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I've definitely seen the opposite in action, too. Players avoiding engagement with the conflict resolution system because they don't want to risk it not going their way or they find it fiddly and annoying for procedural reasons, and thus holding up any <i>progression</i> in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111596/#Comment_111596" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T09:47:54+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  9:47AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had the opposite experience as well, particularly with Dogs.

If your game does not support a certain action, people will want to do it and either be frustrated or find a way to do it (the former especially when you say "No, you can't do X in this game.")  But if you provide a mechanical disincentive, you keep choice around of whether or not to do X, but in a way that psychologically impresses the idea to not do X anyway.  This concept works because mechanical bits are magnetic.<br/><br/>It's funny how gaming accidents can turn into gaming ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111683/#Comment_111683" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T13:33:35+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  1:33PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Off the cuff:<br/><br/>* Scripted Fight! was such a turnoff to my main fighty players in my big BW game that they started avoiding it, which is a drag to the guys who want to be fighty. The game did an excellent job of expressing the notion that resorting to violence sucks. <br/><br/>* I think a mechanically "fun" system can sucker players into messing with game elements they normally don't want to, with mixed results. Like...the Aspects system in SotC. Fun fun FUN for the tacticians to dream up new ways to write Aspects so they can invoke them for effect. However, the tacticians don't get off on systems where they introduce their own facts and situations -- they prefer to "beat" the GM's situations of his design.<br/><br/>* Giving something mechanical weight in a game might not highlight it as "important" but it seems inevitable that it's highlighted as "beatable". Do you want your important things to be beatable?
