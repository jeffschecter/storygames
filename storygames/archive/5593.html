And not just "oh, I boned that roll, so I flubbed what I was trying to do", but situations where they know what they're going to do is going to get them into trouble and it's not in their best interests but they do it anyway. He gave an example of a knight slaying a magical maiden in the court of a king and getting into trouble thereby.<br/><br/>This segued into a related topic, the "incredibly detailed and drawn out planning session".<br/><br/>I've got some observations on these topics, because I think it's an area where my game group's play could be improved.<br/><br/>There is one player in the group that does all the plans. He's the one that's most charismatic and forceful and so his ideas are virtually always accepted.  If someone comes up with another idea, he's always willing to listen and take their idea, but nothing goes forward unless he signs off on it. And it drives him crazy when he hears other players considering having their characters take actions that he considers mistakes, he energetically (usually in a positive and constructive way) corrects them.<br/><br/>There's another player who really doesn't pay a whole lot of attention to the game, she's mainly just there to hang out with others, and as a result she constantly makes all sorts of mistakes from the mundane to the sublime. I had difficulties with her until we figured out she doesn't like to have bad things happen to her character, so I stopped having her mistakes (or any actions) have any negative consequences and we've been cool.<br/><br/>What's interesting is that the Planner knows and sees this but continues to correct her, and to try to get her on board with the plans!<br/><br/>There's a lot of learned behavior here, and I'm getting a bit far afield from my eventual topic, so bear with me. <br/><br/>More soon.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125247/#Comment_125247" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T13:51:42+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  1:51PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to let you know.

Because to some degree I don't think it's really about trying to avoid mistakes in the sense of getting into new and disadvantageous situations, it's more about <i>managing risk</i>.  The big planning session typically happens when the decision has already been made - sometimes way back at the beginning of the game when we decided to play SWAT team members or vampires or whatever - to get into the risky situation, and the plan is there in order to either reduce negative consequences if they occur, or reduce the chances that they'll occur.<br/><br/>Thus the Planner's characters, usually snarky, say things along the lines of 'oh great, look what you've gotten us into NOW, well, what are we going to do to get out of it? let's start with...'<br/><br/>What's interesting to me is that after years of playing with this group, I have somewhat stopped even evaluating the plans made.  I know they'll be tactically sound past the level of my focus.  And I've said this. And the plans still get made!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125271/#Comment_125271" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T14:29:10+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  2:29PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Way on the other side of this thing is my wife, whose characters most commonly (amongst this group) do the things that the poster in the other thread classified as mistakes. She likes playing "crazy" characters - the Malkavians in Vampire, the loopy psychic in Firefly, and so on.  And when she is "on", playing her character to the hilt, she is never in any doubt about what her character will do next, consequences be damned.  Her characters are, in those moments, both confident and unshakeable, and often very wrong.  The Planner doesn't mind this at all, interestingly.  I think he is able to rationalize that my wife's <i>characters</i> don't care about being wrong, whereas the casual player <i>herself</i> doesn't care about being wrong.  As a result, he sees my wife's characters as another part of the game world that can (must?) be risk-managed, but can't do so with the casual player.<br/><br/>Example from my recent Star Wars d20 game. The characters were fleeing a successful attack on an Imperial shipyard in two stolen gunboats. The chances that they'll escape without a fight are slim, there's literally open, laser-beam combat taking place in every 3D direction.  But there's a slim chance they might be able to bluff. I say "The lead TIE Fighter hails you..." But my wife was so psyched and excited over the successful theft, previous combat, dashing swashbuckling and space adventure that she interrupted me and blurted out, very loudly and happily, "HI!"  The group collapsed laughing.  What I loved about it was that it was perfectly in-character, driven largely by out-of-character emotion, and it gained no advantage whatsoever.  And suddenly there was no way this could be risk managed! They started rolling initiative! It was great!<br/><br/>This led me to think back and there have been several instances where my wife's characters have done things that have escalated things for the group and it's <i>never been a bad out-of-character experience, ever.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125273/#Comment_125273" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T14:34:11+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  2:34PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><i>And it drives him crazy when he hears other players considering having their characters take actions that he considers mistakes, he energetically (usually in a positive and constructive way) corrects them.</i></b><br/><br/><b><i>What's interesting to me is that after years of playing with this group, I have somewhat stopped even evaluating the plans made.

The players needed to deal with a Black Dragon in his swamp lair. They dedicated pretty much all the session to plan and prepare their big and success-warrant strategy. They reckoned every possible and perceived risk... And in the end, the big bad dragon surprised them from behind. They never really thought that they were <b>just outside</b> his "front door", and never during the preparation process did they worry about leaving someone to check the dragon wasn't spying on them... Of course, most of my players were 15 back then... Heh!<br/><br/>The second one was one in which I was one of the PCs. We had this Mission:Impossible kind of quest. To retrieve a dark relic from a heavily guarded evil temple. The stakes were really high. We weren't only risking our lives (and possible our souls), but the safety of many people too. And since we got to bribe a double-crossing cleric and got some blue prints and stuff, we decided to make this big plan... We agreed to gather one day (without the DM, so he wouldn't have time to anticipate our plan), and spent literally hours making strategies and contingency plans.<br/><br/>Our plan failed, of course. It seemed no one but me remembered that one of the Top Priorities was to not let any guard raise the alarm... It didn't matter in the end. We had already got far enough, and in the end we succeeded. Luck was on our side, and our plan was not all that bad. But I still believe the more important part was that we all had a great time, both during planning and during the adventure. Well, at least most of us.<br/><br/>I did got a big bunch of extra experience both for staying in character and for being the <i>de facto</i> leader of the party and main proposer of the whole thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125287/#Comment_125287" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T15:18:59+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  3:18PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>As a result, he sees my wife's characters as another part of the game world that can (must?) be risk-managed, but can't do so with the casual player.</blockquote>And, this, right here, is the part of it that is sucky (or can be). The Planner is approaching the game as a problem to be solved - apply resources, circumvent risks, achieve objectives. The thing is, from that perspective, the other PCs are just resources and/or obstacles. They need to be managed or "walled off" in order for the Planner to get his happy. As long as everybody has a shared goal, though, it doesn't have to matter too much, but as soon as one of other PCs has an idea that isn't part of the plan and can't be walled off -- CONFLICT.<br/><br/>This means that the other players aren't really allowed to have their own priorities and agendas unless those are entirely orthogonal to the Problem and don't intersect with it. Or, alternatively, that the planner never gets to make a plan that works.<br/><br/>I've been in both spots - I've been the Planner in a group of scenery-chewers and casual players (although really my job was firewall between the GM and the other players - I had to do all the planning so that they could have their own plot threads without getting stomped by the adversarial GM) and I've watched as a table of Planners and casual players utterly shut down the one player at the table whose character had anything resembling a life goal other than Beat The Next Fight.<br/><br/>It's great when you can juggle these priorities in play, but my experience is that that only really works when you've only got one alpha personality with a strong goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125288/#Comment_125288" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T15:25:06+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  3:25PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite><br/>The Elaborate Plan is an interesting phenomenon.

We weren't making elaborately detailed plans because it would be fun when they went to hell...we made elaborately detailed plans in the hopes that this time maybe we'd GET IT RIGHT.  Maybe this time we could finally cover all the bases, and we'd be the awesome superninjas who ghosted in, did the job, and ghosted out without a hitch.  Maybe we could engineer a "Hey bad guys, fuck you" moment where the part that they thought would screw us would actually screw <i>them</i>, and then we'd be laughing at <i>their</i> expense for a change.<br/><br/>Besides, the worst-case Shadowrun plan mishaps usually ended in TPKs, which really cuts the whole "mistakes are where the fun begins" concept off at the knees.  Mistakes that stop the game entirely or sideline 3/4 of the players because they have to make new characters are where the fun ENDS.  In an old-school killer-GM game, not having a plan (or having a bad plan) was the same as tearing up your character sheet...or an invitation to the (somewhat contrived and unsatisfying) deus ex machina rescue.

The Planner is approaching the game as a problem to be solved - apply resources, circumvent risks, achieve objectives. The thing is, from that perspective, the other PCs are just resources and/or obstacles. They need to be managed or "walled off" in order for the Planner to get his happy. As long as everybody has a shared goal, though, it doesn't have to matter too much, but as soon as one of other PCs has an idea that isn't part of the plan and can't be walled off -- CONFLICT.<br/>I got a slightly different impression from it, actually -- it sounded to me more like an alpha player who's working around an involved, interested player whose gaming preferences are different from his own (giving the wife room to do her thing in a way that doesn't result in conflict with his own preferences), and also trying to include/engage/draw in a casual player who seems less involved and interested in what's going on in the game (by "correcting" her and trying to get her on board with his plans).<br/><br/>Of course, if the casual player doesn't get off on the whole planning/risk management thing, this strategy really isn't going to get her more involved at all, and then neither of them will be happy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125310/#Comment_125310" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T17:00:28+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  5:00PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AfT is right on target with the dynamic, I think.<br/><br/>And the thread got to where (I think) I was going a lot faster than I did!<br/><br/>The Planning is fun <i>in and of itself</i>.

Like the most recent one involved him trying to convince the party that they should climb up on the roof of this building to sneak around some ogres, when several party members (including him) were in full plate, and we beat the ogres handily once we got to them.  <br/><br/>He mostly plays Shadowrun, which accounts for the planning.  As to the craziness, the best we've been able to figure out, is that he must think that if he comes up with something out there enough, the GM won't have figured out any obstacles for it, and will just have to let it work, or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125318/#Comment_125318" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T18:04:11+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  6:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The only way to ever separate these two things is to have characters with some emotional drive that overrides the "better sense" that triggers the planning session.</blockquote>\nYah. That's more or less where I was headed. If the planning, in itself, is the main kick for the alpha(s) in the group, then anything that makes the plan not run smoothly is Not Fun. If the Plan is just the starting point for emergent action driven by character decisions, situation, and chance, then the Plan working smoothly and without a hitch is Not Fun.<br/><br/>Most often, the real preferences of the group are somewhere in between, and you get the "bubbles of freedom" within the Plan effect. If the bubbles are big enough not to feel constraining, everybody has fun. If the bubble gets broken, the Planner doesn't have fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125553/#Comment_125553" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T11:56:14+00:00" title="February 10, 2008 11:56AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, I think I see what most of the posts are getting at - analyzing when people do alot of planning even when the plan "doesn't matter" or even when it's "better" when the plan "fails" - but in practice most of the time lack of planning led to TPK or Getting Other player's PCs killed, which then resulted in a tendency to "overplan" to avoid these bad outcomes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother version of this is when the GM is vague about planning matters. I remember asking my GM once to explicitly promise script immunity for PCs, in part so I wouldn't have to be so anal retentive about planning and scheming. He refused to promise one way or another. I think he basically extended de facto script immunity (no one ever die in that campaign, and there were alot of deus ex machina bailouts of the party or individuals) but by refusing to _promise_ script immunity I still ended up wasting time planning, min maxxing, etc. to prevent that potential TPK.

A truly bone-headed "plan" that culminates in Han Solo <i>totally screwing up</i>. "We're all fine here... now. How are you?" About half the time, I play the type of character that will happily use his worst skill (or one that isn't even on his sheet) at some critical juncture. "Of course I can trick the master spy! C'mon... it's me!" Playing reckless, lovable characters is super fun.<br/><br/>The other half of the time, I like to play no-nonsense, by-the-numbers <i>experts</i>. True professionals who know their shit, always have a plan, and don't make stupid mistakes. Things don't always go their way, but they are always mitigating risk and demonstrating their superior skills.<br/><br/>(The third half of the time, who knows? I may play any kind of character.)<br/><br/>What I expect from my fellow players (and try to give in return) is support. If I want to play the reckless troublemaker, support me! If you want to play the ultra-careful risk-avoider, I'll support you. What we won't do is judge each other and whine about how the game is "supposed" to be played. What we will do is trust each other, toss good material to each other, and push each other's comfort zones a little or a lot.<br/><br/>After I play the sixth character in a row as a reckless jackass, you can say, "Hey, John. You wanna try something different this time, maybe?" I don't want to stay in a rut, our egos aren't on the line, and we're there to support each other.<br/><br/>Sounds like your group has the support thing going on JD. Not so much the "get out of the rut" thing, but that's cool. There's nothing wrong with sticking to your thing if that's what's most fun. But if I regularly played with your risk-mitigating, plan-gatekeeper guy, we would have a talk. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125622/#Comment_125622" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T16:50:45+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  4:50PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Planning is fine in many games, but sometimes I've found my self getting fed up with the party of heroes coming upon something scary, like a door, and going into planning mode. You know, sending the thief up to investigate with 10' pole and tying a rope around him so they can drag him back, deciding marching order and arraying themselves around the door, prepping spells, egad. Some heroes! Its a door. On occasion I'll play a brash axe-wielding Conan character and just kick the door in while the others are planning and preparing and charge into the next room. Its not the wisest of moves, but the character has a low wisdom.<br/><br/>Oh, and for character mistakes I think the hit men in Pulp Fiction are a fantastic example.

(Hi, David.)<br/><br/>I have noticed in recent <i>DitV</i> play that I tend to be the Planner--have often been the Planner, in gaming--and I try not to be a bully about it. Now, though, I find that I don't really want to have the duty/onus all of the time, but by then it can be tough to get others engaged in making Plans. (Aside: A great thing about <i>DitV</i> is that all this player-against-player conflict over plans can Go To Dice!)<br/><br/>This thread also reminds me of past play in <i>Aberrant</i>: Briefly, we were told it would be rollicking and rowdy, fights and chases, world-shaking events. After several sessions, it was clear that many other players (we had, like, eight or so) either didn't get the memo or disregarded it. The GM seemed to have forgotten (or was drifting to suit apparent preferences) and so a LOT of our play time would turn into Planning. Meanwhile, I'd built a combat monster (quite literally, if you know the Taint rules in <i>Aberrant</i>) and I didn't (a) feel like, in character, he'd be much of a Planner nor (b) want to spend an hour or more of each session on such (inevitably doomed-to-fail) Planning. And that's how my Catch Phrase was born, out of inspiration when asked (YET again) what I thought the group should do about the Problem of the Minute:<br/><br/>"I am a weapon. Aim me."<br/><br/>Don't know why I'm posting this, other than because I wanted to relate that cool line, and perhaps because it could be relevant to consider the AntiPlanner's agenda--be it personally chosen or implied in the game rules or setup/preamble. You've mentioned <i>Shadowrun</i> as a Plan-intensive game--based on its inspiration of caper fiction--and so maybe the root of the problem lies in the players' relative perceptions of what the game you are play is "about." For an extreme example, I'd cast a leery eye towards a Planner in <i>Toon</i>; and I would tend to kabosh a lot of Planning in stuff like D&amp;D and CoC--exploration is risky, monsters more so, so get into marching order and ready your kit and GO, dammit!<br/><br/>Hmmm... anyone else think that Instincts in <i>Burning Empires</i> are a form of Anti-Planning mechanic, in that they "cover the bases" for the most important elements of a character's competence or preparation?<br/><br/>Also, there's something to be said for a point I made in a different thread, talking about granularity of detail and switching modes between general narrative and turn-by-turn, foot-by-foot declarations. In that thread, I offered a technique for making the switch: let the players position themselves "for free" when things get crunchy, under the assumption that this is a party of professional adventurers and, as such, they just "automatically" are in advantageous positions to support and protect each other. I used the parallel of a team of Special Forces guys entering a bar (in peacetime): they just automatically scan for blind spots and position themselves with back to walls or clear view of doors (or of each other's back). In the same manner, those GMs among you who tire of the 10' pole test and other machination at every door could just tell them, "Look, if something Bad is on the other side, I'll let you array yourselves however and presume you've prepped whatever you want to use, so let's wait until THEN to do all this, if it's even necessary." Of course, you needn't assure them that the door ITSELF is okie-dokie... <img alt="&gt;:)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/naughty.png" title="&gt;:)"/><br/><br/>Then again, your players might like this stuff--or might heavily embrace the resource and risk management subgame that is D&amp;D--and they might think YOU'RE breaking the game for them, by allowing Instincts or presuming prep.<br/><br/>OK, ramble off....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125874/#Comment_125874" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T16:46:39+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  4:46PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Planning in my group is a function of the game and characters, really.
