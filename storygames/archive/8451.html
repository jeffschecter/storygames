Vader is the guy who plays in the same universe on odd tuesdays and is a pal who the GM called in to give the players something to push against because he feels he isn't throwing enough at them (or the guy who was fired up to run an Imperial even though teh rest of the group wanted to roll Rebel).  By the end, Vader's character finally gets to sit down with the group and switches off a ton of Keys to reform at the last moment, and then takes a boat-load of extended conflict damage for Luke to make it count.<br/><br/>That player also likely gets all kinds of drinks at the after-party.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187401/#Comment_187401" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T13:43:06+00:00" title="January 10, 2009  1:43PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vader can certainly be a protagonist in Solar System terms! I wouldn't play something like the Star Wars trilogy as party-based, anyway - it's superficially like that, but the party is actually incidental; all the characters have their own issues and are only connected through parallel interests. Perfectly reasonable to alternate between scenes from both sides of the war.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, my interpretation of the trilogy would make only Luke, Han, Vader and Obi-Wan (killed early) into player characters, as their choices drive the overall story. The rest are antagonists (the emperor, Jabba) ,support (Leia, the droids, Lando, etc.) and extras (everybody else, pretty much).

Try Secret-learning Scene. . . <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>Anyway, Eero, I can see that. I guess I was thinking that Vader style of plot-driving over the whole course of the story is mostly being the big scary spur to others' actions and threatening interests, which says "Storyguide antagonist" to me. And actually, in your framework I'd take out Obi-wan as a PC. he's totally there to catapult Luke into the spotlight.<br/><br/>I still stand by Lando as a protagonist, though, albeit a supporting one. He totally looks like a new player coming on the scene and becoming "part of the gang." And yeah, you for sure don't have to play party-based, but it works fine with a party structure. And anyway, as you say the protags in Star Wars form and disband their "party" freely as needed.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>P.S. Just curious: does "hekki" mean anything in Finnish?

I'm not acknowledging the prequels for present purposes. I said "the original trilogy" for a reason."<br/><br/>Now, in an alternate universe where Episodes I-III are actually <i>good</i> and Anakin Skywalker is actually, believably the same complex and powerful personality we see behind the breath mask, then <i>yes</i>: he IS a protagonist. . .for the first three episodes. Then he has his tragic fall and Luke is the protagonist. Darth Vader moves into the background, and becomes mainly a force--still complex and powerful-to menace Luke and friends and spur them to action.

Someone suggested Star Wars, since it was a universe we were all familiar with.<br/><br/>One of the players, though, used to love Star Wars with the passion of a thousand suns. The second trilogy just took that love out of him though, not spinning him over to hate, but simply removing all the love for Star Wars, like a surgeon extracting an appendix. So he feels nothing for Star Wars now but weariness. Certainly not enough to get back into SW, even if we were rightly determined to "awesome it up".<br/><br/>After talking to him about it, we realized that the same was true for the rest of us. I mean, at some point in my life, I might watch a remastered SW or Empire again (especially Empire!), but man, Lucas must be a Tibetan Buddhist Monk or something: He spent countless hours creating a fantastic, wonderful world for all to love, then spent an equal amount of time wiping that love away, like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_mandala" rel="nofollow"><b>Sand Mandala</b></a>.<br/><br/>So yeah, in my camp, "none" is gonna be my final answer as well.<br/><br/>(although unlike the other guy, I can put most of my ennui aside to enjoy a brief game for a bit... but it has to be really focused, or else it falls apart)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187718/#Comment_187718" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T08:20:03+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  8:20AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, that was my reaction to SW, too.

The movie is just one story, good or bad, while the rpg is limitless stories. I'm much more hampered with SW gaming by the simple fact that the extended setting gets rather lame when you start reading those travelogues about the geography and exports industry of individual planets. As if I care.<br/><br/>Taking this into consideration, I see Solar System as a pretty perfect vehicle for what I'd be interested in doing with Star Wars: I wouldn't have to research anything that one wouldn't pick up from the movies, I could make up some cool rules for how the Force works, and heroes would be so heroic.
