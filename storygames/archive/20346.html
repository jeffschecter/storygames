Under typical circumstances it makes total sense (I want to begin and end with the fiction.) I can agree fully with "usually don't speak your move's name." But sometimes it's really helpful to provide a hint of the mechanical structure.<br/><br/>Especially when teaching the game, It feels important to create some transparency about what I'm doing as a GM, and always occluding the moves I make clouds that transparency. I want to be accountable to the rules of the game, and it's hard for that accountability to exist if the other players aren't sure why I'm saying what I'm saying, or by what rule I've been empowered to say it.<br/><br/>As a player, I like sometimes seeing behind the curtain. Too much consciousness of the structure is toxic, but just a glimpse here and there makes it feel more real somehow.<br/><br/>So: anybody else out there occasionally speaking their moves' names? Why do you do it? Why should or shouldn't I be doing it? Why do I like hearing the moves' names spoken sometimes?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448340/#Comment_448340" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-04T11:24:47+00:00" title="September  4, 2015 11:24AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Go ahead and do it if it will aid in understanding, illustrate your intention or make the game more fun.

While all of the rules are in the book for a reason, they aren't nearly as rigid as you might be used to. <br/><br/>For example: If you came up for a really awesome name for your barbarian that isn't listed on the character sheet, go ahead and use it. You won't break anything.<br/><br/>The Principles are closer to the core of the game, but they can still be drifted or hacked.<br/><br/>Not speaking the name of your move helps you as the MC focus on the fiction (which, remember, is where the effect of the MC moves actually happens). Speaking the name is like hanging a lampshade on a trope, calling attention to it. And you do risk letting the concrete details of the fiction slip away from you.<br/><br/>But sometimes hanging a lampshade the effect you want. It's drift but it won't break the game because (as can be seen from all the hacks) the core of the game is pretty robust.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448347/#Comment_448347" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-04T15:08:00+00:00" title="September  4, 2015  3:08PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only time I really see value in speaking the name of a GM move is when teaching the game - and mostly, actually, when teaching someone to GM the game.

But my experience with gaming and relationships more broadly tells me that accountability is an enabler of trust. No one is worthy of trust 100% of the time. When I fall short of my principles as a GM, I find it valuable to be able to point to what I did and how I fell short. When my players know that I'm accountable to those rules, trust is easy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448360/#Comment_448360" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-04T19:41:59+00:00" title="September  4, 2015  7:41PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see a merit in it, as something to build trust in the game and system.

Not if I have my way, anyway.  In fiction-focused play, I much prefer to pretend that fictional forces are the causal agents for everything that happens within the fiction.  In that context, being reminded at any point that a real human at this game table is making this fiction go (whether via rules or principles or otherwise) is unwelcome.<br/><br/>Of course, if the players in such a game do <i>not</i> view causes they can't see (as is often the case in AW) as fiction-based, and instead view them as "GM making stuff up", then there's nothing to lose by revealing the gameplay hows and whys of the GM's actions.

In most PBTA games it makes sense in that it's supposed to push you away from "I attack" and "I Discern Realities" style play and put the fiction first, but in hacks with more evocative move names, this is difficult. <br/><br/>For example, Spirit of 77. The moves are perfectly named and evocative of actual lines of dialog that would fit the genre, to the point where players would have to go into verbal gymnastics to never actually say the name of the moves. Deliver a Beatdown (melee), Smoke His Ass (ranged), Keep Your Cool (avoid danger) and the like. It's odd because even if the players name their moves they're still staying within genre because the move names are so perfectly in genre.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>
