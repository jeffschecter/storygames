Here's what I thought is necessary:<br/><br/>1) What dice to roll and when (when the fiction demands), what the stats mean, what X's are.<br/>2) How to use X's.<br/>3) An example fight (with use of X's and escalation)<br/>4) Explanation of what happens when you get a deadly wound (who you can bargain with).<br/>5) Bargains, and why you should strive to bargain instead of fighting (coupled with an in-fiction explanation of how it really isn't very wise to kill to the carpenter, for example; make his life a living hell, instead). <br/><br/>Did I miss anything essential? Other than that, I'll print out a map of the Caribbean, explain what the different people do on the ship, and make a few lists ("Things found on the deck of The Dagger" etc.) in case the players aren't familiar with the genre.<br/><br/>And two other questions:<br/><br/>6) Have you kept any secrets at all? I mean, are all the cruel fortunes and the pirates' ambitions public? My prior experiences with PvP have all had some stuff in secret and I'm a bit shy about everything being out in the open - especially with folks I've possibly never played with.<br/><br/>7) Have you allowed bargains in the middle of a fight? I think it would be appropriate since in fiction the characters might be talking, but does it complicate matters mechanically?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331607/#Comment_331607" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T15:25:36+00:00" title="June 25, 2011  3:25PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't explain anything.

In Apocalypse World, the MC uses countdown clocks to organize prep. In Poison'd, the GM uses Urgency to put immediate pressure on the players. You can get the same effect in Apocalypse World by making an immediate countdown clock public, if you want, especially if you attach a custom move to it. But there's no reason for all countdown clocks to be public.<br/><br/>The games don't work the same way, and even though some of their pieces look similar, they serve different needs in the games' workings.

Especially the traitor element and the madness CF seemed a bit "wtf, why are these public, they could be so much fun if everyone didn't know about it" - or more likely, I just feared all the players are so trad-minded that they wouldn't like the game as much as I do.<br/><br/>So I'll probably just say "make characters" and let them have a look at the character sheet if they want to know what each stat does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331733/#Comment_331733" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T15:05:05+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  3:05PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2011 3:05PM by Wightbred.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an alternative view I haven't found Poison'd difficult to play at all.

I tested it yesterday with friends, me as GM and four players. On a Poison'd scale, the characters were awfully nice - one had committed patricide, but towards each other they weren't that awful. Luckily one of them was the Cook's Mate and had been a friend of poor Tom's, so I decreed that he wanted to deliver The Dagger to Cpn Rutherford.<br/><br/>Everyone of us was a bit on the slow side, me for being the first timer GM, the other players probably not that used to PvP. Nevertheless, the system did exactly what it needed to do. Rolling lots of dice, adding more with X's, escalating, making the escalation show in the fiction, it worked fantastically! The crew to crew battle between The Dagger and The Resolute was tremendous - it had just enough mechanical crunch to feel like a risky battle, but it was loose enough so that it flowed fast enough and didn't feel like a slow, tactical exercise (which I've had to suffer from time to time with some systems). The escalation system altogether is really fun, even to just watch. I was a little afraid the players would feel the escalation system a bit too formal, but it really added to the tension and excitement.<br/><br/>The character creation took about an hour and I felt insecure, so I just had to explain some of the rules - a mistake, since it was of little use. The character creation sheet and a little remark of "X's are really important in fights, go for X's!" should suffice.<br/><br/>Fun fact: just prior to the session, I wondered what would happen if a player challenged another player to a mano-a-mano in a crew-to-crew combat, and surprisingly, the traitor pirate decided to do just that to the captain. I felt appropriate that the captain had to use his X's to both fights - after all, if you're in a mass battle commanding a crew and in a desperate sword-to-sword battle with a traitor, you have limited resources. Looking back, a flashback might've been appropriate.<br/><br/>Anyway, I feel confident enough that I'll run this piece of awesome thrice at Ropecon. The system has it's own logic and the elements serve different functions which seem really clear when you see them in play; it's surprisingly easy to make judgement calls.<br/><br/>v                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/halski" title="halski"><img alt="halski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/halski">halski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333810/#Comment_333810" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T00:30:03+00:00" title="July 11, 2011 12:30AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bah, additional question!<br/><br/>What do you feel is the sweet spot for number of players?
