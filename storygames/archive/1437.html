                    My Tuesday gaming group loves mid-depth tactical video and board games (Memoir '44, Mario Super Strikers, etc) but we've never tried a pen-and-paper tactics game.  I've been wanting to try out Iron Heroes for a while, and they liked it when I suggested that we try it as a straight tactical game, say one or two battles a night.<br/><br/>I want to start with very low overhead:  pregen characters, attack and defense, movement and AoOs, and DC 15 stunts.  We'll run one battle with <i>only those rules</i> for week one, then add new rules and wrinkles each week in a new battle.  (The Memoir scenario book was the inspiration here, obviously.)  After a few sessions we'll roll new individual characters.<br/><br/>I plan on introducing Chris's <a href="http://bankuei.blogspot.com/2005/08/designing-feats-rules-in-action_31.html" rel="nofollow">metagame</a> <a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=13620273&amp;postID=112628788313004713" rel="nofollow">feats</a> when I think we're up to speed for them.  I also want to weld on a simple Fan Mail system (grab an XP marker from the bowl for your friend who did something cool, and in exchange I get two tokens to put in my mooks' or villain's pools) for the player side of the metagame.  My goal is to make this a lot like the first levels of a complicated video game, without the crappy voice acting.<br/><br/>Assume I've already copied down <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=838" rel="nofollow">the errata</a>, and I have Mastering IH and the Bestiary, but haven't done much research beyond that.  That's where I need advice.  Who's played IH?  What are your favorite house rules?  Where are the rough spots, and what are the major bunk choices?  Are they worth trying to fix or best avoided entirely (I'm thinking here of the Arcanist)?  Is the incremental-rules approach worth trying?                </div>

                            1.  <a href="http://www.iron-league.com/displaycontent.cfm?iCatId=3&amp;iConID=20" rel="nofollow">Use the GOOD character sheets.</a><br/><br/>2.  I made cheat sheets, I use them every time I play:<br/><a href="http://rpgtalk.net/bankuei/files/16/13/Action%20Sheet%203.pdf" rel="nofollow">Action Sheet</a><br/><a href="http://rpgtalk.net/bankuei/files/16/14/IH%20Stunt%20&amp;%20Challenge%20Sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">Stunt &amp; Challenge Sheet</a><br/><br/>3.  If you start people with just Attack &amp; Defense challenges, you should still have some good times.  Defense challenges have a wonky thing where you take the penalty, but only get the bonus -next- round, which I think everyone ditches in favor of "penalty now, bonus now".<br/><br/>4.  From Mastering Iron Heroes, use Action Zones.  Tell the players what the zones do at the beginning of the encounter- don't make them guess it.  (It's a piece of advice I saw in a Mearls' interview, that somehow didn't make it into the book!).  The Villian classes seem underpowered for their CRs, and like-wise, the minions suffer because of their extremely sad feat options.  I stuck with mostly monsters and a couple of PC classes.<br/><br/>5.  The Berserker is a very, very powerful class.  At low levels, the Berserker can overshadow a lot of other characters.  The biggest breaker is the ability that lets them shunt Reserve points to Hitpoints as a free action.  Generally, the character classes seem to find better balance around level 5+, so you might want to start at level 3 or 4 so that PCs aren't too far apart in effectiveness.<br/><br/>6.  Iron Heroes Characters are about 2 EL's higher than normal D&amp;D characters.<br/><br/>7.  Now with even more play experience, I wouldn't bother with the "Reinforcements" feat idea I made without serious overhaul- mooks just get creamed way too fast and way too easily in play.<br/><br/>8.  Major bunk choices include a fair portion of the Traits section, and a couple of the Feat trees, like Trident Mastery, or Foehammer.  Everything beyond the first mastery of Beast Lore is also not so good.                        </div>

                            There's some minor adjustments to the feat trees and traits which can make them non-bunk.  For instance, basing attack special effect saving throws on damage done rather than lvl + attribute makes a good deal of sense, to me.<br/><br/>If I live in Oakland next year, Chris, you want to do a serious revision?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            Sure man.  IH sits right at the edge of effort for me.  I love it enough I -want- to do the effort of fixing the rough edges, but I'd need to be playing tons of it to justify the time.                        </div>

                            Yeah.  I think that just a few tweaks could fix Foe Hammer, Trident Master, Beast Mastery, and so on.  Those are the things I'm driven to fix.  Things like the Armiger, which seems complicatedly broken, I'm less driven for.<br/><br/>I also just statted out that awesome double-ended dagger that the executioner uses.  It's an exotic weapon that gives you +2 to hit targets that are flanking you (or targets that would be flanking you, even).<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            And here's my fix for Beast Lore:<br/><br/>Mastery 1 changes: Spend a token to give all allies +1 to hit <i>or</i> +1 to damage against the target.  If you do not encounter a target for this feat for an entire level, gain (100 x level) (number of Beast Lore Masteries x 10 x level) bonus XP when you level up.  This does not count if Beast Lore is granted by an item or by the Man-at-Arms wild card feat ability.<br/><br/>All other Masteries: Give the bonus to all of your allies.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben<br/><br/>P.S.  The bonus XP is basically a way to make it so that, even if the GM decides to not throw animals your way, you're benefitting from the feat.                        </div>

                            Chris, thanks for the links (especially the <a href="http://www.iron-league.com" rel="nofollow">Iron League</a> and thereby the <a href="http://ironheroeshouserules.pbwiki.com/" rel="nofollow">House Rules wiki</a>).  I think I'm going to try the <a href="http://ironheroeshouserules.pbwiki.com/Compiled%20Armiger" rel="nofollow">Compiled Armiger</a> and Hong's <a href="http://www.zipworld.com.au/~hong/ih/wmaster.htm" rel="nofollow">Tokenless Weapon Master</a> and see how those work, since they seem to be the most maligned.<br/><br/>Ben, if you decide to tweak any of the feat trees, I'd love to see them here--same for that double dagger.  I'm going to make one of the 3rd-level pregens an Executioner and that'd be a neat primary weapon.  (The others will be the aforementioned Armiger and Weapon Master, an Archer, a Harrier and a Berserker; the players will pick five of those.)                        </div>
