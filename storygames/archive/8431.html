Exploring why people enjoy this play, I keep seeing this as a positive thing: the game is loose enough that anything you can think of to do, the GM can quickly make a call on and move on.<br/><br/>I'm more convinced over time that for a certain style of play, GM determination is powerful mojo. However, I've seen a lot of negativity towards "GM fiat" as unfair and unfun.<br/><br/>So, what's the deal?

Really, in most games it happens at some level anyway, so making it explicit and focused isn't an inherently problematic issue for me. And hell, there is something really fun in that old school mode of the having the players wow you so much that you just have them win. <br/><br/>But there are also a lot of times, especially when playing in more difficult games with more subtle themes, where I don't want to have the buck stop at me. When the group as a whole is trying to work around a tough theme, I don't want to have final say because it makes it too easy for the game to become about my theme alone. Or when there is a particularly difficult call with lots of status and enjoyment on the line it can be cumbersome and socially awkward to always have to be the one who makes the final call. <br/><br/>There are times where always having to be The Decider is just annoying. Where it exhausts my creativity and makes me feel on the spot all the time. In those times I like a game that has some way of avoiding that. <br/><br/>So really, my answer is going to be contextual and contingent. (Damn me and my relativism!) There is nothing wrong with GM determination in general, I'm just glad that I have games where I don't have to do it all the time. <br/><br/>I think what I like most is games with telescoping and collapsing parts, really. So that in the same game with the same mechanical system I can sometimes make the call and sometimes not. Those games are cool.<br/><br/>As a player... actually, as a player my answer is much the same. Different reasons, sure, but still the same outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186324/#Comment_186324" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T13:23:23+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  1:23PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely usable and important, I've been researching this issue myself recently. My preliminary conclusion is that the problem is in game texts focusing too much on rules over <i>method</i> - the text tells you that the GM makes the call, but it does not really enforce the notion that the GM has a method and purpose in how and why he makes that call. At best you have a GMing chapter as some sort of cryptological secret, sacred text the GM is supposed to learn outside game time and then apply, but at least I have great difficult getting anything out of your average, self-contradictory, vague GM text. It's like trying to use the Bible to make calls on how other people should... well, yeah, that's that analogue.<br/><br/>This is also why Internet discussions of these GM calls are not usually very useful. One person tells you how the game sucks because his GM made a bad call, then another guy says that he'd never make that call in this game because obviously you're supposed to GM it this other way... and they're both right. The game sucks if you GM it badly, and rules if you don't, and it's not really something you can pin on the game unless you start demanding that games actually have real GM methodology to offer, the kind where you can really point to the text and say that a given GM is playing against the instructions.<br/><br/>The real answer to this issue, I feel, is to confess that almost all old GM texts are bad, bad texts that often do more to hinder than help running a real coherent game. Game writers have tried to cater to all imaginable styles of play with vague rules and even more vague GMing instructions (including instructions on how to use those rules), which has proliferated into a game culture that doesn't believe in texts in the first place, and with good reason. The only way to redeem the powerful GM (or any kind of open-ended player decision-making, really) is to accept that it's not enough to just say that the GM "makes a determination". You also have to say why and how he makes it. Something like having the GM decide whether monsters appear or you character manages to climb that cliff, to pick a couple of examples, are utterly unproblematic situations if the whole group is crystal clear on why and how the GM is making those choices.<br/><br/>So yes, method - explore that more, and learn to write about it. I might define method as "rules you apply in your head to your own decisions only". I imagine that it's easy to see how having robust method obviously makes a powerful GM unproblematic. And how a GM who's just running randomly from moment to moment, prone to reacting adversely to what others do, might be a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186325/#Comment_186325" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T13:23:36+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  1:23PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I'm not thread jacking/crapping, why can't one read "GM determines" and replace it with "the group's consensus determines," and take advantage of every else's expertise with the system and setting/canon or play style preference? I think that's where "GM fiat" becomes pejorative: he or she ignores others' play preferences or experience in favor of his or her own (often rigid, sometimes downright mean or competitive) proclivities, especially in violation of established play styles, norms, or canon. Only if the GM really is the One True Expert is "determination" not "fiat," and those cases will be few and far between (e.g. GM-created setting). More often, fiat is the engine that runs the railroad....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186326/#Comment_186326" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T13:24:54+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  1:24PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clinton, I think it's because, in indie games, we've made great advances by taking away the GM's power.

Are you arguing that there's nothing wrong with the omnipotent GM thing where, you know, the GM can decide whatever? (Even if it's "for the good of the game" or whatever.)<br/><br/>What if when a D&amp;D reaches 0 hit points, the DM decides if the character lives or dies. Now the game has shifted from mastering an arcane set of character-building and tactical rules towards mastering how to manipulate your friend to get him to keep your character alive. Or maybe he hates it when your characters die, so he always lets them live. Now there are no consequences for your decisions, so why bother making them? Maybe the DM doesn't want life or death power over characters, because he has few means to decide this fairly and because he doesn't want his friends to be mad at him.<br/><br/>Okay, so this is an absurd argument, but things like that happen. Fiat decisions are cool when they don't matter a lot. There aren't a lot of RPGs that don't hand one person a whole lot of deciding power over the fates of characters at some point during play. The trick is not letting this force make other people's choices meaningless. That's deprotagonizing, pretty much textbook. If you're gonna write rules that give players choices to make, don't make those choices meaningless by letting one person make an arbitrary (unpredictable) decision that invalidates them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186330/#Comment_186330" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T13:31:05+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  1:31PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To clarify the above in a punchy manner: if your game says that the GM decides how a NPC reacts to a player's roleplaying, say, then why not also continue that sentence by explaining what the GM bases that decision on? Words don't cost that much. My belief is that primitive roleplaying texts we might explore to find these "GM decides" rules don't tell you the reasons for that decision either because the designer had such a narrow perspective that he never realized one might get confused about this, or because he was explicitly trying to avoid this thorny and difficult issue on which he simply didn't have design tools. There were plenty of "great GMs" running around in the halcyon days, but they were all running different games and with different methods, so it would have taken more bravery than designers had to be explicit about the why and how of GM decision-making.<br/><br/><i>Solar System</i> has many places where there is GM decision-making in the game. One of the things I did in my rewrite of the game was to make an explicit list of the points in the game where the GM will need to make decisions, and also why and how those decisions should be made. I also did the same for players. There simply aren't any decisions in the Solar System for which I don't provide a method for making that decision - a player may, if he wants, read the text carefully and make all decisions in the game based on the designer-intended method. Or if there are some spots where I failed to provide method (and I have a vague memory of being stumped about some point of GMing duties in there somewhere), then I say that it's a too difficult topic to deal with now, and has to be left for individuals to solve or hash out in the forums.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186334/#Comment_186334" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T13:37:58+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  1:37PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David: there is a simple and valid reason for having the GM decide some things, and it's basically the same reason you have for having a player decide on some things. That reason is that the game will have more unexpected, powerful input by not running everything through the consensus-making procedure. If we want a game to be genuine interaction at all instead of just being the result of such interaction in the form of a concensus process, we have to accept that some players are going to make some decisions without taking input from others. If you expect everybody to have a say in everything all the time, then that process is your game and any dice rolling or whatnot will just be an afterthought.<br/><br/>This is a familiar point to me because that's what my brother, an avid D&amp;D gamer, tries to do with D&amp;D as a sort of bastardization of Forgean game design principles. I think he's backed out on the worst of it, but at one point his adventures were vague affairs where he'd engage the players into a discussion of whether they'd like to have wolves attack the party, or whether they'd rather skip this essentially meaningless random encounter and head straight for the next plot point. I can assure you that increasing the amount of consensus decisions at the expense of the GM doing his job did not improve the overall game experience, as those authoritative backstory/setting-calls made by the GM are essential to not having the players get confused and start fighting over storymaking power. After all, why concentrate on having your character face the challenge of the hungry wolves when you can just face the challenge of voting the challenge down even before it's introduced into the game...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186338/#Comment_186338" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T13:46:06+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  1:46PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I agree with Graham in principle, but at the same time I've had many opportunities to observe behavior in GM-less play, and I think that determination doesn't really go away.  It just floats up to join the jockeying at the social contract level.  There are a million ways that things get resolved, or dismissed, or obviated, or whatever that you can see in the interplay of dudes at the table, and this happens even with a GM, but moves in to fill that void when the position is vacant.

I also think that understanding of game texts as teaching texts is woefully neglected. <br/><br/>I mean, neither of those things is easy to do. Understanding process is difficult, both for the person trying to convey and the one being conveyed to. I think a lot of "indie" games mechanize their process so heavily because in crystallizing it into formal game procedures they hope to side-step the necessity of conveying a lot of the underlying structure. Worth noting, they often aren't successful. Many Indie games work, at some level, because folks understand the process from other Indie games and a culture of play shared through Cons and online talk and the like. Folks who don't understand the still necessary but unmechanized processes often have trouble getting satisfactory play. <br/><br/>The other difficulty is that process at the level you're talking about is often heavily socially contingent. A process that works for one group and set of social and aesthetic considerations may well not work for another group, and unlike where mechanical processes go wrong it can be very difficult to figure out where the disconnect is. Thus when the process fails, it tends to result in cascading failure that can be difficult to fix. <br/><br/>So when I read this thread and look over at Tony's "better" thread and Jonathan's "structured freeform" thread, it makes me think that we're starting to look at designing to that level. That is, that we're starting to look for ways to design games such that they enable at the social process level, rather than at the mechanical interaction level. Historically I think there have been some strands of design that have tried to use mechanical interaction to replace social procedure, with mixed results, and that questions like the one Clinton is asking are because we're starting to look beyond that. <br/><br/>(Edit: The Morningstar brings up a similar point. Just because the GM isn't doing the process, doesn't mean someone isn't. The mechanics may help, but in the end the social procedure still has to be processed.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_186347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186347/#Comment_186347" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T13:59:28+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  1:59PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2009 2:02PM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton</cite>I'm more convinced over time that for a certain style of play, GM determination is powerful mojo.

Absolutely!<br/><br/>GM fiat may be both unfair and unjust, but at the same time it can be a motor in the game. It can be the element that lifts a game from dull task-resolution to tense character-conflict. It is not the only way to do this, but it is certainly one way of supporting good game-play.<br/><br/>The GM has been abandoned in many modern games, and many of them are better games for it, but still this "authority-invested player" has certain strengths that may be utilized for fun and excitement. It is a task heavily dependent on the flexibility of a human brain, the ability to "read" a situation and to improvise ever tighter drama from it. Some people have this ability, and even more can learn it. When skilled GMs are at work at the table, games turn into gold.<br/><br/>Let's not abolish it! Let the GM live on alongside the new and modern stuff. The GM may not be modern, but it is still an element of great potential in classical games!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186351/#Comment_186351" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T14:06:47+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  2:06PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there room for it?

So, when I'm GMing, if something comes up that I have no rules to cover, I'll make something up, but I'll do two things that trad texts don't emphasize sufficiently:<br/><br/>1) <i>Keep the player(s) involved</i> (at least in making a roll).  "OK, well, make an Elvish check, difficulty 3."<br/><br/>2. <i>Have a consequence in mind</i>.  Failure and success on the roll need to look different.  (This is something the GMing chapter of <i>Spirit of the Century</i> nails; that chapter in general is an amazingly beautiful bit of writing about gaming at the process level for GMs.)  Sometimes I'll even say ahead of time what the consequence of failure will be, so that the players can know if it's worth it to expend resources like Drama points on the roll.<br/><br/>Bad fiat GMing is also not about situational authority, which does rightly belong to the GM in most GM'd games (even in indie games with a GM, it mostly belongs to the GM even if the players have some of it)\u2014you're damn right the GM gets to say when wolves attack the party!  IME, bad fiat GMing is about arbitrarily ignoring the rules, usually because one of the players (aka me) knows them better.  I'm not talking about house-ruling, which can be OK when given sufficient warning, I'm talking about flat-out ignoring the results of a die roll (aka "fudging").

We all know the bad-GM horror stories, but really a big part of being a good GM is making sure the social interaction works:  the shy player gets some spotlight, the deliberate thinker get the time they need to process, the domineering Alpha personality is kept in check, and so on.<br/><br/>An interesting chicken or the egg question for me is whether critical thinking about game play and design leads to socially responsible players or whether socially responsible players are naturally more inclined to think critically about game play and design.  Either way, I think the broader indie community has a pretty high ratio of socially responsible players who don't need a GM as social traffic cop / babysitter.  That lack of need means, I think, that a GM is less important and that we are (as a broad generalization) pretty well able to handle the social dynamics of GM-less play.  I think that makes this community more inclined to see GM-less play as easily doable / preferable.<br/><br/>I think it also means that seeing less value in some of the very important good things a GM can bring, we tend to focus more on the bad things a GM can bring, thus inculcating a negative bias.<br/><br/>Combine this with one of the core (and I mean REALLY core / fundamental) realizations to come out of the indie design community over the last several years -- that the duties of the GM can be broken up and distributed and are not required to all be vested in a single person -- and I think we've created an environment where the default position is (at best) GM's are not necessary; or even "bad".<br/><br/>I think there's plenty of room for indie designers to turn our attention to the oft maligned GM and see what interesting tricks we can make it do.

What has really struck me as we have played different games and as we have swapped GMing different games is that GMed games tend towards one sort of play experience and GMless games tend towards another.  It's been said a thousand times, but there really is some truth to the distinction of "playing in the GM's story" and "collaborating on a story together."<br/><br/>When I GM, he looks to me to feed him story crumbs, constantly seeks my rubber-stamp approval for what he's doing, and in all respects keeps trying to align what he's doing with what I'm doing.  More than once I have reminded the players that they get to author as much as I do, and (when we're playing Dogs, frex) whatever they do will work as long as they have the dice to back it up.  No need to pixel-bitch or find the "right" plan and then execute it.  I like to think that the players are doing a lot more piloting of the story progression (even if they don't realize it at the time), and I'm just throwing in opposition and adversity, a far more reduced role than "trad" GMing, and one I prefer.<br/><br/>When he GMs a more traditional game, I have to repeatedly check my more enthusiastic flights of creativity and make sure that I'm not straying too far from what he has planned.  I am often at a loss mid-game as to how to participate, because the things that I naturally want to do (frame a scene, get into a PvP conflict, somehow get some mechanical reward for keying into the game's theme) simply aren't there and/or have no rules support to allow me to do them.  Now, I am working hard to come to appreciate and enjoy the game experience that he has on offer, but as I have developed that part of my gaming palate, I keep finding ways that "his" game is a totally different thing than "my" game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186384/#Comment_186384" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T16:05:01+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  4:05PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, conclusion.

Something like that, anyway.  I tend to agree, and I do NOT want to be the mechanic here (as a long-time GM).  I want that to be mechanics we all agreed on.  I've written about this before, in connection with me GMing "freeform" games (or pure GM fiat games, in that context).  I hated, hated, hated having to decide what the consequences of the players' actions were.  I wanted to be able to tell them ahead of time: "If you do this, there's an 80% chance your leg gets blown off", and then we roll the dice.  Without that, once they did something, even if I warned "This might blow your leg off,"  I still felt really, really hesitant to then enforce this kind of consequence.<br/><br/>So there you go.

Sure I have played in games where the GM was making decisions based upon assessments I completely disagreed about.  It happens regularly in my D&amp;D game where my view of how society works is different to that of the GM's and I remember playing in a screwy Amber game which was full of it.  But then in that same Amber game, I remember regularly thinking "that's not in keeping with what was in the books".<br/><br/>In cases of GM fiat as in authorial fiat you're either going to be happy with the calls, in which case you're unlikely to notice the problem, or you disagree with the calls in which case you either complain or you change your perceptions and assumptions to suit those of the fiat-based system.<br/><br/>As said elsewhere, I think in all of these cases, groups tend to be complicit and so they tend to regulate.  In games where GMs take the piss, the group tends to complain and in in groups where the rules suck then the group complains and you get into "shall we just ignore that bit?" territory.<br/><br/>I have no problem at all with GM fiat either as a player or as a GM.  In fact, I think a willingness and a capacity to make on-the-spot rulings about stuff is what makes a good GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186489/#Comment_186489" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T06:58:15+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  6:58AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, as I said, for me there was a very tangible, very practical difference.  Here's the situation from our session.  Three characters in ancient Egypt are hiding in a temple from a plague of locusts summoned by priests of Seth.  They hear screams outside--an old priest hasn't made it to safety and is being eaten by locusts.  Now they can decide to charge out and try to save the guy, risking their own hides, or they can stay inside figuring it's too late already.  They all three run outside.  Now it's up to me, the GM, to tell them what the consequence is.  My mind thinks the following:<br/><br/>1. On what basis do I decide to hurt their characters and how badly?  Is it based on their descriptions of their actions?  On simulating what would really happen?  On dramatic story flow?  Do I even have enough information to make this decision?  Is my information the same as the players', to the degree that they'd agree with the assessment?<br/><br/>2. Do I hurt all three equally, even though that's unrealistic and could break suspension of disbelief?  Does it matter that one of the players is my wife?  How would the other two feel if their characters got hurt but hers didn't, even if I say it's based on my assessment, not our relationship?  Since this is an online game where I haven't met the other two players face-to-face, will they understand my reasoning?  (And no, I don't want to discuss either working these things out through lengthy dialogue, again and again, or changing my medium of play or my players involved--I want to discuss this specific situation at this specific time.)<br/><br/>3. Do I have to explain myself and my decision?  What if a pattern evolves over time that looks like preference even if I didn't intend it to?<br/><br/>4. What if they weren't aware of the actual risk involved?  Telling them, "There's a good chance you may get hurt," is much more vague than telling them, "I'm going to roll a D10; the higher the worse; up to getting your leg gnawed off."<br/><br/>5. Whose responsibility is it if the leg of a character gets gnawed off?  If they go for it based on GM fiat, the decision is up to me.  I have to make it, and I have to justify it, to myself and to them.  If I have a die and I tell them BEFOREHAND what the exact risk is and thereby imbue the dice with that power, the decision and responsibility is now theirs.  This is a very important difference for me, especially when playing with people who are not my closest friends and whom I can't discuss everything with before and after the game due to constraints (con games, online games, etc.).<br/><br/>Negotiation only helps this if we were both on the same footing: see IAWA.  If I as the GM have to negotiate every outcome, it's not only tedious and time-consuming, it's putting me and my decisions on the spot all the time.<br/><br/>Now, outcome-setting could work if you mean that we agree beforehand what the result would be.  But then, that would require lots of back-and-forth negotiation about the situation and the consequences.  And I'd just like to have a quick and smooth way of saying, "This is your risk, take it or leave it."<br/><br/>This is not some hypothetical I'm making up to make an argument.  I'm just sharing exactly how I felt about this issue in a real play situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186501/#Comment_186501" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T07:34:06+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  7:34AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>You know, come to think of it, biased and influencable human judgement is<i><b>why</b></i>I play RPGs.</blockquote>\nYES!<br/><br/>The point was made further up thread that games like Chess and Poker don't have these subjective and uncodified procedures where someone has to make something up. That's because they are really really simple games, simple enough in fact that computers can, and do, beat us at them with regularity. (They only seem hard due to the incredibly poor nature of human working memory).<br/><br/>RPGs in contrast are hard, very very hard. They simulate things more complex than any plausible rule-system can comfortably handle, they demand human judgement to work, indeed I often tell people that RPGs are pretty much the biggest mental workout that one can have as a hobby.

Think of it as laying ground work for later play.<br/><br/>It can also lay groundwork for helping other players who typically don't take on the GM position become more comfortable with the idea. This aids in avoiding GM burnout.<br/><br/>Besides, even Divine Right Monarchs had advisors and had to take account in their rulings of factors outside of their own wishes.<br/><br/>(Well, they didn't absolutely have to take account of them, but those monarchs tended to come to bad ends.

I do love me collaborative games, and yeah, I think you get a lot of very useful buy-in when you bring all the players together creatively pre-play. But a single-player creation is a whole 'nother critter. It's going to be quirky. It's going to be highly personal. The players will, on occasion, grind up against those quirks and they won't like it. But that's just another way of introducing unexpected new material into the game fiction. It's the same reason a good game mechanic works the way it does: sometimes you don't get the answer you wanted or expected, and now the challenge is to work around the new information.<br/><br/>The weak link in a strong-GM game is that it's probably the most trust-relevant way to play. If you won't/can't trust the GM to remain true to his own vision, it's the wrong style. If the GM lacks credibility, it won't work. If the system provides unambiguous mechanics and procedures and the GM bypasses them for reasons other than to serve his vision (i.e. to be a dick), it won't work. So many ways to do it wrong.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186512/#Comment_186512" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T08:24:20+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  8:24AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite><b>If the system provides unambiguous mechanics and procedures </b>and the GM bypasses them for reasons other than to serve his vision (i.e. to be a dick), it won't work.</blockquote>\nClearly, my answer is to dispense with unambiguous mechanics and procedures.<br/><br/>Or, alternatively, simply declare that they are tools for the GM, and not the character players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186514/#Comment_186514" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T08:31:28+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  8:31AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 8:33AM by Ludanto.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Ludanto: Doesn't that simply make "Fiat"= "Judgement calls we don't like"?</blockquote>\nYeah, in practice I suppose it is, but that's pretty subjective.

We decide what form conflict will take and how characters react to the outcomes of conflicts. We decide that time passes rapidly or that we focus down on moments heartbeat by heartbeat. We decide that a scene has ended or a location shifted. We decide a villain hates that character but doesn\u2019t give a fig about another character. We create earthquakes, rampaging hordes and giant radioactive monsters from nothing. We decide the building where your character is sleeping is burning, and you better roll something or spend some resource to escape if you don\u2019t want to get burned.<br/><br/>Some rulesets may address some of the issues above. But there are always some decisions to be made that lie outside the scope of the rules. These decisions that lie outside the scope of the rules are integral and essential to role-playing games. We are not robots. And I daresay that few of us would enjoy a game in which our only role would be to fulfill the script dictated by the rules.<br/><br/>Some of the decisions that lie outside the scope of the rules make up the fruitful void of a game. The rules provide limitations and creative constraints that give those decisions additional weight.<br/><br/>So yes, I think there's absolutely a place for GM/Antagonist player determination in modern games. It's simply a question of which decisions to leave to player determination and which should be determined by the rules of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186527/#Comment_186527" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T08:51:02+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  8:51AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 8:51AM by komradebob.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>Personally, if I'm forced to play in a game like that, I go in with the full acceptance that the rules are meaningless and that I have to trust the GM.

Once they let go of that, it makes things a bit easier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186541/#Comment_186541" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T09:16:27+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  9:16AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>The dysfunction comes from players trying to rely on rules that aren't reliable.

I like the idea suggested previously that in theory it's "judgement without sufficient guidelines on how to make it".  Subjective, but less so maybe.<br/><br/>I like that answer better, but there is a still a big gulf in the notion of "sufficient". Yes, a game should give some sort of notion of the style of decisions that are in keeping with it's mechanical feel, or spirit, but beyond that is it necessary to give guidelines for each specific area of judgement (like the example from the Star Wars thread of when a character is sufficiently distracted to trigger an attack of opportunity)? I suspect not, since that becomes pretty much like yet more rules, and jumping to quick judgements that resolve complex situations is what human brains are good at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186581/#Comment_186581" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T10:42:39+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 10:42AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>So you never attempt to negotiate or ask for more info about a situation in attempt to suss out outcomes the GM has in mind?<br/><br/>Sorry.

The other conclusion was that an activity is likely to be dissatisfying for a person interested in the other type of experience. However, I don't think there's much awareness of that among gamers. There's this enormous bag full of products, each providing only one of the two general types of activity, and people tend to grab whatever they reach, hoping it gives them the experience they want. It's hit or miss, and for those looking for an actual game experience, usually miss.<br/><br/>I see a need for more transparency of tabletop products in this regard. However, most people out there are already accustomed to thinking about this sort of performancec as games. Which produces a lot of confusion, I'd say.<br/><br/>Well, early RPGs <i>were </i>more game-like.<br/><br/>And even the activity of "outwit the GM" or "Outwit the scenario" is a competitive game, even if you never use any "physics engine" type mechanics. Or, really, any particular mechanics at all beyond description and judgment calls.<br/><br/>Or, maybe it's <i>play</i>, as in War-Play (kriegspiel), which it resembles.<br/><br/>More confusing, calling an interactive activity engaged in for fun a "game" isn't <i>entirely</i> wrong, especially if there doesn't exist a word or term that is a better fit. (No doubt the origin of the term "Role Playing Game"- a combination term to name something that didn't have a pre-existing term for it).<br/><br/>And even with all that, even as a performance, if we call it that, it's a kind of performance with heavy interaction between participants, which makes it rather different from most types of performance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186701/#Comment_186701" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T16:59:10+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  4:59PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 5:00PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jedibunny</cite>We had a discussion about it on a Polish forum recently, and the general conclusion was most of games that are generally recognized as "role-playing games" are essentially performance activities of that sort, as opposed to some non-traditional designs that produce an actual game experience.</blockquote>\nThis makes a lot of sense for me.

Exploring why people enjoy this play, I keep seeing this as a positive thing: the game is loose enough that anything you can think of to do, the GM can quickly make a call on and move on.<br/><br/>I'm more convinced over time that for a certain style of play, GM determination is powerful mojo. However, I've seen a lot of negativity towards "GM fiat" as unfair and unfun.<br/><br/>So, what's the deal? Is there a good place for this is a modern game?</blockquote>\nI've played OD&amp;D for over five years straight now and am sympathetic to your confusion.  It sounds like you are placing GM fiat in opposition to the GM following the game rules.  The GM doesn't have to follow any games rules at all, do they?  Those are only for the role players.  I don't know what game texts you are reading, but in my understanding the GM is always the final arbiter of what happens in any RPG.  <br/><br/>The GM fiat part most old schoolers I know object to is the GM just making up whatever he (or she) wants.  They have to stay true to the roles that have been agreed upon prior to play.  The GM's the expert helping the players learn their roles.  If the GM starts putting the players in roles they did not agree to play or doesn't even know the ins and outs of the roles himself, then the whole activity is just a pack of lies.  There has to be an earnest attempt at role veracity by the GM or what happens isn't really role playing at all, is it? <br/><br/>Think of it this way.  All role playing is teaching and learning.  The trust you need to have in your GM is as vital as the trust required by any kind of teacher.  (And the corresponding responsibility to the students / role players is as great as that trust, if not more so.)  This might not seem as important when the roles are fictional versus real world ones, but fictional role playing won't work either without GM-known roles.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H</cite>I'd prefer a GM not be my friend if they're to be the sole impartial judge.<br/>I have a problem with GM as antagonist and GM as friend.<br/>I'm not a fan of one person filling the cracks between the rules, and also being the antagonist.<br/>If in football, the referees were also on the challenging team, I'd have a problem with that too.</blockquote>\nThe instructor in charge of role playing is always the antagonist in a way.  He or she is that outside world that defines the limits of your role, so in that way any GM in an RPG is also an antagonist.  I think what you're referring to is when a GM or instructor stops running a role playing exercise and starts tormenting players for what ever reason.  <br/><br/>Think about who the referee is in football role playing a.k.a. scrimmage.  It's the coach, right?  They are the one running the exercise and telling the players when they do well and when they screw up.  If he started telling the opposing team of role players to play a certain way in order to put the other team into a specific situation, then he has something valid in mind, right?  He's not just thinking, "let's smash Henry with all three linebackers because he came late to practice."  That's a dereliction of his duty to teaching football.  If anything, he's teaching something else.  And it might just be: the coach is a total jerk and not to be trusted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187415/#Comment_187415" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T14:33:20+00:00" title="January 10, 2009  2:33PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: howandwhy99</cite>I don't know what game texts you are reading, but in my understanding the GM is always the final arbiter of what happens in any RPG.</blockquote>\nI think you might find that many of the independent games talked about here don't fit that mold <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187454/#Comment_187454" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T16:35:52+00:00" title="January 10, 2009  4:35PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: howandwhy99</cite>The GM doesn't have to follow any games rules at all, do they?

That's almost always the GM.  If you want that to be the rules first and then the GM, that's cool too. But the final reality of the roles has to be coming from somewhere external to the players, right?  So GM and/or rules unless the group is explicitly playing a storytelling game.  I'm not trying to cause waves here as I know this is a site about storygaming.

Can you suggest a book on role playing or somewhere online with the information?  I wrote what you quoted above as that's how roles work in real life.  I don't get to say what it means to be a librarian or a police officer, all of society does.  A person in those roles is limited to what reality and society will allow.  There's an external accountability.  <br/><br/>For fictional RPGs, think if a player showed up ready to play a 1940's detective game and then began to play the role of a space explorer in the year 2200?  They're doing it wrong.  Same as if the GM promised to run the same and then presented the sci-fi game.  In any kind of role playing we rely on the person directing the role playing to get it right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187537/#Comment_187537" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-11T07:02:43+00:00" title="January 11, 2009  7:02AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey David,<br/><br/>Let's give each other the benefit of the doubt here.

I honestly would like any suggestions for books to read on role playing.  I understand this is a storygaming site and it revolves around certain philosophies.  I'm not here to deny anyone's self identity or start a disagreement.\n<blockquote>I personally, for example, come from a social science background.

For the scrimmage example from another thread, role playing football means all the players are in charge of each other for staying within their roles.  But the definition of the role is the final say.  Not that anyone is forced to play their role when playing football, but it helps.  The rules of football have lead to defined roles just as the rules of life place certain real world expectations on all of us.  Heck, even the coach could be wrong, perhaps misremembering the rules, and someone else could point out their mistake.  You would really want to know what you are talking about though, otherwise we'd all end up sitting around arguing how much damage a katana should do.<br/><br/>It's odd, but a football scrimmage could be considered an RPG too, if the rewards for the players' performances were formalized.  But that would be a real world RPG versus a fictional one in my mind.\n<blockquote>So, I see several options: you can have a strong GM by agreement of the players; you can have players that self-regulate or regulate each other (this works, frex, in freeform gaming I've experienced); you can distribute or rotate GM functions; and probably more.</blockquote>As long as the rules are known to everyone, but then you have the problem in fictional RPGs of perfect knowledge.  In game terms, perfect knowledge assumes we know everything about the situation of the game.  Nothing is hidden.  That's important if you're going to GM, but it isn't exactly fun if you want to immerse yourself in the role.  It's hard to discover what you already know.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>One thing to remember, too, is that some people construe "roleplaying" to mean quite literally "playing a role".

It's a group of exercises that was formed as a social science methodology to study how people play roles in society.

And I'm here to act civilly and hopefully learn a few things too.  <br/><br/>I think the main point of disagreement between both myself along with most non-storygamers versus many of the new "Big Model" gamers is the definition of role play used.  I use the one found here: <a href="http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/roleplaying?view=uk" rel="nofollow">(link)</a> versus the one used by The Forge.  From what I can understand, the Forge definition is taken from Drama Therapy rather than the original used by Moreno for Psychodrama, Sociodrama, and role training.  This is ironic as Drama Therapy didn't even exist until after D&amp;D and other fictional role playing games had been created.  If we really were interested in creator intent (which I doubt really matters 35 years later now) I'd suggest Gygax acquired his role playing knowledge from the U.S. army's role play wargames.  Which, as a twist of fate, were directly influenced (some say stolen) from WWII Germany's training of its' elite commander core.  It's an interesting story I should find all the details for some time.

Not the specific game <i>Kriegspiel</i> per se, but any fictional RPG created before or during the 1970's is what I was referring to.  No one was even talking about anything called Drama Therapy until the very late 1970's and then the community didn't form until well into the 80's. (This is the same 60's-70's self empowerment movement that lead to Art Therapy as well).  <br/><br/>I do know that non-fictional RPGs existed before fictional ones, if you count 1974's D&amp;D as the first of the latter.  By fictional I mean role playing games in a fictional world (or what Gygax termed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fantasy role playing games</span> without intending to mean fantasy in the genre sense).  SimSoc is a non-fictional RPG created in 1966 to teach about sociology and political science.  And as I mentioned before the Army has used role playing wargames since post-WWII. These have a game element to them as they include rewards for whichever side won the "play soldier" weekend RP exercise.  It seems obvious to me that with this non-fictional role playing by the Army going on, playing a weekend warrior in a fantasy world was a sure fire win for real soldiers.  (And this popularity still lasts.  There are even rules in the Armed Forces about how officers cannot play RPGs with enlisted soldiers).<br/><br/>If we wanted to be really serious about what role playing was, I think we'd just read the seminal work published back in 1923 <i>The Theatre of Spontaneity</i> or one of the many listed <a href="http://www.blatner.com/adam/psyntbk/role-theory-bibliography.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> by Dr. Blatner, a psychiatrist and professor of psychodrama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188203/#Comment_188203" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T21:28:37+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  9:28PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm afraid you've lost me '99.

I'd love to learn just how D&amp;D and the other 70's games were titled RPGs.  I find it hard to believe that any one could have suggested the therapy definition as it was far less known than the role training definition (which had a huge boom through the 50's and 60's).  Not to mention psychotherapy role playing didn't even use fictional characters or fictional worlds until the 80s (excluding things like doubling).  I'd still like to read the conversation though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188377/#Comment_188377" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T18:20:51+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  6:20PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2009 7:11PM by komradebob.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This sounds very cool.

Basically, it's where you let them loose with a bunch of people and animal toys and observe the "game" they create with them as they build their "world".<br/><br/>I get the impression that giving adults less obvious representations seemed to work better for them.<br/><br/>And yeah, Elliot has some great links. I'll pop over to his LJ and see what I can find.
