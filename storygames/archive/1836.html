                    No, this isn't a thread about armor class.<br/>
<br/>
It's about a man who's lawyer is saying that his client killed another man because he was obsessed with D&amp;D. For real. I got this link from folks in the CAR-PGa: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/9540.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/9540.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Anyone seen any other publicity on this?<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow...does anyone else find it particularly freaky that the guy's character was a samurai (or perhaps ninja, as the article says)? I mean...can you just sense the stereotype of the guy in question? Its like El Disgusto from the AB3 posts has come to life or something.<br/>

                            Interesting.  I was totally thinking that it was the weak-ass lame defense model... until, yeah, the killer OFFERED THE OTHER DUDE A "SWORD" SO THAT THEY COULD DUEL.  That's definitely a D&amp;D Defense more creditable than "I held up the 7-11 with a 9mm because I thought I was a rogue".<br><br>I am really curious as to where these guys worked.  Was it an office building, or were they fry cooks?<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Wow, this is great.  Once I get some clients, I'm going to use this one ALL THE TIME.  Not only does it keep people out of jail, it'll bring new people into role-playing.<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Now I want to find my old Crim books, and see how this is going to play out.  (We didn't cover insanity last year, so I don't remember off hand.)  It's actually a fascinating question from the standpoint of intentions.  Most states break their murder statutes down into greater or lesser categories, depending on the frame of mind of the murderer (i.e., Murder One, manslaughter, etc.).  Typically the defense on this is some variation on, "I didn't know that would happen/didn't want it to happen."   Here, you can't say that, because in a fantasy role-playing game, you draw swords to kill d00dz and take their stuff.  But what happens when you're authorizing an imaginary sub-section of your personality to do this?<br/>
<br/>
This is going to be a great opinion to read.  Let's hope the judge settles the "I Was Just Playing My Character" issue once and for all, so we can all cite to it on RPGNet.<br/>
<br/>
The sad thing is, the murderer has gained valuable Experience from this--just not enough to level up.                        </div>

                            Oh!  And if you big-time Theory Mongers play your cards right, you could offer to testify as Expert Witnesses about Immersionism.  In tort cases, at least, experts can make like thousands of dollars in a day (this guy sounds like a loser, though, so maybe he doesn't have the money for that).  You'd also have to deal with cross-examination, but it's still more pleasant than arguing with the Pundit.                        </div>

<p><a href="http://www.courttv.com/trials/flemons/102406_background_ctv.html" rel="nofollow">Court TV seems to be saying something entirely different about this case,</a> compared to what the mainstream press and RPG blogs are saying. The defense is arguing that Flemons attempted to avoid contact with the real world through any means possible, including retreat into a fantasy world. D&amp;D was one method he used to retreat into that world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.courttv.com/trials/flemons/102506_ctv.html" rel="nofollow">The prosecution says Flemons thought the victim was throwing shards of metal at him and calling him names</a> as part of a long pattern of abuse on the part of the defendant's co-workers. Flemons snapped and decided to get even with Williams (the victim,) but realized after he killed him that he'd gone too far and waited for the police to arrive and turn himself in.</p>
<p>This is notable because the references I'd heard about this before I checked the Court TV story seemed to suggest D&amp;D made him crazy or D&amp;D is being accused of making him crazy. That doesn't seem to be what either side is saying.</p>

                            These cases are always interesting in terms of how they assign cause-and-effect relationships. Sensible judges generally seem to conclude that "after that, therefore because of that" is the fallacy it is, and to attribute whatever other oddness is in the person's life to their mental illness rather than the reverse. <br><br>By coincidence I've just been reading <a href="http://www.ukhypnosis.com/gatesjudgement.pdf" rel="nofollow">this report</a> of a judgement on a case where the hypnotist Paul McKenna's show was claimed to have triggered off a man's schizophrenia. The judge found that this was not probable, that if there was any connection at all it had been simply that the schizophrenia was about to emerge and any unusual emotional experience would have triggered it sooner or later, and that in any case McKenna had not been negligent.                        </br></br></div>

                            Shoot, according to the CourtTV page, he was found guilty of second-degree murder (i.e., intentional homicide with mitigating factors), and will spend 18-39 years in a prison psychiatric ward.<br/>
<br/>
He looks like a really sad, sad guy who's had a serious history of psychiatric problems.<br/>
<br/>
Like, I feel awful that he's insane, and I feel terrible for the family of the guy he killed.  But you know, if you're a completely insane guy who's obsessed with D&amp;D--how do you even find other players, y'know?  If a huge part of your life is spent obsessing over a participatory hobby, just think how awful it would be to never find participants.  It'd be like if some guy obsessed with barbershop quartets only had two other friends.  (Not that gaming would have any therapeutic effect, and it would be a disaster, but it just makes the loneliness seem even worse to me.)<br/>

                            This sucks for the guy. Back in about 85 in the VA Beach area some locals were stirring up the anti-DnD people and some of us at the local gaming shop went out, being a bunch of either clean cut military or ok dressed employed types, and worked the 15 seconds of airtime to help change the stereotypes. But this is a shame the poor fellow felt that persectuted that he felt violence was the appopriate response. Sure the older I get the less violence makes sense to me, the older i get the less violence i want in my game overall, but that is personal.<br>
<br>
Side note, the one person who was doing some Horror Gaming with me ended up institutionalized. I do feel his issues preceeded the gaming but I can say yes my sole Horror Gaming Player went insane.                        </br></br></div>

Yes, this is only peripherially related to RPGs. It's not really a D&amp;D defense so much as a "Fantasy Life" insanity defense. Where the fantasy life happens to have been a D&amp;D character. Yes, in no way can you attribute any fault on D&amp;D or RPGs for the guy's state. As I say, somewhere right now, somebody else is also being found innocent by reason of insanity for having beaten somebody to death with a golf club when somebody else tried to play through on the back nine, because he was obsessed with golf. Yet nobody will say that golf made him do it.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand this doesn't do anything to rid the world of the stigma that playing RPGs, and especially D&amp;D, are associated with. Somehow if it's golf, the stigma of being crazy doesn't rub off on obsessed golfers. But because of the nature of RPGs it will in places. Notice how the media plays it, "Avid D&amp;D player Flemmons..." is how some articles lead off.<br/>
<br/>
Strange in a way that this should be the focus even though he's been found guilty. Meaning he wasn't insane according to the court. Ironically I hope he <i>is</i> crazy. What does it say if he's not? I mean he was there to duel the guy, and then stabbed him with a sword!<br/>
<br/>
It's also telling that he was bullied about his RPG habit. I suppose that there are some out there bullied for their golf habit. But I'd be willing to bet that RPG players are harassed about their hobby at a much higher rate.<br/>

                            Mike, <br><br>Word. <br><br>It also occured to me that the last time I got significant lasting hassle about RPGs was at a point in which America was in a turn of social conservatism, political upheaval, and looking at some long lasting political consquences as the result of long series of military actions, all of which was peppered off with some lousy shock journalism and an increase in grass-roots fundementalist movements of one type or another. <br><br>And I got a little worried. I mean, even though much of the case seems to be mostly logical in the actual court procedings, that has little to nothing to do with how people will spin this out in the real world. (Which has as little to do with the findings of the court as the moon does.) <br><br>Now, I don't think it'll effect me directly at all. But I do wonder about the little 10 year olds in south Texas coming up where I came up, and can't help but wonder if this will effect them at all.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Strange in a way that this should be the focus even though he's been found guilty. Meaning he wasn't insane according to the court. Ironically I hope he<em>is</em>crazy. What does it say if he's not? I mean he was there to duel the guy, and then stabbed him with a sword!</blockquote>
Minor point: I'm thinking that the jury *did* find him insane, which would explain why he was guilty of murder in the second degree (killing when you're emotionally fucked up), rather than murder in the first degree (killing with "malice aforethought").  It's just a guess, since I'm too lazy to look up Michigan's criminal code, but usually states break murder down into a bunch of different sub-categories depending on your state of mind.  They can't very well argue he didn't do it, but they can argue that he wasn't fully in control of himself due to craziness.  Under the circumstances, I think the defense lawyer did a pretty good job.<br><br>For my part, I admit I was goofing a little bit at first--I thought it was a unique and memorable defense, and I'm in school to learn such things.  (Turns out it was just garden-variety insanity.)  I feel sorry for this guy for being batshit, homicidally insane, and probably being more lonely and miserable than I can possibly imagine.  But I don't identify with him.  It sucks to be bullied, but you don't kill people over it.  There are a lot of awful, dreadful, inhumane outcomes in our criminal justice system, but they got it more-or-less right this time (pending the actual sentence, which hopefully will be closer to 18 than 39 years).<br><br>PS.  Michigan doesn't have the death penalty.  But if it did, D&amp;D would have saved this guy's life...                        </br></br></br></br></div>
