So that's one option that I know can work. At another such gathering, I ran Beast Hunters for four players (plus me) for just about that length of time and managed to get halfway through a 40-point adventure.<br/><br/>My main suggestion would be Inspectres. It's not nearly as much pressure for first-timers, in my experience, but there are lots of parts to it that allow them to spread their narrative wings if they want to. Plus, as a humorous game and an easy sell ("Ghostbusters RPG!"), it appeals to most people, whereas something very serious or a game with certain underpinnings (such as religion in DITV) might turn more people off. Or not--but that depends entirely on who your co-players are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

You could actually facilitate *two* games of Contenders at once, with four people in each.  Once they get the flow, it's dead simple, and you could do all kinds of fun things with different divisions meeting, etc.  That'd be fun but a little insane.  I love Contenders.  <br/><br/>The Shab-al-Hiri Roach can work for that many people.  For 8 players figure an hour or more per Event.  Print out some cheat sheets.  <br/><br/>The Shadow of Yesterday is a great middle ground that won't seem like moon language to traditional gamers, but it isn't really optimized for such a big group.  You'd probably want to amp up XP rewards since people would have less spotlight time to hit Keys.  Pre-gens would be good, too, so you could have built-in Key conflicts.<br/><br/>All this advice aside, you may be better off meeting with smaller groups a couple of times.  They'll get a much more personal and intense experience with lots more spotlight time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87303/#Comment_87303" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T12:36:38+00:00" title="August 10, 2007 12:36PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool cool.
