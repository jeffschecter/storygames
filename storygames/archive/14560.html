They were all familiar with story games (more than I) and I believe at least passing familiar with the game. I was the game runner.<br/><br/>I tried to keep the action high, starting with approaching HOUNDS. They got out of the ambush point in the ghost world, only to be followed by the SPIDERS they'd alerted with their movement. This put their contact, CARRIER, in danger, but they fought off two and then brought the building down, driving off the third. CARRIER told them that they had been ambushed by someone who was aware of the PAPER they'd been employed to fulfill and that they were in danger until they could get to NIX and have him cancel the PAPER. I was making all of this up as we went, incidentally, drawing from William Gibson and the like as much as possible.<br/><br/>CARRIER wanted out, and they decided to help him get to the RAILYARD before seeing NIX. For this they decided to steal a vehicle, but this sent out a signal that alerted the authorities and (more the to point) was picked up by local WRAITHS. They got CARRIER out and then girded themselves for getting to NIX.<br/><br/>Shortly thereafter, a HAWK found them. Efforts to communicate with it kept if from attacking, but did not allay its suspicions, and it even followed them into the ghost world. They made it to the BRIDGE, but learned that NIX wouldn't appear until they got rid of the HAWK, which they managed. NIX appeared, but so did KILO who they had earlier read enough echos to know had been the one who had set them up. They had initiated PAPER on him for this affront, but he could weasel out by either getting NIX to cancel it, or just killing them. The players could similarly either kill him or cancel the original PAPER.<br/><br/>The players quickly lost their own access to NIX, who disliked the violence, and therefore had limited options. They also managed to harm KILO, who they had decided was addicted to STONES. This opened the way to a deal by which both PAPERs would be cancelled. So, a happy ending, with potential for more since it seemed that KILO had been working for someone.<br/><br/>This all took us an hour or so, and I thought it was good fun, I intentionally kept my input about the setting pretty vague to try to accommodate whatever they wanted to do. They established that carbon-filament rounds were damaging to people and things in both the world and the ghost, that there were vehicles, that vehicles could transition to the ghost, etc. We decided that there were ghost counterparts to every world location and they used little cards to indicate this.<br/><br/>This was only my second time with the game, first as the game runner. I had some initial confusion about how to handle dangers coming true as opposed to coming partly true and remaining, and it wasn't until about halfway through that we reread the rules enough to realize that we could put in whatever dangers we wanted to a situation. To me, this meant that they could directly confront remaining dangers, rather than (or in addition to) risking the default danger, or that I could complicate things with the remaining dangers.<br/><br/>Here's what I didn't get, and what I have an email to John Harper about: how succeeding on a goal meant to affect the game.<br/><br/>The players hot-wired a vehicle to get someplace. I had not established the distance, or the trouble in getting there, they just thought it made sense to get a vehicle to go where they were going. Okay, but... so what. If they'd said they were running rather than driving, I'd not have said no to it, they might just have faced different danger. They had a vehicle, but no real advantage from it.<br/><br/>I guess part of this is my vagueness. If, when I told them about a location I told them about the trouble (if any) associated with reaching it, then addressing those troubles would at least grant them access to that location. I suppose another part of it is just the "fictional positioning." Once they had a vehicle, this opened the doors for other descriptions. It enabled me to send out the signal to the rent-a-cops to be noticed by the WRAITHS. They didn't use it for anything other than transport, but they could have used it as a ram, a bomb, cover, barter, shelter, or the like.<br/><br/>The trickiest goal, for me, was doing harm to something. You've done harm, or done partial harm, but so what? Maybe I was supposed to be rolling for the things that took harm, to see if they were incapacitated? One player felt as though two "partial" success on harming something should kill it, or whatever, but that didn't seem right to me.<br/><br/>It occurred to me later that maybe we were supposed to state the goals more clearly. Instead of "I commit to violence to hurt the HAWK," maybe "I commit to violence in order to destroy the HAWK" or "drive off the HAWK." That way success means it's gone, partial means you can still destroy it, and failure means destroying it is off the table. If I think destroying it should be harder than driving it off, I'm free to add additional dangers to the roll, such as suffering harms oneself, attracting the attention of more WRAITHS, or whatever, including dangers already out there.<br/><br/>If I establish that, though, it seems as though players without a care for danger could set pie-in-the-sky goals. It doesn't seem like it would matter what dangers I set against "I channel the ghost field to [accomplish the main goal of the game]." More dangers would, in fact, just make it more likely that the player would get a full success on his goal. Still, with reasonable players, in might work to pin more and scarier dangers on what I think should be harder goals. We'll see what John recommends.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331594/#Comment_331594" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T13:29:20+00:00" title="June 25, 2011  1:29PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny, last time I was in a G/E game, the players beat the shit out of their characters and were barely made any progress as we dodged WRAITHS while hunting down CRANE who had taken the STONES. <br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331827/#Comment_331827" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T06:40:39+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  6:40AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2011 6:42AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "how succeeding on a goal meant to affect the game"<br/><br/>I think it really is <i>all</i> just fictional positioning.  The G/E implementation of Otherkind just furiously propels you from one situation to the next.  Now what do you do?  Now what?  Now?  <br/><br/>The thing where adding more dangers gives the players a better chance of achieving "the goal?"  Yeah!  There are maybe two problems.  I think it works best if the dangers are compelling -- things the players can't ignore or shy away from.  Also, what's the problem with the players achieving the big goal?  If doing so means that five more things have cropped up that they have to deal with (and that's how it's worked when I played) then there's more to play -- a new big goal (like just staying alive) exists.<br/><br/>They got that vehicle and you're wondering what the advantage was.  First, it was fun.  And that's enough, really.  But also, now they have a vehicle.  So they have established the ability to do things the vehicle lets them do.  Go far.  Go fast.  Visit motor-sports clubs.  Whatever.  It changed the fiction.  And if you need systemic advantage, having a vehicle surely makes them "especially well-prepared<br/>for the action at hand" under some circumstances so they get an extra die.  And why wouldn't you tell them that their goal was far away?  The "rules" don't say you can't do that.<br/><br/>Also, I've stumbled with suffering harm.  Just describe it.  Whatever it is.  And putting death on the table when it's appropriate is OK.<br/><br/>And my experience is like Todd's.  The system beats the living snot out of the characters.  I think it's a known feature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331873/#Comment_331873" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T09:34:37+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  9:34AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We didn't get that beat up in our game, I think because of Paul's little hack - we all got to pick a specialty move, and doing that move counted as being 'specially prepared'.

It's fictional positioning, yes.<br/><br/>This bit, as you surmised, Paul, is key: <i>Goals and dangers are always rooted in the specifics of the action.</i><br/><br/>In AW, Vincent says, <i>to do it, do it</i>. Same thing, more or less. It just means that the goal you set and the danger(s) you face have to follow from the fictional action your character undertakes. If it's not clear, you keep asking until it is.<br/><br/>"I channel the ghost field so I'll be safe and happy forever."<br/>"You do not. Play the damn game."<br/>"For real. I do it."<br/>"Ugh. FINE. How do you do that?"<br/>"You know. I, like, channel it. And stuff."<br/>"But <i>what do you do</i> with the ghost field to make yourself safe and happy forever? Turn into pure blissful energy? Ascend to a higher state of consciousness? Transform into a puppy? What?"<br/>"I like the consciousness thing."<br/>"Okay. This is stupid, you know."<br/>"I'M DOING IT."<br/>"Okay, so the danger is you suffer paranormal backlash. Also, the danger is, you see too deeply into your own soul and realize what a tool you are, and that you'll never become enlightened. Do you want to add another danger?"<br/><br/>I'm being silly. But you know what I mean. The whole deal is the player has to say the concrete action their character undertakes so the GM can know what danger to add. If you gloss over the concrete stuff you're doing in the moment, the action gets abstract and the dangers get abstract and then you sit back and go this sucks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332163/#Comment_332163" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T19:26:31+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  7:26PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I love the possibility that he'll end up a safe, happy, unenlightened, self-aware tool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332173/#Comment_332173" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T20:03:00+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  8:03PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2011 12:11AM by John_Harper.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, this thread also reminded me to finally fix a thing in the PDF, so I just uploaded a new one.

What that tells you, as the GM, is that it's now going to be easy for them to get to the rendezvous. Maybe they encounter one more batch of Wraiths, or something, but the adventure isn't about them reaching the location, anymore. So, the car is like a little prompt for you: <i>stop thinking about roadblocks, and start thinking about what could go wrong at the meet-up.</i> Maybe NIX sells them out? Maybe NIX is being held at gunpoint by HALO?<br/><br/>They fail at getting the car? What that tells you, as the GM, is that (a.) they think the location is far enough away to require a car, (b.) they don't have one. You can just throw that scenario back at them, if you want: <i>so, you can't get a car, and you're halfway across the city right now. What do you do?</i> Alternately, you can bring something new into the mix, something that plays off this issue: <i>Well, you don't have a car. Which is unfortunate, because some HOUNDS are approaching from the West.</i> Either way, the prompt you've been handed is to have some fun with physical obstacles, and to make it hard for them to reach the location.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376621/#Comment_376621" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T15:57:55+00:00" title="May  5, 2012  3:57PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just played a G/E game and I think the GM was confused about the idea of feedback. Besides being frustrating, he also didn't seem to be using the rules on the player hand-outs. There were mixed age groups in the game, but the GM also did very little to address that (nothing, in fact.) Unfortunately, I'm going to use this session to support my own bias against GMs (you didn't really need one and this one made things worse.) Also, this GM seemed to think the rules were: Every player gets 1d6 and rolls a single d6 for every problem. Extra dangers were not taken into account. Goals + Dangers were not taken into account. The neat-looking rule of adding dangers so that you could get extra dice to roll and then assign results as you like... was not used. We just rolled a single die and the damn GM told us what happened. Over and over again. I can do that with any traditional game, why did this guy bother to print out Ghost/Echo at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376622/#Comment_376622" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T16:05:31+00:00" title="May  5, 2012  4:05PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, now that I'm calmer, second post: Why do people worry about "pie-in-the-sky" goals?

Or off the internet? It's fiction. Nothing's inconceivable. The wicked self-aware virus screws up the wires or the ghosts all become fairies due to some mumbo-jumbo dredged up as /loot. /Latch remakes the United States by shutting down all womens' bank accounts after a devastating virus makes most females unable to bear children.  The rebelling prisoners lose control of the mass driver and it impacts the Sea of Tranquility, thus ending a rather good Heinlein novel as if it was a terrible anti-freedom movie with that guy from Memento in it.<br/><br/>A lot of things may have happened before these "lofty" goals or it might be one suprising fit of inspiration, but things can happen very fast in the world of the imagination, even a world of shared imagination. But there's always a way around it. There's always something that happens next. That's how humans work. We don't want the status quo to change, especially in a threatening way, but that's what makes a story exciting. That threat. That possibility.<br/><br/>So, lectures I've heard given better by other people aside,<br/>Sanglorian, <br/><br/>You say you were flat out and outsourced roleplaying NPCs? That also argues for a significant improvement in efficiency (you wouldn't have to work so hard) and enjoyability when you dole out GM responsibilities to players (the classic way of "killing" the GM.) I mean, why couldn't the players have made up some of those dangers? They may have understood them better with less effort from you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379664/#Comment_379664" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T11:40:59+00:00" title="May 24, 2012 11:40AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2012 11:41AM by Arpie.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, here's a report of a session that went right.<br/><br/>Testing a theory that's been rising in my mind, I sat down with an inexperienced player in my group who wanted to GM really badly.<br/>I gave him a copy of Ghost/Echo and told him to read the rules. I said I would be his "general" and help him out if he had questions.<br/><br/>The other players in the group were... well, let's say nervous about this player's ability to GM (he has some social problems.)<br/>However, once play began (and once he got over his initial fear of improvisation), we found that the game ran pretty smoothly. It works for my group in that it earned some respect for this player that he badly needed.<br/>It got silly, of course. But a lot of that was just the tension breaking after the trust issues were resolved.<br/><br/>It also gave me some great ideas for doing a hack toward a rules system I really want to see made!
