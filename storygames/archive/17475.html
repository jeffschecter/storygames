My slasher series "Hair" is something we only play when I'm visiting Oulu, which I do only once or twice a year, so it's very occasional. The movies we make pertain to a sociopathic homosexual murderer with androgynously long hair (hence the name) and his travels through American landscapes; the stories are brutal and desperate, and generally feature an entirely new cast of player characters each time around. The latest episode was "Hair III" last spring, and it felt very much like you'd expect from a slasher movie <i>series</i>: the recurrent themes from earlier movies were there, as well as the desperate scriptwriter's attempts at wringing new ideas out of the formula. The big thing this time was that one of the players who'd usually played female leads in the earlier episodes instead took a cynical FBI agent as his character this time around; our slasher had attracted his attention, even if his superiors didn't believe in the existence of the serial spree killer. Great fun, and creepy as hell.<br/><br/>Dead of Night isn't just slasher (although it does focus on survival horror), but of the horror games I've encountered it's the only only one that's inspired me to do the genre. I'm not even a particular fan of slasher movies, as I much prefer softer psychological horror. It's one of top three horror rpgs of the decade, and the competition has been stiff.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395824/#Comment_395824" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T23:25:23+00:00" title="November  1, 2012 11:25PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Slasher Flick is straight up great.

Very easy rules wise, and the card draw mechanic keeps results surprising while still weighting results towards characters who have survived the most scenes and who have developed more friendships than rivalries.<br/><br/>Dread is another obvious choice. Simple and nerve-wracking.<br/><br/>Another one to check out would be Geiger counter. It's in beta, but feels as complete to me as any game I've played. <br/><br/>I suddenly feel like I need to give dead of night a try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395838/#Comment_395838" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T02:33:48+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  2:33AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're familiar with Ribbon Drive, I've written up a hack of it for playing slasher movies: <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/ribbon-drive/slashed-to-ribbons/" rel="nofollow">Slashed to Ribbons</a>.

It's very tightly designed, with a good sense of fun as well.  It is a nice blend of traditional structure with strong player agency, but in a novel way.  The player has a lot of control over how (though not necessarily when) they die.  You can also play with several characters per player.  Miller knows the genre well (not just the well-known classics).  The game is infused with the culture and tropes of those movies.  Definitely worth checking out.  <br/><br/>I've ran a one-shot of it and we had a lot of fun.   I wrote a review of it somewhere as well.
