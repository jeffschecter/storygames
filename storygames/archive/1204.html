                    No names here. A friend has designed a game which got a bit of attention in its first edition. I think it's a good game, and have played it. The designer wants to revamp the mechanics, and worries that as-printed it's "broken". He's reluctant to sell his copies for fear he'll get a bad rep amongst the indies. I suggested he sell what he has on hand, and offer a free PDF upgrade to all buyers. <br/><br/>When I played the game, everyone stuck through to the end and had a great time. I therefore disagree with the designer that the game is "broken"--yeah it could stand a revision, but most first ed's can.<br/><br/>What do you all think? What constitutes a "broken" game? Would a less than perfect (but still good) first edition damage a designer's rep?                </div>

<br/>
Let's say we have a game, Chess 2, and we tell everyone it's a great strategy game just like Chess.  However the winner is actually determined by pure chance (dice rolling etc) with little to no strategic decision making on the part of the player.<br/>
<br/>
That's not the game we told people about -- and it could still be a fun game -- but if people were looking for a "great strategy game just like Chess" they'll be disappointed.  I think White Wolf's 1st ed. Vampire game is a bit like this.  The background material suggests a game about struggling with inner demons and the angsty angst of being a vampire... and the rules are all about guns and katanas and kicking ass.<br/>
<br/>
A truly <i>broken</i> game would be something that made play almost impossible, really boring, or very predictable.  "Tic-Tac-Toe 2" where the first player gets to make 2 moves... that's a broken game.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be hard for an RPG to be truly "broken", but they could certainly be more or less successful at whatever goals they set out to achieve.<br/>

<p>That's a fair description from the designer's standpoint, Jason, but I think in the usage of players describing a game, "broken" describes a more specific thing. I'm going to try and describe it by CCG-analogy and example, and then wave a stick at a possible definition.</p>
<p>In Magic: the Gathering, when the Artifacts Cycle block (this name is telling) was current, there was a card called Tolarian Academy which gave you blue resources based on the number of Artifact-type cards you had. In the same environment there were a lot of Artifacts with extremely low resource costs, and Artifact generators, and a number of variable-cost blue spells whose effectiveness increased with the resources put into them.</p>
<p>Tolarian Academy was broken in this environment. In constructed play (one in which one brings a prepared deck of cards to a tournament, rather than purchasing new cards at tournament and playing with a deck made from a subset of those), it divided the decks present into (mostly) Tolarian Academy decks and decks specifically built to resist Tolarian Academy.</p>
<p>This means two things - the Academy focused play around itself undesirably, and it <em>sharply divided</em> play based on its presence: if you were playing to win, you <em>had</em> to take account of it, while if you were playing in order to display an interestingly-built deck or simply enjoy the challenge of opposing multiple different opponents, you simply didn't really get to play; you'd be eliminated too quickly.</p>
<p>That's broken, from a player's standpoint (or, from my standpoint) - disruptive to the normal or expected state of play.</p>

                            The Academy is pretty much, what Stuart said. We would thinkt that Magic is about many cards and combining them, and not a single card.                        </div>

                            On the contrary, the Academy only worked because of the untap land cards which came in the same cycle and also the Brain Geyser. It was more Windfall and the land-untap which were the doom than the Academy.

                            Hieronymous, I think the answer to your question about 'rep' is a resounding "No!" A first edition with rules that don't quite fulfill the promise of the game, but are still playable, followed by a second edition with greatly clarified/refined rules are not unknown in the indie realm. The Shadow of Yesterday is an excellent example.<br><br>Your friend is trying to improve his game, and that's commendable, especially if he's using Actual Play to guide his revisions. I think that selling the current, functional, edition with the 2nd edition not yet completed is fine, but that's my ethical compass and not his.<br><br>EDITED: unrelated plea removed                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            A broken game usually falls under one or more of these defining traits:<br><br/>1) The game doesn't provide the experience it promises.<br/>2) The game is not functional* without drift on the part of the group (add/ignore/change rules).<br/>3) Only one or two viable input strategies work, the rest are meaningless (see Shreyas' example)<br/><br/>People also point to specific mechanics or subsystems as broken, which suffer in a similar fashion on a smaller scale, without necessarily breaking the whole game.   <br/><br/>*"functional", being here, the group playing is able to come to consensus about "what happens" (Lumpley Principle) without having to guess it, bullshit, or flail about.                        </br></div>

Nah. That's like saying a painter is a greater authority on her work of art's meaning, or a parent is the authority on their child's validity as a human being. All it means is that the game doesn't do what he wanted it to *to the extent that he might like*, which is not the same as "not at all".<br/><br/>Let me emphaisze: the designer thinks it might be broken, I think it's good but not perfect. I bought it, for what it's worth, and I don't feel cheated.                        </div>

                            Hi Hiero,<br/><br/>Are you asking the question to find out the critical point at which a game is broken, or are you fishing for justifications for your position in your  discussion between you and the designer?<br/><br/>Basically, without anyone else here actually having seen or played the game, no one can give more useful input about it in specific.  Maybe the game is fine, but the designer wants something different out of it.  That's his right to choose what he wants to do with it.  Maybe the game is missing parts, or not working right, and your group drifted it and had fun with it- that also doesn't necessarily fix the problem of the game itself.                        </div>

Or it could be "This lacks something important" for example a game which makes combat important and central in terms of setting--playing up say gladatorial combat, stables of fighters social politics--then provides no rules for combat or social politics in a gladatorial arena may be broken.<br/>
<br/>
You might ask the desigher "What goal do you have for the game that makes you see it as broken?"                        </div>

                            Personally? There came a time in my development of Timestream that I said "y'know what, I just need to get this out in the world just so I can MOVE ON." There's some flaws with it's design that I'm not particularly keen on, and now that I've done some other projects I'm getting to be ready to go back and reconsider the game. But I don't feel bad about selling it, or anything - it does what it does, and I'm proud of its strengths, and it will be better someday. But, for me and for how my design process works, just getting it done and out of my life was way more valuable than trying to fix things that I don't think I could have fixed to my satisfaction at that stage in my design development.<br/><br/>So that's my answer to the mercantile question. My answer to the game design question is that I consider one of my games broken when I don't have fun playing it.                        </div>

                            I think a game becomes "broken" from a player perspective when players are allowed to do something mechanically that changes the game.  Shreyas' M:TG is a good example of this, where the card changed the game from "compete against your opponent using a variety of cards" to "beat the Academy".  In my opinion, a game that directly rewards min/maxing in a constant direction is also broken.  Under this, D&amp;D is broken because you simply sacrifice charisma for strength or dex or intelligence (depending on your class) to up your stats and make you better without also seriously debilitating yourself.  Now, I know people will disagree with me on that point.  And a clever DM will take advantage of the low stats, but mostly the game is designed as a dungeon crawl, and so rewards characters who can kill things and withstand being killed.  So, perhaps, D&amp;D isn't broken in and of itself, but it can <i>be</i> broken by the players.<br/><br/>The difference in these examples is that the former is broken on an inherent mechanical level and the latter is only broken if the players and DM allow it to be.  So, an opponent of the Academy is screwed unless they've constructed a deck to beat it, whereas the DM can still wipe the floor with the min/maxed character using the game mechanics if they think a bit outside the box in forming the conflicts.<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>

                            My impression is that the first edition has already been printed, and a second edition is being prepared -- and the question is, given the possibility that the first edition is not merely 'less good' but actually 'bad', should efforts be made to sell the remaining first edition copies.                        </div>

                            Emperor,<br/><br/>It's not bad; it's just not perfect. The question is, what constitutes "broken". I *think* we can agree that maybe a truly broken game shouldn't be sold. I would suggest that perhaps "doesn't do everything the designer dreamed it would" is far from "broken". But, I wanted to get the general consensus in this community of what is "broken".                        </div>

<p>Well, sure. But there is a wide streak of perfectionism among us, I think, and sometimes I say to myself things like "If it isn't perfect there is no point in designing at all!" It is a long and painful step to say, "I have limits and this perfection is beyond me right now."</p>

                            Hi Guys,<br/><br/>Having bought a copy of Mischa's game at last year's Gen Con, I found it very cool in parts but lacking explanation in others. I've never run the game, but I think I'd have to fly a bit by the seat of my pants to do so. Is the game "broken" in my view - no. Can I play the game as currently written - sort of. Does it need additional explanation to clear up ambiguities - yes. That could take the form of an extra sheet inserted into existing first edition copies, a PDF on Mischa's Web site, whatever.<br/><br/>What I wouldn't want to see is a second edition with no effort made to keep first edition purchasers in the loop of where the game is headed and offering the clarifications necessary to allow the first edition to be played as Mischa envisions it.                        </div>

                            I think a game is broken when it contains so many broken mechanics or broken mechanics of such importance that it ceases to be playable as written.  I think that's a high test.<br/><br/>I think a mechanic is broken when it does not work as intended, not in a small way but fundamentally does not work.<br/><br/>Concrete example.  In Orkworld there are rules for winter hunting.  If you apply the rules as written, the clan dies out due to lack of food.  The mechanic is broken because it is supposed to govern how the clan gets food over the winter but the numbers don't add up and the clan always starves.  You cannot use the mechanic as written, it has to be houseruled or ignored.<br/><br/>Is Orkworld broken?  IMO no.  The mechanic is a one off and isn't that critical to the game.<br/><br/>If, however, you have a supposedly gritty mercenaries game but your damage mechanic means that people can soak up .50 cal bullets without a problem, the game is broken because that is a key mechanic and directly undermines the playability of the game.  That incidentally is drawn from an actual play experience I had, where we abandoned the game as following the rules led to situations of such absurdity that we had either to make up new rules or play something else.<br/><br/>The term gets used way too loosely.  I think mechanics, and games, can be broken but usually I think it is used simply to denote something that does not work as someone would wish it to.  IMO something is only broken if it actively interferes in actual play with achieving the outcome it is intended to produce.                        </div>

                            To add, one thing that definitely is not broken, but which is a common use of the term is where a mechanic has an outcome that is not in line with one's preferences.<br/><br/>Example time.  I don't personally like Extreme Vengeance much, it supports a style of play that has little interest to me and generally there just isn't much in the game that does much for me.<br/><br/>And that's fine, not everyone will like every game.  Others love it and that's fine too.<br/><br/>But, a really common mistake is for someone who has preferences like mine to say "EV is broken, the results it generates in play just aren't realistic".  Well, that might just be because it's not about realism.<br/><br/>I like verisimilitude.  I like stuff to feel realistic.  That a mechanic does not generate an outcome that feels realistic may well mean that that game will not work for me, but it does not make it broken.  Confusing that leads I think to the most common misuse of the term, this game does not do what I want it to therefore it is broken is a non-sequitur.                        </div>

                            If you, as a designer, know your game isn't good, then I would personally encourage you not to sell it as if it is. And harsh as this sounds, it's not important to me as your colleague, or me as your potential customer that the game is as good as you've been able to make it, or that it contains good elements, or that you just needed to move on. If the hobby is to overcome this past decade's slide into beautiful unplayability we need two things:<br/>
<br/>
1. well designed games that are fun to play<br/>
2. a relatively reliable mechanism that helps gamers identify well designed games that are fun to play<br/>
<br/>
And that's it. And the thing is, what we currently have for #2 is pretty fragile. It's all word of mouth and reputation by association. Selling a game that isn't good as if it is places a stress on #2 that we're currently not managing all that well. And the thing is, there's absolutely no reason to put yourself in the position of doing it but creative denial (which isn't good for you as a developing designer) or personal pride. If your game isn't good, but it's the best you've been able to do, go to the community for help making it good. You do a disservice to your own critical design faculties by trying to convince yourself to put it up for sale as if it's good before you know you've made it good, and to your reputation as a designer and credibility with customers by actually doing so. There's no reason you have to put it up for sale before you think it's well designed. And there's no reason you can't move on to new projects without ever putting it up for sale. I have done so myself on more than one project in which I had invested considerable design time and for which I had relied upon the time and energy of close friends for playtesting and feedback. Did I feel guilty for having used the time and energy of my friends with ultimately nothing tangible to show for it? Yes. A great deal, in fact. But did they begrudge me for that? No. Because they know this isn't a "for sale" competition. And because they knew I'd benefited artistically from the project.<br/>
<br/>
When you put a game up for sale the implied proposition is that it's well designed and fun to play. If you know that's not true then the only way to honestly put it up for sale is to somehow directly address the assumed proposition by asserting the actual reasons someone might buy it (e.g. cleverness, historical or scholarly significance, utility relative to some other game, etc).<br/>

                            I think that everyone is agreeing that broken is often used like railroading is in RPGs, to simply mean something that makes the game unplayable for the player in question. Yes, its loaded, because when you say something is broken, you mean for people to take it as meaning unplayable for everyone. So you're trying to say here that the thing is so bad for you, that it must be bad for everyone. <br/><br/>IOW, this use is rarely actually correct. <br/><br/>The boardgamers have a higher standard, more like Max's where the game has to be actually unplayable by the rules to produce the effect intended. Some mechanic simply doesn't do what it's supposed to. It's not as hard a line to discover as it might seem at first. Even when the output desired is aesthetic. <br/><br/>If a mechanic tends to produce only one strategem, then the game isn't broken, techically, but unbalanced. Tolarian Academy is unbalancing, but you can still play the game. If, in fact, there is but one strategy that everyone uses, as in the game tic-tac-toe, then the game is a "known" game. <br/><br/>Broken is unimportant for purposes of whether or not to sell the game. That is, a game should neither be known,broken, unbalanced, or otherwise seriously flawed. So even if the problem doesn't in a technical sense indicate that the game is broken, that's not the guidline for publishing. "Hey, I fixed the game, it's not broken any more!" shouldn't be the cry of the designer who thinks he's finished with the product. Like Paul says, it should have been playtested, and it should have been fun in play for almost all of the time played. <br/><br/>No, it doesn't have to be perfect, no game is. If there are some small, localized, hitches in play, the game may be good enough for publication. The thing to look out for are problems that tend to repeat in playtest, or look like they will repeat. Once you've gotten to the point that all of the problems can be attributed to the fact that it's humans playing, and not to a systemic problem in the rules, then you know you're ready. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

Agreed.  And what would work for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> would be something like a critiquing  vocabulary.  I think we've got half of one from GNS and related schools of thought.  In other words, we can talk meaningfully about the parts of a game without resorting to example and paraphrase.  
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>That is, a game should neither be known, broken, unbalanced...</blockquote>
This is the beginning of the other half.  We should be able to speak meaningfully about how the parts of a game succeed or fail.  The rest of Mike's comment is "or otherwise seriously flawed."  That's were the rest of this goes.  I can think of a few elements that come immediately to mind, like clarity of text.<br/><br/>The benefit to being able to speak critically would be a stronger mechanism to both discuss the quality of games, and so improve the attention on good games, and direct attention away from bad ones, but also to be able to help designers improve their games by giving them direct, concrete criticism from which to work.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite>Wine tasters have a full vocabulary of words, which, by example, are well defined.</blockquote>
I think that is in part because examples are often not accessible.  If I am talking to you about a particular vintage and we don't have it to hand, we need a common vocabulary to discuss it.  We cannot access an example, so we need a proxy by way of specialised vocabulary.<br/><br/>Games though are made of text, I can quote the rule to you and we can both have it to hand.  In that scenario, I suspect it will often be more productive not to use stand-in vocabulary but instead to look at the specific example.  Particularly as it is very easy to think something is broken when it is simply too far from one's own preferences for one to be able to successfully play it, but may well be playable by others.<br/><br/>Example time again.  I bought the LotR game from Decipher, on reading it I thought it pretty irredeemably broken, without going into examples as it's not important for this point I thought on reading it that the game simply could not be run as written to deliver the kind of play it promised.  I took the view that the game overall was broken.<br/><br/>Now, it turns out some folk are playing it pretty much as written and getting a good game from it.  That means necessarily I must be wrong.  I genuinely don't understand how, I don't see how they can get those results from it, but they are and therefore the fault must I think lie not in the game but in the game's interaction with me.  It cannot be objectively broken if others are playing it and having fun.  The fact I don't understand how they are managing that changes nothing.<br/><br/>If we simply discussed LotR using specialised vocabulary, eschewing concrete examples, I suspect I might not have discovered that I was in fact wrong.  It is the specific example that shows that I am wrong.<br/><br/>Similarly, with that Orkworld mechanic, let's assume that I simply did not understand how it is supposed to work.  The only way to show that is to dive into the example, to get into the detail.  Concrete examples are terribly powerful, where one doesn't have access to them as is often the case with wine we need to find proxies, but where we do have access to the examples vocabulary might also help but the example itself has real power.<br/><br/>That said, I think broken is a red herring.  Knowing something is broken can be valuable if you are trying to use it and wondering what is going wrong, it is the first step to fixing it, but I don't think it has great value beyond use as a diagnostic analysis.  The value to me of broken as a term is it allows one to say "the reason you are finding x is going wrong in your play is because rule y is broken, if you fix rule y or replace it with rule z then you should find that x will work fine."                        </div>

                            Yep, that's what broken is about. <br/><br/>Just to give a concrete example of what broken really means, here's a broken resolution mechanic.<br/><br/>Difficulty TN = 13 to 20, as determined by GM<br/>Player rolls 1d6, and adds his skill rating to see if he exceeds TN.<br/>Max skill rating is 6. <br/><br/>If, in fact, the goal of the mechanic is to always produce failure, then the mechanic is not broken, but can be said to be grossly inelegant. Because you could simply say that all attempts to do anything fail as your mechanic, and avoid the search and handling time. <br/><br/>There's another term to add to the list, inelegant. I think that the names for problems are pretty complete: <br/> - Broken - mechanic can't do what it intends. Doesn't just produce aethetically questionable results, but simply doesn't produce the set of results it intends to produce. <br/> - Unbalanced - most or all players will select from a relatively narrow range of options, because others simply don't provide the same level of benefit<br/> - Known - like unbalanced, except that there is a known winning selection, meaning that all players will choose this option<br/> - Inelegant - the mechanic tends to take too much work (seach and handling, calculation, etc) for the benefit produced<br/> - Kludgy - the mechanic is cobbled together from existing elements to fill a gap, instead of there being a stand-alone mechanic designed specifically to deal with the need well (a kludge often refers to a rule created post publication to fill such a gap in the rules - as such, a kludge found in a published game is way ugly)<br/> - Incoherent - mechanic tends to produce play of an agenda that conflicts with the overall intended agenda <br/> - Ugly - mechanic produces aesthetically undesirable results, or does so in an aesthetically unpleasant way<br/> - Crock - a crock is a "handwavey" sort of rule that produces the desired range of output but in some other non-ideal way. For instance, having all weapons do 1d6 damage in BD&amp;D was a crock. <br/> <br/>One I created:<br/> - Incestuous - a feedback mechanism that's too close between rewarded act, and what the reward promotes. Often means imbalance, but other problems exist, too. For instance, giving a "Win a Contest" point every time you win a contest is broken, because no contest will ever be lost after you win one (or ever, if you start with one or more of these points). <br/><br/>I'm sure there's others that I'm forgetting. I also think we could check at boargamegeek.com for other designer terms like this. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

For a second, consider why you put it this way?  Why not go on for 500 words that start "On reading the LotR game from Decipher, I had problems with it.  Here's a bunch of examples..."<br/><br/>If broken means something specific: that mechanic or mechanics do not function as they appear to be intended to (either by context or designer statement), then that's all you have to say.  If I disagree, I can ask what specifically you found broken.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Now, it turns out some folk are playing it pretty much as written and getting a good game from it.  That means necessarily I must be wrong.

Is it possible that they aren't playing the game as written?  There are a lot of games that are broken as written, but spawn table-local systems that aren't broken.  Because people play them the way they want to.  And sometimes that means an explicit "maybe we should introduce hero points to fix this" and sometimes it means a simple eliding of broken rules.  I came into a 10 year old Rifts group that had been playing with their own version of the to-hit and stats rules, and were incredibly surprised when this novice player pointed out that the book actually said something very different.  At least, it seemed to...<br/><br/>And I'll grant that the reverse could happen.  I still wonder if we played <cite>Polaris</cite> as written or not.<br/><br/>Mike,<br/><br/>I'm completely on board with your definitions of broken, unbalanced, known and inelegant.  I'm resistant to the rest (especially incoherent) as being too special-purpose, or otherwise confusing.<br/><br/>Also notice that you're describing mechanics exclusively.  I'd also say that we need to adopt a certain amount of language to discuss text (as in the actual prose used to describe the game,) overall system, even presentation.  And I choose "adopt" specifically, because I think we could very well borrow some terms from other fields of criticism.<br/><br/>That's another reason I object to "incoherent" as a criticism of mechanics.  I find there are many Indie (and mainstream) texts that are incoherent, in the sense that when I finish reading them I still have no idea how to play the godforsaken game.  <br/><br/>And probably we should examine frames of reference of a review.  It seems that we should foster a cultural requirement that criticism of a game include a statement of the experience the criticism is based on.  Did you read the game?  Did you play it?  Was the designer present?  Did other players share your views?  What version of the text were you using?  That kind of thing.                        </div>

                            Fred,<br/><br/>I'm quite aware of "incoherent" having a Forge definition.  I think you'll find that it's use as applied to written prose goes back further, if we're citing precedence.  Incoherence is inescapably a GNS term, and one that not everyone subscribes to wholesale.                        </div>

                            Judson, you absolutely must consider the group you're transmitting to when using any of this jargon. Broken has it's own meaning prior to game design, too, that doesn't have to agree with my definition. So you can only use it this way with people who understand your usage. For example, if you go to Boargamegeek.com, and use broken, you'll get criticisms based on this definition. So people will challenge you saying that perhaps the mechanic in question is "nearly broken." <br/><br/>That said, the geek hasn't achieved anything near a consensus on the exact meaning of these terms, so even there you'll find variable use. <br/><br/>The point is that you should either establish the jargon meanings of the terms, or skip using them altogether, and use the longhand for them. <br/><br/>So, yeah, outside the Forge, here, and similar, I wouldn't use Incoherent. But used at the Forge or here, I think it's largely a good tool. If you don't believe in the concept of incoherence, then don't use the term to describe anything. If you find a text to be incoherent in the sense that it's not understandable, then use another term. Because, like it or not, if you use Incoherent here, you'll get people thinking that it's a problem with the game's creative agenda. Just as if you use the term railroading, you won't have people envisioning players on trains. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            Fred, you're completely right.  This discussion was about whether it's okay to sell a broken game.  And I'll cop to being part of the derailing crew on that count.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: judson</cite>This discussion was about whether it's okay to sell a broken game.</blockquote>
Um, no, actually. I have been having a running meatspace discussion with the author regarding whether or not it is , in fact, broken. I never suggested it was OK to sell a broken game (at least, I don't think I did). I was hoping rather to come to an RPG-centric concensus on "broken", as a useful means for evaluating this particular game.<br/><br/>We could, I suppose, discuss whether it's OK to sell an imperfect game. Paul's been pretty clear (and eloquent) on that score. I don't think he's asking for perfection, but is implying a very high standard. Deciding, even with hand waves, what that standard might be in our community is probably pretty important. Another facet to add to that particular thread IMHO might be a discussion of the appropriateness of free vs. commercial RPGs, given the proliferation of both.                        </div>
