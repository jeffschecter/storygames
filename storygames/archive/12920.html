On the bright side, one could read it as a "Here's how I GM My Supernatural Romance" and maybe get some value out of it.  The game itself took a little over an hour and a half - that's a win.  And this is also kind of a pat-myself-on-the-back AP because I think it turned out pretty well.  Still haven't gotten anyone else to playtest it yet...hint...hint...<br/><br/>Setting:  space opera, alien-human romance, PG rated.  Originally she said "Like Avatar" but we didn't want to get into the whole controlling a genetically-grown body clone thing.  My wife wants to be the alien.  We agreed on this the night before we played, so I had time to think of the first scene and didn't consult the Oracle.  Ended up having a pretty Star Trek feel:<br/><br/>Scene 1 (F/C):  Zoom in on a teardrop-shaped spaceship, onto the bridge, where the aliens look human but - (and here I was imagining something like pointy ears or klingon lobster bumps but my wife says) - they all have familiars.  Cute fuzzy alien familiars with big eyes.  The captain is female and barking orders to engineering, communications, navigation - but the Protagonist is not the captain.  The Protagonist is sitting off to the side, a reporter doing a documentary of the mission.  In conversation we establish that the Captain doesn't like or trust her.  (Ravenna the Antarean, traits: inquiring, observant, 360 degree camera/mic; negative: not trusted.)  Ravenna's familiar looks like a chipmunk with gills.<br/><br/>Scene 2 (P): Oracle: "At Play" - she sets the scene with me playing some sport of the future, but virtual.  (Johan Smith the Terran, traits: athletic, competitive, resourceful - I vet the choice "Is that someone you could be attracted to in real life?"  Sure, she says.    <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/>   ...the real me is nothing like that...!  negative: hot tempered.  And I'm thinking his Dark Secret is he's a terran spy.)<br/><br/>Scene 3 (F/C):  Oracle:  "In the neighborhood" - she says they bump into each other as he leaves the holodeck, so I go with it (even though it's technically my turn.)  I play him as kind of flirtatious, but not seriously, and she wants to see how to play because she's inquiring like that.  We roleplay a scene of them playing the sport together, (and I have her consult the cards to see how well she does.  She wins+narration, so) she does some jawdropping cool beginner moves that leave Johan pretty impressed.  (I'm not going to mention the traits we wrote down - we kept at it for a while but then forgot.)<br/><br/>(I realize we forgot to give her an aspiration, so what's she going to do?  We agree on "Trying to get dirt on the mission for her documentary."  No wonder the captain doesn't trust her.)<br/><br/>Scene 4 (P):  She looks through the holodeck records for previous games, and sees Johan make a disparaging comment about Antarean familiars.  Is he a racist?  Did he tone it down just for her?  It's not clear whether she's looking for dirt for her job or pursuing Johan at this point.  (I give her a gift card, either way.)<br/><br/>Scene 5 (F/C):  Oracle:  "Shared ride" - they take the elevator to the bridge together, (imagining a scene like Saavik and Kirk in Star Trek 2.  We originally thought he was the first officer aboard the ship, but then why didn't they know each other already?  So we made him a diplomat, a human / Antarean liason,) and he's needed on the bridge because they're about to rendezvous with a terran ship.  The captain of the terran military vessel does not want to dock and exchange energy (we never made it clear why the Antarean ship needed to do this) - but Johan talks them into it.  (Then I take a good long while, going "um um um" to think up this line:) Johan's performance is pretty impressive, and after the talk his eyes meet Ravenna's and it's like an electric shock - then he looks away.<br/><br/>Scene 6 (P):  They dock. Johan goes on board the Terran ship and a crewmember runs out and cries for help, says they've been captured.  (This is an interesting thing about it being a two player game with someone I know really well - here I was thinking that this made no sense, why would they have allowed the Parthenon to dock if badguys were in control, and in a big GM-less game I probably would have just run with it, "Yes, and..." but here I was able to ask a bunch of why's and we worked something out that made sense to both of us.)  See, the Terran Captain agreed that *only* Johan would go aboard, because they only allowed Terrans on a military ship, but really it was because a badguy had a gun to the Captain's head off-camera.  But some crewmember got away from his captors and went to warn Johan.  AND Ravenna gave Johan her lapel camera, so he got a video record of it.  But then the badguys came out shooting.  <br/><br/>(I'm like, fuck, how is Fate going to bring these two characters together now?  It's like my wife is working against me.)<br/><br/>Scene 7 (F/C):  In the firefight, the camera is disabled and goes black.  (Why? my wife asked.  So we can focus the story on the Protagonist.)  She has Johan's video record on her PDA - she shows it to the Captain.  The Captain wants to leave him and just get the hell out of there:  this isn't an Antarean problem, and the Terran ship outguns them.  She tries to talk the Captain into it. (And consults the cards.  Win+Narration)  The Captain gives her 24 hours - "But what are you going to do?"<br/><br/>Scene 8 (P):  Uses her PDA to reboot her camera remotely.  (Consults the cards, medium diff. &amp; wins.)  Johan is repeating, over and over, in case anyone hears, what he knows about the terrorists on the Terran ship - troop disposition &amp; number, etc.  She also looks for clues in the video record she has (Consults, medium diff, &amp; wins+narration.)  She notices the crewmember that flagged down Johan was Antarean - she could just make out the tail of his familiar in the video.  (We decided that the Terran ship was really harboring a clan of Antareans and the terrorists were against Terran-Antarean relations.)  Ravenna takes this info to the Captain to try to talk her into boarding the Terran ship. (No 'let it ride' in this game.  Should there be?  Consult, medium, fail.)  <br/><br/>Scene 9 (F/C):  Johan says, on the record he keeps whispering into the camera, that he's afraid he's going to die and he wished he did more than just play Grav Ball with Ravenna.  Then he says he shouldn't have said that and hopes she wasn't listening.  (Since we've been playing for a good while now, and Fate is in no position to bring them together, I decided to have Johan make the first move.)  <br/><br/>Scene 10 (P):  Ravenna really wants to save Johan.  She tries to rally support among the Captain's crew.  (Cards, medium, fail, my narration.)  They say "Why should we care about some *other* clan of Antareans." And one of the crew even says, "Why are you so hot to save this human?  You don't have a thing for him, do you?" (Or whatever the Antarean idiom for that is.) Ravenna blushes.  (And I give my wife a gift card for that.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291014/#Comment_291014" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T22:53:20+00:00" title="September  1, 2010 10:53PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene 11 (F/C):  The Captain of the Parthenon hails the Terran ship, asks why hasn't Johan come back and where's their energy?  The Captain doesn't appear, but someone else (a terrorist, no doubt) who claims to have the Captain's proxy, and he gives them the runaround.  (My wife takes over playing the Captain now.)  "You've got one hour," the Captain says.  <br/><br/>Scene 12 (these aren't really scenes but turns, I realize - we need a button to remember whose turn it is) (P):  "Are you just going to take that from them, Captain?" Ravenna asks, trying to influence the Captain yet again.  (Cards again fail.)<br/><br/>(Around here I realize I've been doing her card refreshment wrong, forgetting to give her cards+1 back when she loses.  Whoops.  I give her a few cards in repayment.)<br/><br/>Scene 13 (F/C):  (I escalate.)  While still docked, the Terran ship turns its side cannons on the Antarean ship and opens fire.  The viewscreen crackles to life and the terrorist shouts "Death to the Antareans, victory to the Terran Liberation Organization"  The artificial gravity on the Parthenon shuts off and everyone's floating.<br/><br/>Scene 14 (P):  (After some discussion of what exactly you can do in zero-G: ) Ravenna pulls herself using the emergency-in-case-of-antigravity handholds along the walls of the ship to the dock, opens it, and goes on board the Terran ship.  (Difficult, but she wins+narration.)  The dock opening was jarred in the cannon fire and she was able to open it when normally she wouldn't have.  She even picks up a follower who asks if he can come help, and gives her PDA to an Antarean so they can stay in contact.<br/><br/>Scene 15 (F/C):  There's a squad of terrorists with pulse rifles waiting for them - expecting a boarding party but its just Ravenna and one guy.  Ravenna surrenders and gets taken to Johan's cell.  (And in a moment of stupidity, I say that the Terran Captain and the new follower are in the cell with them.  I could have put them alone together!  Dumb-ass!  Somewhere around here I think maybe Johan's Dark Secret is he's working for the terrorists...)<br/><br/>(I lose track of whose turn is what here.)  Ravenna sends her familiar through the air ducts to try and open the cell from the other side.  (And fails.  I try to say the familiar's been hurt or killed but she says that's not fair and she's right - I'm supposed to prenegotiate bad-stuff stakes like that, and I forgot to.)  Her familiar comes back, scared. <br/>The badguys come in and drag the Captain out.  (Scary, and one step closer to having them alone together.  Somewhere around here I think maybe Johan's Dark Secret is that he's working for the terrorists.)<br/>They hear the sounds of the Parthenon undocking and feel the shockwave of them doing an emergency warp away.<br/>(My wife decides this is a good time for her and Johan to have a moment.  I start playing hard-to-get.  "Now?  With all this stuff going down?  You're going to have to consult the cards."  That's her first seduction draw, so I give her a gift card.  She wins+narration.)  They kiss and Johan talks into the camera/mic - "Captain, if our love ever meant anything you'll come back for us!!"  (Woah - he and the Captain had a thing?  How does Ravenna feel about that?)  Ravenna pulls away.  (So I guess *this* is Johan's Dark Secret.  I scuttle my idea in favor of my wife's.  She wants to consult the cards drawing on Johan's traits to convince the Parthenon to come back and rescue - but fails.)<br/>The bad guys come in and take the loyal follower *and* Ravenna's familiar.  She starts to feel faint in the absence of her familiar.  ("Johan catches me," she says.  "That's a seduction attempt," I say.  The cards come up win for her.) <br/><br/>Scene ??? (P):  We see the Terran ship - then, winking in around it, the Parthenon - and a fleet of Antarean ships.  (I think, wait a minute - you *failed* your "talk them into a rescue attempt" roll.  So I say:)  But they're not here on a rescue mission - they're here to blow the terrorists out of the sky.  They start bombarding the Terran ship.<br/><br/>Scene ??? (F/C):  Johan says he thinks this is the end.  "Kiss me." They do. (My wife's idea, honest:)  Kissing the faint Ravenna energizes her familiar  - one of the guards was poking at the nearly unconscious familiar with the butt of his pulse rifle - when it comes to life and attacks the guard.  (Consult the cards for the familiar:  success, I get narration.)  The familiar claws the guard's face, gets past him, and gets to the control panel of the cell and lets Johan and Ravenna out.  "Let's split up," Ravenna says.  (We're about an hour and a half in now and my wife is getting antsy to end the game, and I like ending the subplot &amp; the love plot at the same time, even though it's cheezy, so:)  "I've just found you, I'm not going to lose you again," Johan says.  (My wife wants them to go to the dock and get picked up by the Parthenon but I can't imagine a ship attempting that mid-combat, so I suggest an escape pod.  Consulting cards to get past two squads of approaching guards - win+narration.)  They succesfully escape.<br/><br/>(I made those last two consults easy, 3 card, because I wanted the game to be over and it was time for our happy ending.  What would I have done if the consults failed?  Probably just stymied them for a little longer and let her make more consults to find another way out.  (Like, they don't get to the escape pod, but there are some spacesuits, so they suit up and open the airlock...?<br/>I think the ship should get blown up right after they escape, but she points out there's still good guys on board and suggests:)  The terrorists know they're losing so they take one of the ship's shuttles and try to escape and get blown out of the sky.  They rescue the remaining terrans and antareans from the terran ship.  (I guess the heroes didn't need their escape pod after all.)<br/><br/>Epilogue:  (I suggest and start narrating the Spy Who Loved Me ending, and she gets the idea and finishes it off.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
