This starts every day at 10, unless you are injured or poorly rested or other specific conditions.<br/><br/>Your Will stat is your current total of Energy points, divided by 3, rounded down.  If you have the Strong-Willed trait, add 1.<br/><br/>Gain +1 Energy from [yet to be defined, but includes certain types of successful Action].<br/><br/>Lose -1 Energy from [yet to be defined, but includes certain types of failed Action].<br/><br/>Note: If you have the Prove Them Wrong move, you can roll that to turn a public failure from -1 Energy to +1 Energy.<br/><br/><b>Action Rolls:</b><br/><br/>If you attempt an action without attempting to Apply Will to it, then roll Skill vs Difficulty to see if you succeed or fail.  You are not over-extending yourself, and the range of outcomes is fairly predictable.  The GM should not embellish much beyond "it works"/"it doesn't".<br/><br/>If you attempt to Apply Will to an action, make two simultaneous rolls: an Apply Will roll and a Stressed Action roll.  Resolve the Apply Will roll, then resolve the Stressed Action roll.<br/><br/>To Apply Will, roll 2d6+Will.  <br/>- On a 12+, add 2 to your Stressed Action roll, on top of any Energy spent. <br/>- On a 10-11, add 1 to your Stressed Action roll, on top of any Energy spent. <br/>- On a 7-9, you may spend Energy points to add to your Stressed Action roll at a rate of 1:1.  <br/>- On a 6-, you spend Energy but don't successfully apply it to your Stressed Action.  Subtract Energy equal to your margin of failure (below 7).<br/><br/>A Stressed Action adds modifiers from a 7+ on an Apply Will roll, and then rolls on an Apocalypse World-reminiscent 3-part outcome spread: 10+ = yes, and; 7-9 = yes, but; 6- = no, and.<br/><br/><b>The concepts:</b><br/><br/>If you're not pushing yourself, then less is at stake.  It's easier to push your efforts when you're physically, mentally and emotionally energized.  Pushing yourself expends resources, though the thrill of success can gain some back.  Not every attempt to push yourself actually contributes; it depends in part on whether you are already exhausted or energized.  Even failed attempts to push yourself cost resources.<br/><br/><b>Alternate ideas:</b><br/><br/>Replaced the Strong-Willed trait with an actual Will stat, which is modified by current Energy but not reducible to it.<br/><br/>When you Apply Will, spend Energy <i>first</i>, then roll to see how much of that Energy gets applied to your Stressed Action.<br/><br/>The Energy you can spend on an Action might be capped by your base Will or current Will.<br/><br/>Thoughts welcome, as well as accounts of your own favorite "try harder" mechanics.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449496/#Comment_449496" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-15T07:42:28+00:00" title="November 15, 2015  7:42AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What type of gameplay are you trying to encourage? The minimal narration of outcomes on ordinary rolls would encourage me to Apply Will on almost every roll; rolling without Applying Will would become the exception, especially since I have a lot of Will to spend and it can refresh during play.<br/><br/>The downside of that is that almost every action becomes more complicated, as I'm making two rolls for each action I attempt, plus the outcomes of the Stressed Action roll are more complex than the "it works"/"it doesn't" of the ordinary roll.<br/><br/>How do the difficulty numbers of an ordinary roll compare to the AW scale on a Stressed roll? If ordinary target numbers scale to the difficulty of the task but the Stressed Action roll is a constant, then past a certain point, it's always to my advantage to make the Stressed roll, as that's simply more likely to succeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449498/#Comment_449498" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-15T08:27:49+00:00" title="November 15, 2015  8:27AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2015 8:34AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My intent was to encourage both narrative awareness of character effort level and strategic rationing of such efforts.  So, fairly similar gameplay to spending Fate points in Burning Wheel or FATE, but with a different fictional spin and player experience.<br/><br/>My expectation <i>is</i> that most important actions would Apply Will, but that the distinction would force players to consider what's <i>really</i> important, and do some quick resolutions for actions that aren't.  (Another alternative for "not that important" resolution would be coin flips or GM fiat or something.)  <br/><br/>If a refreshable pool of 10 is too big to make those considerations serious, then I should shrink it.  Kinda depends on pace of play; I was imagining this mechanic as implying fairly "zoomed in" play, e.g. covering pressure situations where the characters are attempting multiple significant actions in a few hours' or few minutes' time.<br/><br/>My hope was that the more complicated version of resolution would be fun &amp; interesting.  If it isn't, then I have failed.<br/><br/>Good point on my lack of clarity re: target numbers!  My intent was that Difficulty would apply equally to Stressed and unstressed Action rolls.  So I guess that means base Difficulty is 7, and any margin above that is applied as a penalty to a Stressed roll (so Diff. 9 = roll Stressed Action at -2).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449514/#Comment_449514" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-15T22:48:51+00:00" title="November 15, 2015 10:48PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another RPG that used an Energy Pool, though more as the central element of play, was the Marvel Universe RPG (the 2003 edition, not Heroic Roleplaying, which is more recent).

I want to make it very tempting and I am considering allowing players to add as many points as they want after they have already rolled.<br/><br/>*edit:<br/>I should note that everyone has the same number of points in their pool, and there's no way to get a larger pool. And if you run out your unconscious. <br/><br/>The only downside is that you get tired and your character flaws start kicking in. Role play you flaws and you get points back "the character scratched an itch." Every character has a section on the sheet where their flaws are chosen and during character creation I tease out what the choice really means to the player and their character.<br/><br/>I like the idea in theory but have yet to see it playtested at length in any of my sessions. One friend brought up an important point that "If a player feels like they will be punished if they use it, they aren't likely to use it."

This is still the one I find <i>most</i> compelling, though:\n<blockquote>My intent was to encourage both <b>narrative awareness of character effort level</b> and <b>strategic rationing of such efforts</b>.  So, fairly similar gameplay to spending Fate points in Burning Wheel or FATE, but with a different fictional spin and player experience.</blockquote>\nThe second bold bit is the gameplay fun, and the first bold bit is necessary for me to enjoy it as roleplay/experience/simulation/"character tries harder", rather than <i>just</i> gameplay.<br/><br/>The narrative awareness of character effort is really what compels me to bother, though.  There are plenty of other options for resource-rationing gameplay.  To me, that's secondary.  Having some meaningful fictional sense of a character's impressive feats of effort, or revealing choices of effort, is the coolest part (but then I also want the mechanics to support that, or at least not invalidate it).  I also think it's fun to leave effort somewhat unreliable.  Like, all sorts of things can prevent us from putting forth our theoretical best effort at a given moment.  Real life is an interest combo of poor efforts and half-efforts and full efforts and amazing efforts, and some stories have captured that, and I'd like to capture that in story gaming / roleplaying.<br/><br/>The mechanics in the OP are an attempt to get there like this:\n<blockquote>If you're not pushing yourself, then less is at stake.  <br/>It's easier to push your efforts when you're physically, mentally and emotionally energized.  <br/>Pushing yourself expends resources, though the thrill of success can gain some back.  <br/>Not every attempt to push yourself actually contributes; it depends in part on whether you are already exhausted or energized.  <br/>Even failed attempts to push yourself cost resources.</blockquote>\nBut there are other ways to get at that angle, and other angles too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454693/#Comment_454693" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T22:59:40+00:00" title="July  5, 2016 10:59PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random note: "I really care about this!" can be an <i>impediment</i> when performing trained muscle-memory tasks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454697/#Comment_454697" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-06T02:22:39+00:00" title="July  6, 2016  2:22AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good post, Dave.<br/><br/>Here's a random thought:<br/><br/>What if we simplify this?<br/><br/>How about:<br/><br/>It only makes sense to Push Yourself if you want to exceed your usual limitations. (No point doing it on a "regular" roll.)<br/><br/>Then attack a mechanic to make it somewhat "interesting".<br/><br/>For example, if your game is based on a typical "roll to see how well you do something", you change out the dice being rolled so that you have an effective boost to your skill level, but greater risk of failure. <br/><br/>Example: You're playing D&amp;D. When you Push Yourself, you roll as usual, but you DOUBLE your Bonus (whatever you're adding to your d20 roll). However, any roll under 14 (natural, before the bonus) is an automatic failure.<br/><br/>(Not the best mechanic - shouldn't have chosen d20 as an example! - but it hopefully gets the idea across.)<br/><br/>Alternately, you have much lower chances of failure, but the failure becomes much more dramatic.<br/><br/>So, you get a bonus to your roll, but the stakes of failure escalate dramatically.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>It also occurs to me that sometimes "trying harder" is about trying to create an unusually impressive result in something you can normally do. ("I've got to outdo my personal best, here!")<br/><br/>The mechanic in the OP would be good for that.<br/><br/>At other times, though, it's all about just squeaking by the hair of your teeth, but at something you couldn't normally do. Here, you'd want an increased chance of a *borderline* or partial success, but reduced odds of a *full* success.<br/><br/>Thinking off the top of my head, if this was AW, you could double all the numbers. (Fail on 13 or less, partial success on 14-19, full success on 20-24.) Then you roll normally, but you add 7 to your roll.<br/><br/>(Again, crappy example, sorry.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454699/#Comment_454699" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-06T02:57:36+00:00" title="July  6, 2016  2:57AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always liked Burning Wheel's approach to trying harder: there's a list of ways you can get bonus dice from your fictional positioning.

But, when you really do care about something, you'll almost certainly succeed!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454728/#Comment_454728" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-06T23:10:37+00:00" title="July  6, 2016 11:10PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, <b>Cthulhu Dark</b> can be really easily modded to use an Effort die (with built-in limiter, e.g. the risk of burn out or something).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454876/#Comment_454876" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T21:23:11+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  9:23PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a lot I want to say on this topic, but for this post I'll just stick to analyzing a specific mechanic from D&amp;D 5e, which allows a Barbarian character to "try harder" under a specific circumstance:\n<blockquote><b>Reckless Attack</b><br/>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</blockquote>\nYou could justify this in-fiction by saying that only a barbarian would have the mindset that allows them to override their immediate self-preservation instincts. That's actually pretty plausible from a "realistic" perspective \u2013 in my experience, it takes a lot of willpower to throw yourself into a physically dangerous situation. But:<br/><br/>1. You could also justify nearly any character doing this, given the right circumstances.<br/>2. I think the existence of this mechanic has more to do with D&amp;D's "present the player with a fixed menu of options" design style than it has to do with fiction- or simulation-related concerns.<br/>3. The way this mechanic usually plays out in practice is pretty funny. Unless a player is strictly role-playing, they'll carefully consider whether or not they want to attack recklessly. See the dissonance?<br/><br/>Additionally, just about every class in 5e (even the Fighter) has some way of expending a resource for temporary gain, <i>but these mechanics are overwhelmingly restricted to combat</i>. There's no "reckless negotiation" mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454877/#Comment_454877" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T21:31:10+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  9:31PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>3.
