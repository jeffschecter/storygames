Wizards, companions, grogs, and the covenant, and the interplay of all those are really fascinating. The magic system (or the concept anyway) sounds very cool too.<br/><br/>I flipped through the 3rd edition at the used bookstore today, but there seemed to be a lot of adding and subtracting of numbers involved and my eyes glazed over. I'm finding that lately the only mainstream RPG books I'll consider buying are those with a lot of engaging detail and color to mine for use with another system, which is what I'd do if I ever ran an Ars Magica game.<br/><br/>So, say I wanted to buy 2 or 3 books, maybe one main rulebook and a supplement or two. And say that I wanted the maximum possible ratio of color and detail to rules. Any suggestions on what to buy?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213289/#Comment_213289" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T19:46:06+00:00" title="June 18, 2009  7:46PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The old <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Houses-Hermes-Magica-Jonathan-Tweet/dp/188099254X" rel="nofollow">Houses of Hermes</a> book was great for information about the Houses and such. <br/><br/>Past that I always liked the Tribunal books best for details and color. Dragon and the Bear: The Novgorod Tribunal (Russia) was a lot of fun, slightly out of the common European center of the game, and it had Mongol invasions. Lion of the North: The Loch Leglean Tribunal (Scotland) was fun, and had a pretty memorable super-villain adversary. Heirs to Merlin: The Stonehenge Tribunal (England) was very detailed and cool, but had less of the lurid and pulpish elements of the earlier books and was more... I dunno, more gritty or less pulp or something. <br/><br/>Finally The Wizard's Grimoire, Revised Ed had a lot of numbers and crap, but also a lot of fiddly detail that was sometimes fun (like the way that books were made in the middle ages). <br/><br/>Anyway, I was never a huge AM fan, but those are the books that gave me the most fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213304/#Comment_213304" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T23:33:27+00:00" title="June 18, 2009 11:33PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear you on the system comments.

There's good discussion in the back of the book about Mythic Europe.  5th has some good material on Mythic Europe as well, good story hook discussion, and a little bit more on the Mystery Cult Houses -- Criamon, Verditius, and Merinita.  The threefold taxonomy of the Houses came with 5th edition, though, and though I found it excellent, it isn't necessary for your purposes.<br/><br/>If you're looking at used books, Core 3rd, Mythic Europe (3rd), The Mysteries (4th), and one of the Tribunal books.  Wizard's Grimoire is cool for inspiration on Hermetic Law, books, and spells.

Apart from that, every edition is slightly better than the previous for magic rules. Edition 2-3 are based on A LOT of GM's fiat in judging the spells levels, from 4th-on there are solid guidelines<br/>For character's creation, 3th is the worst, it really need an errata, A long one. This is the part where 5th is more improved.<br/><br/>As for color, 5th was written with the assumption that you should buy a lot of supplements (at least 3 for the 12 houses, instead of the single book for the 2th edition). If you buy these supplements, 5th is by far the one with more "storic" color. If not, as Renato said above, is lacking color.  But 4th is not much better regarding this. 3th has a lot of color, but of the bad kind (you could use it instead of "Vampire: dark ages", though: it was written to show that Mythic Europe was full of demons everywhere and it will become the world of Darkness. Most AM fans consider that one an Heretic edition, at least).  If you want to have a "all in one book game" the better one is still 2th edition.<br/><br/>(or you could play 5th using your public library as reference).<br/><br/>As for price, 3th is cheap (the printed really a lot of them), but 4th is free. And if you like the game enough, you should upgrade to 5th, not downgrade to 3th.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213534/#Comment_213534" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T19:02:56+00:00" title="June 19, 2009  7:02PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, Moreno R.
