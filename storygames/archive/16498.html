You get the gist of it.<br/><br/>The whole thing is about collaborative systems that can be tweaked and reprogrammed on the fly. Think about a virtual tabletop where you can write up some mechanics, or the power of a card on the fly and keep playing, automating some parts. So it's all about playing, designing and metadesigning.<br/><br/>cheers!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377913/#Comment_377913" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T03:38:46+00:00" title="May 12, 2012  3:38AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2012 3:39AM by Johnstone.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "These rules are as complete as possible within the limitations imposed by the space of three booklets. That is, they cover the major aspects of fantasy campaigns but still remain flexible. As with any other set of miniatures rules they are guidelines to follow in designing your own fantastic-medieval campaign. They provide the framework around which you will build a game of simplicity or tremendous complexity \u2014 your time and imagination are about the only limiting factors, and the fact that you have purchased these rules tends to indicate that there is no lack of imagination \u2014 the fascination of the game will tend to make participants find more and more time. We advise, however, that a campaign be begun slowly, following the steps outlined herein, so as to avoid becoming too bogged down with unfamiliar details at first. That way your campaign will build naturally, at the pace best suited to the referee and players, smoothing the way for all concerned. New details can be added and old 'laws' altered so as to provide continually new and different situations. In addition, the players themselves will interact in such a way as to make the campaign variable and unique, and this is quite desirable."<sup>1&lt;/&lt;sup&gt;</sup><br/><br/><sup>1</sup> Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Rules for Fantastic Medieval Wargames Campaigns Playable with Paper and Pencil and Miniature Figures</i>, vol. 1 (Lake Geneva, Wis.: Tactical Studies Rules, 1974), 4.<br/><br/>"If you are a player purchasing the DUNGEONS and DRAGONS rules in order to improve your situation in an existing campaign, you will find that there is a great advantage in knowing what is herein. If your referee has made changes in the rules and/or tables, simply note them in pencil (for who knows when some flux of the cosmos will make things shift once again!), and keep the rules nearby as you play. A quick check of some rule or table may bring hidden treasure or save your game 'life'."<sup>2</sup><br/><br/><sup>2</sup> Gygax and Arneson, vol. 1, 4.<br/><br/>"There are unquestionably areas which have been glossed over. While we deeply regret the necessity, space requires that we put in the essentials only, and the<br/>trimming will oftimes have to be added by the referee and his players. We have attempted to furnish an ample framework, and building should be both easy and<br/>fun. In this light, we urge you to refrain from writing for rule interpretations or the like unless you are absolutely at a loss, for everything herein is fantastic, and<br/>the best way is to decide how you would like it to be, and then make it just that way! On the other hand, we are not loath to answer your questions, but why<br/>have us do any more of your imagining for you? Write to us and tell about your additions, ideas, and what have you. We could always do with a bit of improvement<br/>in our refereeing."<sup>3</sup><br/><br/><sup>3</sup> Gygax and Arneson, vol. 3, 36.<br/><br/>Bibliography:<br/><br/>Gygax, Gary, and Dave Arneson. <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Rules for Fantastic Medieval Wargames Campaigns Playable with Paper and Pencil and Miniature Figures</i>. 3 volumes.
