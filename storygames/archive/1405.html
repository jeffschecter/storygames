                    (X-posted with The Forge)<br/><br/>I've been kind of hanging 'round the edges here, and on blogs, and now I'm ready. I'm ready to at least try to design a game. I've given some thought to some games I'd like to work on, and even have a couple of ideas about mechanics I'd like to try out. I don't have any notion that I have what it takes to make an awesome game, but I'm ready to get my feet wet.<br/><br/>I can just hear the faint chanting: "One of us, One of us, One of us"<br/><br/>So I have a couple of different ideas which I'd like to get off my chest here:<br/><br/>1) The Sandbox - a game about modern day Iraq that asks the questions "Why am I in this war? Why are they in this war? Why are we in this war?"<br/><br/>2) Play it Out - versatile like PTA, only instead of a TV show, you're working on a 3 act play about a particular premise. One or two protagonists, the rest of the players are in GM-ful supporting cast roles.<br/><br/>3) The Great Game - Espionage like I've never seen it done before. Where your greatest enemy is never the opposite side - at least you know what they're after. Inspired by The Sandbaggers.<br/><br/>4) Unnamed Carribean Revolution Game - About breaking free of oppression, regaining that which your fathers lost, and making your own destiny. Blending elements of Ethiopianism (predecessor of Rastafarianism) with other Afro-Carribean religions to address the spiritual side of the movement. That's all I know so far about this idea.<br/><br/>What I'm hoping for is advice on the following questions:<br/>A) What in the name of all that is holy have I gotten myself into?<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Which of these do you think would be the easiest to design? the hardest?<br/>C) Which has the most initial 'appeal' to you as a player/designer/gm?<br/>D) What's the next step, beyond choosing one to start on?<br/><br/>And any other advice you want to give. Thanks,<br/><br/>Dave                </div>

                            As for C, I find it easier, myself, when I have lots of little projects in different stages, so if I feel like my attention is waning on one, I can go work on something else.  And, of course, I usually find the New Game Energy will switch foci right back to the first one just fine.  Still, I'd probably suggest you go for the game for which milieu you're least comfortable and familiar.  (Why not most?  Because you'll be assuming things your readers may not know.  Least means you have to learn along with your audience!)                        </div>

<p>For D, I think the interview questions are a little overly aggressive, and coloured for a very particular style of design which might not necessarily be your design vibe.</p>
<p>I suggest really steeping yourself in the source material, living and breathing it, learning it inside out.</p>

                            Seriously, Dave, there's no good answer that any of us can give.  Read and play lots of games.  Figure out what you want play to look like, and design something that supports that.  Use the Big Three and the Power 19 if you want a Forgish game.  Post here or at the Forge when you have a <em>piece</em> that you'd like to examine in public.<br/><br/>Most of all, though, good luck.                        </div>

                            One thing to note, Dave - you've amply demonstrated that you are a stand-up guy.  So that will help when it comes time to get feedback and playtests, because people will know they aren't wasting their precious time when they help you out - sad but true.  You can help yourself even more by aggressively helping other designers with the same things you're going to want and need.  Golden rule and all, and by helping others test and fix their projects, you'll learn a ton about your own.<br/><br/>Also - no more fawning "gee, I'm new, what do you guys like?" posts.  That's crap.  Just do good work that makes you happy and to hell with what some ambiguous <em>we</em> thinks.  Look at MarkV, for God's sake - his games come from <em>outer space</em>.  And they are routinely unalloyed awesome, and speak to a singular vision I can only stand back and admire.                        </div>

I'm fascinated that you've hit the premise for two of my fuzzier projects.  Not dead on, but really close.  Proscenium has yet to get keystroke one, and is completely built around the staging of the play of the story.  Including having a little model stage to move characters around for blocking and whatnot.  The Gritty Spy Game (which needs a better name) is completely borne out of me reading Greg Rucka's <cite>Queen &amp; Country</cite> and wanting to play Paul Crocker.<br/><br/>So those two have an audience, because I want to at least see what you'll do with the premise.<br/><br/>The Sandbox and the Caribbean Revolution sound like games you have a personal drive and interest in, and both sound like they could be cool.  If you're going to do the Sandbox, definitely either decide to do the abstract At War case, or get it moving quickly, because a game about Iraq is going to have a limited lifespan.

Seconded.  The less this is a social tea outing, and the more it's an old school, don't-trample-the-fallen mosh pit, the better. Get out there and crack some heads!  (So that the light pours in)                        </div>

                            Okay, let's assume I've pulled out my subbed-anime accent and yelled "Ganbatta!" several times to encourage you.  Now, here's the hard stuff that I wouldn't even bother saying, 'cept that I respect you so much.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> don't interest me.  At all.  Whatever there is that excites you about them, either (a) it's not my bag or (b) you haven't communicated it.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> interests me only if it is a LARP, and people are actually, really, acting out the play in some real way.  At a table?  Eh.  Until I hear what structural elements of a play you're going to use to leverage people's creativity (and how they're as universal and powerful as similar things in TV) I'm inclined to just run a session of PTA.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> interests me because of the way that the Ethiopianist religion can act as a shield that distances us from the fact that these stories are [i]our[/i] stories (and therefore lets us tell more powerful stories, the way hot-mitts let you deal with things in a hotter oven).  If you were kidnapping people and treating them with herbs to make them your zombie servitors then that would add another layer of awesome shielding, to tell even more pointed stories (particularly, in this case, about slavery and dignity).<br/><br/>I say, in no way disparagingly, that you may have different takes on those, and that will likely mean that I, personally, have no interest in [i]any[/i] of your proposed games.  That's as it should be.  You should do them because you're interested in them, not because I am.  But hey, validation's nice too.<br/><br/>Anyone else got comments on the specific game ideas that Dave is floating here?                        </div>

                            More advice to take or ignore:<br/><br/>Pick something and do it until it's done.  This should take like, at most, a few weeks.  Maybe a month.  Some people do it in a few days through Game Chef, or the Ronnies, or the 24-hour game challenge.  It doesn't have to be perfect.  In fact, it won't be perfect.  It will most likely be awful.  But it'll have some good ideas in there, it will teach us more about who you are as a designer, and, most importantly, it'll teach you more about design and yourself than you can possibly imagine.<br/><br/>One can waste years worth of time, if one wants, just thinking about games one wants to write, while not actually writing anything. Don't think everything you write has to be publishable or even half-decent.  There lies <i>The Path of Getting Nothing Done</i>.  Write one or more short games which are mostly crap.  Then maybe pick one that really inspires you and make it really playable.  Maybe publish it or maybe don't.  Maybe just give it away for free.  Whatever you like.  And then write another one. This is <i>The Path of Doing Stuff</i>.<br/><br/>And play a lot of games. Especially ones you don't know. Or ones with mechanics that you're not sure you understand. Or ones by people who say stuff that you think is really swell.                        </div>

<b>A) What in the name of all that is holy have I gotten myself into?</b><br/>A creative endeavor.<br/><br/><b><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Which of these do you think would be the easiest to design? the hardest?</b><br/>No idea. All four of your ideas are things that I seriously doubt I could hope to do any justice. On the plus side, that shows me you're using your own experiences and interests, which is a Good Thing.<br/><br/><b>C) Which has the most initial 'appeal' to you as a player/designer/gm?</b><br/>None of them really grabs me as a must-have, but then that's partly to do with my twisted manga-influenced tastes -- part of why I design games is because there's all these games I want that few if any other people would try to make. If I had all four in front of me and were picking one to run for my friends, I'd be tempted to go with The Sandbox. But your own answer to that question is a million times more important than mine. I don't try to make a game if I think I won't play it with my friends.<br/><br/><b>D) What's the next step, beyond choosing one to start on?</b><br/>Sit down and start desinging stuff. Where you begin, and whether you're typing on a computer or scribbling in a notebook doesn't really matter.                        </div>

                            Wow. Thank you. You guys rule. 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: markv</cite>I recently asked why there weren't more games about Iraq</blockquote>
I know, I saw that, but I didn't want to bust in and be like "Hey! I've got a vaporware game about this!". Didn't seem constructive at the time.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>no more fawning "gee, I'm new, what do you guys like?" posts.  That's crap.</blockquote>
That's fair. 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Most of all, though, good luck</blockquote>
Thanks! Clearly I'm gonna need it.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite><br/>I'm fascinated that you've hit the premise for two of my fuzzier projects</blockquote>
Yeah, and a while back, somebody (was it Brand?) hit on something like the Play one where people were suggesting games for publications and the publication was "Stage" magazine. I'll be interested to see what comes of your work on either of those, too. 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>Everything else is chaff; wisk it away</blockquote>
Which is why I want to be just like Fred. Except, technically, shouldn't I be threshing it away? Just sayin'.<br/>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meguey</cite>What's the one you get most excited talking about, or the one you start thinking about when you're in the car, or doing dishes, or lying in bed?</blockquote> All of them, sadly. Which is the suck of having an idea that you've talked about before.<br/><br/>Jonathan Walton's advice is so good for me that it's worth writing out in longhand once before every design session. Tony doesn't know it yet, but I'm going to subvert him into playtests that don't appeal to him until he screams for more. <br/><br/>I think I've made my decision. I'll post when there's news.                        </div>

                            if its not overwhelming... Let me say i would love to see a modern iraq game, but it will need to have something to it that's ballsy and engaging. <br/><br/>read some of Brian Wood's DMZ. Punch me in the head like that. <br/><br/>I could dress up "carry" in desert tan and have a great time. What does your new thing bring to the table?<br/><br/>The carib thing sounds real cool, mainly because i know nothing about that history.<br/><br/>This is the opinion of someone who does not matter in the answering of your 4 questions.

Yep.  Dave, if you're equally passionate about all things, and don't mind the possibility of taking a LOT of heat from the wider gaming public, I would be all over a game that cuts close to the bone on this one.  Give me a current issue and bravery and passion in the execution of that as a premise and I'll be pretty damn happy.<br/><br/>EDIT: Which, putting on my biz hat, is me saying, if you don't mind doing that as a passion project, I think you could go great places with it, but I have no idea if it'll sell much at all.                        </div>
