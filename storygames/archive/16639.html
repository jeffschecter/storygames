The vestiges of Russian civilization survive in underground bunkers, built a decade ago in preparation for the possibility of atomic war. You are a pilot, one of the few brave (or foolish) enough to take to the surface encased in the safety of your robot, a machine scrapped together from the remnants of the industrial Soviet state. What will you be able to rebuild?</em><br/><br/><a href="http://www.ndpdesign.com/ndp-microgames/" rel="nofollow">Here's the microgame general info page</a><br/><br/><a href="http://ndpdesign.bigcartel.com/" rel="nofollow">Here's the ndp design online store</a><br/><br/>Now that there's more than one microgame, I've restructured how they work a little bit. You can buy either issue in print for $5, you can buy both of them for $8, or you can buy access to the PDF library (which includes both games) for $2. All print purchases include access to the PDF library. All of these options are available through the ndp online store, linked above. <br/><br/>Magcloud is the printer-on-demand, and the mags can be <a href="http://ndpaoletta.magcloud.com/" rel="nofollow">ordered directly from them</a> as well (unfortunately, they don't support bundling, so if you want the two-for-eight-bucks you gotta go through me)<br/><br/>Yes, if you've previously bought issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, you get issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> added to the same download page, same access info, etc!<br/><br/>All of the library access is automagic for direct sales. If you've bought Be Ashamed Young Prince through another venue (OneBookShelf, IPR) and want access to the library, email me at n dot d dot paoletta at gmail<br/><br/>I'm happy to talk about either game, discuss the microgame publishing model I'm working out, talk about Kickstarter (which I used to fund both issues), or field whatever other questions you might have about these crazy things.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380659/#Comment_380659" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-03T20:38:39+00:00" title="June  3, 2012  8:38PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2012 8:38PM by Hans_c-o.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ndp</cite>discuss the microgame publishing model I'm working out</blockquote>\nHey Nathan,<br/><br/>Could you talk about this a little? What's your model here? Did you just start making little games and then figure out a way to sell 'em, or was the publishing model an impetus for the design?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380762/#Comment_380762" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-04T17:14:26+00:00" title="June  4, 2012  5:14PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure can, Hans!<br/><br/>As I'm sure many of us do, I have a ton of little ideas, game and mechanic notes, false starts and contest entries that have accumulated over time. I started going back through them, and realized that some of them, with a little work and playtesting, were totally interesting little games that were worth bringing into the world.<br/><br/>Also, I think that there's an underutilized price point for print products - the $5 impulse buy. I wanted to challenge myself and see if I could produce $5 games with an actual profit margin. Turns out, I can (as long as the page count is 20 or less!).<br/><br/>So, I'm combing through my existing work, and seeing whats worth the effort to make cool and short enough to be able to publish for $5. So far it's been contest entries, but there's some other stuff that I'm looking at for the next one. I haven't yet thought to myself to design something specifically as part of the series, but it's not off the table!<br/><br/>Part of the "publish cheaply at a profit" is using Kickstarter to fund the initial publication. So far, each microgames Kickstarter has paid for the art commissioned for the game, plus rewards and such. I use a "true" print-on-demand service, Magcloud, so I don't have to invest anything in print runs. The up-front capital enables me to have a higher production value, in terms of art and the time I can devote to layout and revision, than I otherwise would, and the game enters the world already in the black.<br/><br/>The big-picture model is to generate a catalogue of small, interesting, weird games, that can be purchased as a package or a la carte, which generates a small profit with each sale for the rest of their existence.<br/><br/>Hope that satisfies your curiosity!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
