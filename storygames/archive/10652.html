I just finished the second disc of Dexter, Season Three. I'll rent the next disc soon.<br/><br/>For myself, as a consumer, I've started to think about game prices in terms of what I could be doing with that money otherwise.<br/>Games are often priced higher than, say... the door price of going to a poetry slam ($5).<br/>Since I do performance poetry, I'm not losing out on that creative-participation-within-a-community-of-creators aspect.<br/>For me, a $40 game has to demonstrate itself to be more socially and creatively rewarding than 8 poetry slams.<br/>It also has to demonstrate itself to be more socially and emotionally rewarding than 4-8 concerts.<br/>It also has to demonstrate itself to be more entertaining than renting 13 movies from Applause Video, and watching 4 in theatres.<br/><br/>That's something going through my head when I think about charging for my own games, and when I think about buying others' games.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236214/#Comment_236214" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T15:03:50+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  3:03PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe also posted:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>(snip) I am saying that categorically, games do not stand alone, and they are up against a lot of pretty cheap, very fun pastimes.<br/><br/>I consider games as existing within the same realm as poetry, movies and concerts, in terms of my spending habits.<br/><br/>They don't need to compete with food, shelter, travel, home goods, education or alcohol... at least, not in an immediate sense, because I don't contrast a game's value to any of those things consciously.<br/><br/>I offer that data (what I contrast a game's worth to) because I don't think publishers consider it as often as they consider the insular rpg market.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236215/#Comment_236215" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T15:07:55+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  3:07PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I run the same calculus Joe runs, except I think about it in terms of hours-of-engagement rather than flat costs.

That is, that the price tag can be infinitely divided and carry equal weight in total.<br/><br/>For example, for your disposable income, you probably have a barrier below which the price is just not an issue at all. If I see something that I want and it costs five bucks, I get it. Some people will set this high and some low. Items below this bar are basically free, psychologically: a $40 game is not up against 8 poetry slams (for me) because that's 8 separate effectively free instances. I'm doing those anyway. Buying the game doesn't take them away from me. If I had to buy all 8 tickets up front, it would be.<br/><br/>Tack on the fact that quality and mood are relevant. A poetry slam when I'm not into it, is worse than worthless. A really bad movie alone is not worth anything. A bad movie on opening night with great friends is worth way more than the ticket price, but the next day would be worthless. So I'm also buying risk rather than entertainment, and have to weigh the chances I'll enjoy myself as well as how much I'll enjoy myself against the dollar value.<br/><br/>Short version: cash comparison is way too simplistic for me. Doesn't bear on the problem at all, in fact, most of the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

This was true before the economic crunch, but it's REALLY true now: I relentlessly examine all of my entertainment purchases and whenever possible opt to save my money instead.<br/><br/>Generally, I buy a book when:<br/><br/>1.  ...it's ridiculously cheap; $20 is as much as I am willing to spend for a big, fat all-in-one rulebook or a complete set of rulebooks.  Supplements or thinner books I tend to top out on at around $8, PDFs are even less than that (because I think they're a pain in the ass to work with).  I'm willing to wait to find a used copy.  I'm willing to wait for a new version to come out, too, which is why I have a D&amp;D 3.5e collection consisting of books I got for $12 or less.  <br/><br/>2.  ...I know for a fact that I'm going to be using it in at least one campaign and am reasonably sure that I will be using it in another one at some point.  I don't buy books on spec anymore.  I don't buy books just to have them on my shelf.  If I'm not going to be playing the game for at least two months' worth of sessions, I don't want the book.<br/><br/>Looking at that and figuring a 3-hour session as more or less the standard for our games, it's looking like I'm putting the value of a typical fat RPG book at approximately eighty-three cents per hour of gaming.  Which is definitely an entertainment bargain: clearly I am one thrifty, canny little shopper!  Toss in a little food money on top of that and it's still cheaper than movies and concerts!<br/><br/>(But like Paul B says, scarcity has to figure into this somewhere, too; I'll pay more money to see a concert gladly because it may be the only time I'll get to see that artist perform live for several years, whereas I know that even if I don't get a new RPG book, our group will still have something fun to play on Saturday.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236235/#Comment_236235" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T16:15:09+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  4:15PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2009 4:15PM by jenskot.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I buy most games because my friends made them, because my friends want to play them, or because they are innovative.

A new novel costs anything up to $25 with $15 being normal.<br/><br/>This means I'm ready to pay up to $25 for any RPG I'm interested in, just as if it were a novel. If I pay more, I expect it to be on par with other gaming products in terms of production values and I'll be just as picky as with board games and video games.<br/><br/>This generally means I don't really buy RPGs priced over $25 as there's no means to check beforehand whether my friends and I will like the game enough to get together and play it. I'd probably buy it after downloading it illegally, playing it and still liking it enough to pay for it. Just like I do with video games. Now the only "problem" is I stopped downloading RPGs illegally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236281/#Comment_236281" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T02:24:44+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  2:24AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is something else to consider.

They cost far more than an awesome novel or nonfiction book, aren't nearly as much fun to read, and don't typically have a way that I can read them for free (may god bless the public library and all who support it).  RPG rulebooks are just a bad deal all the way around on that level...which is probably why I settled on the "only buy the rulebook if I know we're going to play the game for at least two months" rule.  I'll get my entertainment reading from books that are meant to be read, and save RPG rulebooks for use in play (where their value is second to none).<br/><br/>But then, I'm cheap that way.  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236283/#Comment_236283" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T04:18:32+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  4:18AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, when I buy games I want to read but know I'll never play, it's usually for research reasons.

A movie is two hours, plus maybe jack-jawing about it with friends another hour or two, total. A game is... how do you REALLY measure that? A game could do all (or some) of these:<br/>* Provide one session of entertainment and never be opened again.<br/>* Help me pass Throne Time with interesting reading.<br/>* Surprise me with a technique that I can maybe appropriate for some project of mine (I've bought every LARP manual I have seen, due to this factor alone).<br/>* Provide entertainment AGAIN, years down the road, with a-whole-nother posse, maybe my kids (odds looking slimmer every decade), maybe at the retirement home.<br/>* Give me a setting... or art... or a particular cool NPC... to use in a totally unrelated game, or maybe even an unrelated-to-gaming manner (e.g. fiction writing).<br/><br/>This is why the Givens Principle works better for me than some sort of "Relative Purchase" metric: I can, usually, SEE right there, in my sweaty hands, what the book/product brings to me; and it's pretty easy to imagine more down the road. So all I have to decide is, "Hmm... could I make that myself? Is this just another fantasy heartbreaker, or a Mage variant/re-skin? Can I do this already with HERO or Universalis or MET splatbooks or by strapping BITs to a game I already own (etc)?" That stuff is easier for me to (somewhat intuitively, of course) judge than "Is this book worth the 'teenth I won't be able to smoke because I bought it?"<br/><br/>Tomorrow, I'll be sober again... and I'll still not have that cool book. Conversely, I might run a killer game with it for several sessions... being blazed up by co-players each time. How can I measure hypotheticals? <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236395/#Comment_236395" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T13:29:34+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  1:29PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I wrote a post here yesterday and it got eaten and thus I got frustrated about posting to this thread.<br/>I'll rewrite it soon, perhaps.<br/><br/>Basically: David, I don't consider a movie's contribution to my life discretely.

My money fuels an industry that I care about.  This is especially important with indie games.  I will buy a game and feel AWESOME about knowing that someone like myself is making money off of it.  <br/><br/>2) Fun-potential-generators - there is a chance, every time I buy an RPG, that I will get entertainment out of it.  Reading it, playing it, thinking about how it will affect other games or my view of the hobby in general.  Even if I never play a game (look at my shelf - there are maybe half, if that, that i've actually played) it contributes to the fun of every other game I _am_ running by merit of getting me to think about it.<br/><br/>3) My shelf gets bigger.  I am covetous by nature and having MORE books makes the Collection a bigger, more awesome, more satisfying thing.  This isn't RPG specific, but I will complete a "set" just so that I can feel that I have accomplished something.  *laugh*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236444/#Comment_236444" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T16:34:32+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  4:34PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reaction,<br/><br/>I was mostly meaning time in the sense that I have a limited amount of weeknights, and of that number I allot 1-2 to spending time with friends.<br/><br/>A roleplaying game session takes up 1/2 of my social time with friends.<br/><br/>Further, scheduling games is tricky for many.

I may have overspent on Super Munchkin considering how much use I get out of it, but on some nights, I spent way more than that at the bar with my friends, so Super Munchkin cost me less than a night at the bar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_236764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236764/#Comment_236764" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T05:30:28+00:00" title="October 10, 2009  5:30AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2009 5:33AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>JoePub</cite><br/>For me, a $40 game has to demonstrate itself to be more socially and creatively rewarding than 8 poetry slams.<br/>It also has to demonstrate itself to be more socially and emotionally rewarding than 4-8 concerts.<br/>It also has to demonstrate itself to be more entertaining than renting 13 movies from Applause Video, and watching 4 in theatres.</blockquote>This is correct, but then again: it is far from the truth.<br/><br/>Truth is YOU have to demonstrate to yourself what is socially and creatively rewarding to you.

Since I have a limited amount of money, I'm going to make decisions about what stuff I buy, and often I'm going to pass on stuff I might have liked because I'm prioritizing. Now, it used to be that I said "I like roleplaying games, so I'll spend $n on buying roleplaying games every year." And then I started to realize that most of my roleplaying game purchases weren't very rewarding to me. And so I started to evaluate whether a game was worth it differently... comparing it to all my entertainment/creative endeavor purchases, not starting from the base assumption that I'd be spending a given amount on games every year.<br/><br/>So, like... now I'm a much harsher judge of whether a given game is worth it for me. As a result, fewer games meet the bar. But those that do meet the bar, I appreciate more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_236965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236965/#Comment_236965" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T02:52:30+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  2:52AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite>So that works out to about 75 cents an hour for an experience of transformative, life-affirming joy.</blockquote>And that is an experience lasting for 150 hours, being shared with your friends all the way ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236993/#Comment_236993" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T09:13:19+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  9:13AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I once killed a bottle of Springbank 32 Year Old at a family function. <br/><br/>I also have declined to download free RPGs. <br/><br/>One of those things cost me lots of money.
