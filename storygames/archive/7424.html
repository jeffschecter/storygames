It is a bit of a "Explain to me why you created a game I don't like?" often with a harsh, offended tone thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>WTF? Why do you have to justify your game? To me? To him? To her? To anyone? If I don't like it, fine. I don't like it. I tried Coke Zero one time and thought it sucked. I didn't go to a forum somewhere and demand the chemist explain to me why he/she/they created a drink I didn't like. I just stopped buying it. Hell, I even gave mine away after a few drinks, and the next person in line seemed to like it just fine. I never told them them how much they sucked for liking a drink that sucked.<br/><br/>So designers, what is going on here?<br/><br/>What other product out there has to justify its own existence?<br/><br/>ME                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165056/#Comment_165056" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T18:19:43+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  6:19PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2008 6:21PM by Eric.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/twoflower/pic/00083hgd"/><br/><br/>Welcome to the internet.

In fact, I wish this happened more (maybe I should make it happen; although I tend to focus on likes more).<br/><br/>2) Many poeple who are asking the questions know that the author posts/reads here, and thus are looking to start an open forum with them, inviting them into something that looks like a MMA octagon crossed with the set of Inside the Actor's Studio with James Lipton.<br/><br/>Luckily, I never really see it get too flamey, or where the original thread poster is out to stir shit or stab the author in the face. Even the "I don't want to play your games, Jason Morningstar!" thread was started by a friend of Jason's (in fact, the horror from that thread from my point of view was people acting like it's *wrong* to not like Jason's games).<br/><br/>In any case, it's a cross between an interview and a question and answer session. These questions can be asked directly to the author in private, and indeed I'm sure they are at times, but some times the poster wants to hear from The Crowd, not *just* the author.<br/><br/>In any case, from a modding/admin point of view, they almost always are more explanatory than flamey, more a conversation than a soapbox, so I'm totally fine with their existence here.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonLeigh" title="JasonLeigh"><img alt="JasonLeigh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonLeigh">JasonLeigh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165058/#Comment_165058" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T18:26:14+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  6:26PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2008 6:27PM by JasonLeigh.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EDITED: cross posted with Andy.

Also, I should have totally loved "Sin City," but there was that scene with the woman losing her hand. That squicked me so much that I hated the whole movie. What an idiot I am! I could have just ignored it and the movie would have been great!<br/><br/>And Cowboy Bebop. Wooo! The show was going fine, but the ending was both predictable and foreshadowed to death. I thought the ending was so lame that I have a bad opinion of the series as a whole. I am such a tool. I could have just ignored that one aspect that I didn't like and then I'd think it was a good show!<br/><br/>Did you know that there are people who don't like Shin Seiki Evangelion because the last two episodes ditched narrative coherence and plot resolution in favor of character exploration? I liked them personally, but there are all these people who dislike the show when they could just pretend episode 24 was the last one. What fools! Also, some people stop watching popular TV shows because a certain episode completely turns them off. Sometimes it's as minor as one off-color joke or racially insensitive comment. Sometimes it gets the whole show pulled off the air. What's up with that? Why can't they just ignore that minor thing and continue to have a great show?<br/><br/>Wait, this whole line of reasoning is stupid. People like things or don't, and sometimes those likes and dislikes based on actual reasoning or logic. They might rationalize the rest of their likes and dislikes after the fact, but whatever. I bet you have very good reasons for liking the games that you personally like, and I also bet that a careful investigation of your neurology and psychology would reveal many of those reasons to be mostly ad-hoc fantasies. That's not an insult, it's humanity. But whether you have a good reason or not, whatever. Welcome to the internet. Bitching about things and making up new and fun reasons why is what we do here.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/><br/>This might be useful to you the next time you're dealing with these feelings of confusion and frustration:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t4/tobstv/fyouinternet.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165090/#Comment_165090" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T19:48:40+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  7:48PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2008 7:49PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite>I know it's not quite the same thing, but the various "sell me on game(or comic/tv series/etc) X" threads here and on other forums always bothered me.

They're the first thing I read in any game that has them and I'm more likely to pass on a game that doesn't have them.  <br/><br/>I'm glad designers like Jason find the exercise of justifying and/or answering questions about their game valuable, because I get to read the resulting dialogue and it's like extended design notes/"Behind the Music" to me.  I understand there's a difference between answering questions and justifying but also see that they sometimes overlap.<br/><br/>In the case of the RPGsite thread and in the particular case of Grey Ranks, I really found it valuable to read because I felt challenged by the question of why the heck I wanted to (and did) play Grey Ranks, and why I would absolutely do it again.  I hadn't thought deeply about it (and don't intend to for most games), but I think Grey Ranks warranted it.<br/><br/>At the same time, I would never myself ask a designer why they didn't create a game I care for.  That seems like a waste of time on both sides.  If they asked me during the design process what I did or did not like about the game, that's a different case certainly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165362/#Comment_165362" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T12:27:29+00:00" title="August 26, 2008 12:27PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The internet sucks, as many have pointed out. <br/><br/>Also, any sub community of the internet is going to turn into a hothouse of sister-fucking incest really fast.

Especially when you exclude the middle and equate questions and criticism with demands for toeing the line and explaining why your game isn't perfect for me. (BTW, your game isn't perfect for me, what the fuck is wrong with you?) <br/><br/>Really, I think there is a difference between giving feedback and being critical and demanding that someone explain why they didn't design a game for you, and you personally, or demanding to know why they didn't follow your pet philosophy when creating a game. Its the difference, often, between reacting to something as though you want to understand or improve and reacting as though you have ownership or right. (Compare: "What if there was a way you could do quick combats without the full Fight! rules in BW?" and "Luke, you are being incoherent between Nar and Sim with your elaborate fighting rules, and after all the time we spent on the Forge together I can't believe you'd make a game I won't be able to play.") <br/><br/>Sure, the line is blurry and organic. All social lines are. That's why we don't yet have a perfect programing language to run all our human interactions for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165383/#Comment_165383" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T12:59:46+00:00" title="August 26, 2008 12:59PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Understand, I'm not talking about getting feedback, criticism, discussion, etc. on your game.

While I have no particular opinion on this myself, I find it ironic how last year around this time the local scene was abuzz with the notion that indie designs need more quality control and honesty in calling a spade a spade. But I guess that should somehow happen <i>without</i> calling designers to account for perceived problems in their product.</blockquote>\nSince that was brought up...<br/><br/>Man alive, did that cause all sorts of hellish arguments and some small exodus.  As a, uh, member of the "New New Honesty" back in February, I had hoped that by being more open about "crap" (whatever that means), that it would help future people create better stuff through public analysis of publicly-sold works.  To that end, I'm all for people calling creators on their shit (not just designers -- as a podcaster, I get called on mine), and people should answer however they want.  If you sell it to the public, the public has a right to ask (in private or in public) "WTF?" (And, yes, you have a right to respond or not however you feel -- the right to ask a question isn't the same as the right to have it answered.)<br/><br/>Personally, though, I've changed my tune, and just prefer to not give press to "crap."  But to answer the OP...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>WTF? Why do you have to justify your game? To me? To him? To her? To anyone?</blockquote>\nYou don't, at your discretion/consequence/peril.  But if asked publicly, your non-answer will be seen by some as a vote of no confidence or whatnot.  And if you're intending to keep up good PR &amp; seek sales, that's part of the show.

Well, maybe i`m wrong because i`m not looking at whole discussion as an indie game designer (though i`m working in publishing company), but i see one problem. If you want to gain new buyers, you must looking for a new blood and remember, that newcomers will read all threads about your game. If they see that only few guys are involved in discusion with you (and newcomer opinnions are ignored/pushed away), they`ll walk away. Without your game.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">If you mean "They can be balanced as both being very good things for a company" then I agree.<br/>\nIf you're saying that people bitching about your game on the internet is going to reduce the level of consumer interest in your game ... well ... I dispute your assumption. I'd agree that you totally want to respond to those people, and be an openly nice and decent guy about it. But don't get hung up on satisfying them. Some people just will not be pleased, no matter what you do. You don't do it for the complainers: You do it for the audience who can say "Oh, hey, that thing he's complaining about sounds like something I'd really LIKE! And look how nice the designer is in responding to him. I think I'll go out and buy this right now!"</div>\n</blockquote>\nWell, of course I agree that any discussion about a game is good and innovative for both sides - a designer and buyers and even for complainers. Brand Robins wrote about Luke and all this mess on RPG.net (I guess that Kurt Wiegel`s review of Burning Empires is a good example too) - and of course that`s all true - arguments or flames on forums make more buzz than adverts. If there`s no discussion, there`s also no chance to draw someone`s attention (OK, i`m going too far because I excluded people who are looking for new games on their own, sorry).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever you must be very careful with estimating people who are complaining about yor games - there is no unified criterion to do that, especially when your game draws attention of a small group of fans (dozens). Valamir said about people, who are called by Fred Hicks as a "player alpha" (I found it on one of the podcasts), but in fact designer should care about almost every guest on his site, not only fanboys and alpha`s. Why? Because he want to sell his game/idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I agree, that designer shouldn`t sacrificed all his life for making people happy, however he shouldn`t chose easier way too. There`s many designers and much more games (including free) - why should I buy yours?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deckard" title="Deckard"><img alt="Deckard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deckard">Deckard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165797/#Comment_165797" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T14:29:25+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  2:29PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Point taken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
