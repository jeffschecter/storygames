                    Working through the Power 19. All feedback welcome, particularly brutal truth. I'm particularly interested if something like this has already been done, or if anyone wants to throw me a pointer to something they feel I should be aware of before I embark further.<br/><br/><b>1.) What is your game about?</b><br/>The concept behind Fantasy Epic is twofold:<br/>A) Use aggressively streamlined mechanics to make a fantasy RPG that always delivers Fun Now!<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Use a highly structured progression system that advances the party through a campaign of pre-determined length as the characters themselves progress.<br/><br/>I'm going to bite from InSpectres' system for determining when a mission is completed. The party advances through tasks, missions, Chapters, and Acts by accumulating Progress Points, earned whenever the party succeeds in a relevant Conflict. Many aspects of the game are structurally tied to which Chapter and Act the game has progressed to.<br/><br/><b>2.) What do the characters do?</b><br/>The characters perform the usual tasks of heroic fantasy, starting small and taking on progressively more difficult and more important missions as they progress through the Chapters and Acts of the campaign, all the while also gaining in efficacy.<br/> <br/><b>3.) What do the players (including the GM if there is one) do?</b><br/>The players control their characterâ€™s actions, strategically manage their resources, and help determine the fabric of the game worldâ€™s reality. The GM provides strategic opposition and frames scenes based on player desires and input.<br/><br/><b>4.) How does your setting (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?</b><br/>There is no pre-established setting. At the beginning of a campaign, the players establish broad-stroke facts about the world they want to play in, and some details about those parts that are most important to them. The rest gets filled in by players and GM as play evolves.<br/><br/><b>5.) How does the Character Creation of your game reinforce what your game is about?</b><br/>Each individual character has a unique set of attributes, motivations, and goals selected by the player. The stuff on the sheet is only what is important to the character and to the player, and includes items which are structurally tied to the progress of the campaign.<br/><br/><b>6.) What types of behaviors/styles of play does your game reward (and punish if necessary)?</b><br/>Players are rewarded for playing to their characterâ€™s strengths, allowing their characters to fail due to their weaknesses, bringing their motivations and goals into play, and properly managing their strategic resources.                </div>

                            Hey man, here's the thing:<br/><br/>I'm like a hair away from just "banning" the Power 19 from this site. <br/><br/>The Power 19 is awesome for giving you ideas about your own game.<br/><br/>For the rest of us, it gives us no points of entry to ask questions or engage in any feedback other than "sounds nice".  Like, it's the equivalent of flopping your man-junk on a table for us to stare at, and we in turn glance and go, "Oh. Nice man-junk." There's really nothing more to them than that.<br/><br/>The Power 19 is an AWESOME tool to get your mind in gear when you're putting an idea for a game together. But for the rest of us, it's just like watching someone reveal a Tarot Fortune spread/narrative that they did on themselves. There's really nothing about them to get the rest of us engaged, and they're kind of a conversation stopper.<br/><br/>One of these days, I'll come up with an "Andy Six" or whatever, which would be just a number of questions that people can drop about Their New Game Idea, which are totally all about facilitating constructive feedback and engaging other people, right off the bat.<br/><br/>But otherwise, this probably isn't the best place for the Power 19 or the Awesome 3 etc. This place is best if you have a specific little idea about your game that you wanted to discuss, or an element you were having trouble with, etc.<br/><br/>Hope that helps!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            That definitely goes in my collection of "vivid Andyphors".<br/><br/>Mark, we had a discussion a while ago about the "<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=418" rel="nofollow">talky N</a>" which may give you some other questions to ask.                        </div>

New post forthcoming anon.<br/><br/>for-Andy Afterthought: I hit this site moderately often, and this is the first I've encountered this insight about what sort of stuff invites dialog and what doesn't. I don't have a good idea as to how to expose that concept to nearly everyone who comes in here, but coming up with that solution sounds very worthwhile.                        </div>

The general idea that I try to encourage here (and at the Forge to some degree when I'm running around the First Thoughts forum) is this:<br/><br/>1) If you've got a game brewing, and you wnat to share it with people... probably best not to. Save it for your blog.<br/><br/>Until...<br/><br/>2) You have something specific that you want to show people, like One Specific Thing. And that you request feedback on.  Something to start discussion and to keep it going.<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>3) Same as 2, but you're stuck on something.<br/><br/>These are the best ways to start discussion on the stuff that you're working on.  Otherwise, this place kinda turns into a messy design blog. <br/><br/>No foul or anything, I'm still working out all the fiddly bits as well.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>
