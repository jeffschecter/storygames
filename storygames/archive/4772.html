The supernatural element is a little underwhelming in the first book, but the creator assures everyone he was saving some of the choice bits for a second book, which will delve more into the dark nature of the 13 Colonies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people have griped about the game system, which is based on two D12s, but when I played I didn't seem to have any issues. The book feels like a good start to a game that needs more development, but the setting idea is really cool and I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did a review on the game you can find over at RPG.net. There are some other reviews as well that differed in opinion from mine, but brought up some valid points, so you'll want to check those out as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe high point, I believe, is the idea behind the setting, but that also is the low point because it doesn't get fleshed out nearly enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat help?<br/>\n<br/>\nME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107418/#Comment_107418" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T11:50:56+00:00" title="November  8, 2007 11:50AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

They started a wiki and have additional materials online, which I've been told do add a lot to the setting. I haven't had a lot of time to look through the different entries, but they seem to address some of the shortcomings of the main rulebook.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://almanck.wiki.zoho.com/HomePage.html<br/>\n<br/>\nME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
