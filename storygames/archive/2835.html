We've even had discussions on historical games <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=17" rel="nofollow">over here, too</a>.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about historical gaming more, because at some point I'd like to give it a chance again.<br/><br/>I was thinking, though: Many historical games that have been presented to me (like a vikings game I played) basically took a fantasy game with standard magic, races, and super combat techniques, and removed the magic, races and super techniques to make it historical (in my case, GURPS Fantasy).<br/><br/>At that point, you're left to enjoy the story to be sure, but the other cool elements that were in the game (magic, etc) have been suppressed, and replacing it is this need for the players to "enjoy the historic-ness of it all".<br/><br/>I guess my questions are:<br/>* It's hard to enjoy the historic-ness of a setting when you know little and the GM knows a lot, without forcing all the players to read a book or two before playing.  Is there a way to fix this?<br/><br/>* Is there anything that can be "put back into" a game (once magic and stuff is out) to enhance the historicness of the roleplaying? I dare say that I'm almost looking for a system tweak here. Like "freebie fate points if you make use of real historic events"?<br/><br/>In the end, I've had fun with roleplaying using something like Art Grace and Guts (Jason M ran us a Norse-themed two-parter that was fun, but the Norse stuff was basically trappings. It could have easily been Aztec or Ancient Russia) with the setting as nothing more than "stage props", with no real nods to historic events and the like.<br/><br/>But how about historical roleplaying, in a non-magical 'realistic' setting (any system, from D&amp;D to MLWM), where real historic events emerge and are played out? Where the players meet, influence, or even are major players in the game? <br/><br/>How do you dig into that when all the players aren't at the same level of historical knowledge? <br/>How do you make the history as something more than stage props and backdrop?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64397/#Comment_64397" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T09:08:06+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  9:08AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>* It's hard to enjoy the historic-ness of a setting when you know little and the GM knows a lot, without forcing all the players to read a book or two before playing.

As we discussed in the thread I just linked to, there's the risk of rewarding non-fun behaviour by giving out xp for historical knowledge, by encouraging people to derail the game with lengthy discussions about history or pointing out GM errors.<br/><br/>But there must be a cooler way of handling it. How about a bit like aspects? A game could have "historical aspects" that you could tag or incorporate for an advantage in game. So the history is still there, and the players can use it to lend flavour and depth to the game and their actions by including it, but it's laid out upfront and is used in a fairly unobtrusive way.<br/><br/>I like history. I'm less keen on history games, although I really dig the concept of them.

Provide the background on the fly and don't expect hardcore emulation or accuracy - tell your own story and accept departure from reality.  Have a name list.  In a long-term game, find ways to get people engaged and bringing their own discoveries to the table.  One way to do this is to encourage people to find real world NPCs they'd like to interact with.  <br/><br/>I've never had a problem with the lack of sparkly bits - all conflicts are essentially human, so taking out the elves and spaceships just seems like focusing on the stuff that matters to me.

Just reading them and including them in narration immersed us much more in the game, despite the fact we were deviating from history just by having the tanks rumble over Srednikowy Bridge or topple the Royal Castle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64404/#Comment_64404" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T09:33:49+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  9:33AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>* It's hard to enjoy the historic-ness of a setting when you know little and the GM knows a lot, without forcing all the players to read a book or two before playing. Is there a way to fix this?<br/></blockquote>\nI think Bob has the right idea (i.e. basically giving the players a "relevant facts about the time period" sheet at the beginning). <br/><br/>Another suggestion is to make sure that the players feel free to ask the GM "in brief, what does my character know about this situation?" so that he could be more grounded when necessary.<br/><br/>In addition, just like if you were running a fantasy game in a setting that the players are not familiar with (like when I ran Exalted the first time) you should probably start things slow and locally contained. For instance, in a game about the Avignon papacy, you would not want to start the characters off as one of the major players who are required to understand the tangled set of alliances and enmities that confront them ("Wait, I forgot... was Pisa in the Florencian anti-papacy league?" "No, Pisa was the one that killed all those rioters at Cesena" "Nuh-uh, I am pretty sure that was us..." "Wait, isn't Pisa also the name of the papal legate?" "Uhmm... let me check my notes...")... rather you would start them off as emissaries of a minor player who are essentially "told" what to do until such a time as it looks like the players understand enough of the setting to start moving up the chain.<br/><br/>The final big point is to not overwhelm players with lots of foreign names and places... focus more on the story that you are trying to tell (at least at first). Even set in the long-long ago, human motivations (power, greed, sex) don't really change and give an understandable and comfortable grounding for understanding things... and then begin to add in the subleties and eccentricities of the era as things go by.\n<blockquote><br/>* Is there anything that can be "put back into" a game (once magic and stuff is out) to enhance the historicness of the roleplaying?

If you start with thinking the middle ages is like a fantasy game but with no magic, well who'd want to play that?  If however you pitch a game about warring BIshops fighting for supremacy directly and via their henchmen across medieval Europe, well hell, that sounds more fun.  That latter game, Dictemus Papae in the current 24 hour competition, is a historical rpg with no magic but the game doesn't even talk about magic.  Why should it?  That's not what it's about, it's about being a scheming bishop.<br/><br/>Enjoying the historic-ness, I don't even really know what that means and the vast bulk of my gaming is historic gaming.  I sell games to my group, or have them sold to me when I'm playing, on what they are.<br/><br/>Hey guys, do you want to play a Vikings game with a feel based on the Icelandic sagas?  Marriages, blood feuds, some raiding, some trading, how's it sound?<br/><br/>Hey guys, do you want to play a game set in the French wars of religion?  You're part of the civic administration of a town being ripped apart by political and religious differences, trying to keep it together while advancing your own cause, how's that sound?<br/><br/>Hey guys, do you want to play a game set in 1770s Naples?  It's going to be all about con artists and adventurers trying to make a name at the Royal court and to gain their fortunes, how's that sound?<br/><br/>Those are all games I've played in or ran.  That 1770s one?  I don't think anyone did any research besides me and I did mine so I could throw in some period detail from time to time for colour.  But the thing is, none of them were about enjoying the historic-ness, they were about being Icelandic freemen or scheming politicians or fast talking con artists, they were about what the players actually do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64416/#Comment_64416" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T10:08:37+00:00" title="April 19, 2007 10:08AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an addendum, I enjoy historical gaming because I enjoy most games about stuff that resonates with me.  Greed, passion, revenge, fear, envy, intolerance, fanaticism, ambition, all that good stuff.<br/><br/>Historical gaming is rich with that, because history is rich with that, because history is about people.  All too often games with magic or cool stuff become about that magic or cool stuff, but I don't really care about that stuff, I don't find it that interesting.<br/><br/>Taking out the magic, if done well, means focussing on something else that's cool.  The something else I try to focus on is the human emotions, why were so many people trying to kill the Marquis (whom the PCs knew in fact to be an Irish fraudster)?  The answer lay in a mistress he dumped when she was of no further use to him, who has since herself gained influence, the plot wasn't about the mystical mcguffin of mcgoo, it was about revenge.  When you have no magic, you have to look to the mundane, and the mundane frequently contains real drama.<br/><br/>I like gaming to be about human issues, and for that for me (and others will vary of course) I find it best to stick to the human.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64431/#Comment_64431" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T11:52:11+00:00" title="April 19, 2007 11:52AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2007 11:52AM by Alex.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, this is kind of silly, but...<br/><br/>Anyone heard of or played <i>Continuum</i>?

Yeah, it's something you have to get a leash on, or understand how to use it for the good of all.<br/><br/>I was in a game of <i>Carry </i>recently, and I just wanted to know what year the game was set in. "Before or after Tet?" I asked (the Tet Offensive in 1968). The GM was able, after a fashion, to answer. I don't think the others at the table had any idea what the hell I was on about, and had that sour look on their face ("Oh, oh, a history Nazi.")<br/><br/>The reason I asked was so that I would know if certain Rolling Stones songs would be on the radio.<br/><br/>Smiles again. All good.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've run plenty of historical stuff without an ounce of fantasy or supernatural in them, and if it's about the characters and their drama, it doesn't matter how much history anyone knows. As has been pointed out, if you use the history as color, and do not get into discussions, or worse, arguments, over niggling points that don't move things along or have no bearing on the characters, straight historical settings are no trouble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64557/#Comment_64557" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-20T13:50:55+00:00" title="April 20, 2007  1:50PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2007 1:53PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is essentially the same as the worldbuilding thread, has anyone noticed? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>There really is no difference between not knowing much about the Forgotten Realms and not knowing much about Poland in 1796.<br/><br/>Why did I pick Poland in 1796? Because that's my next game project - a Vampire: the Requiem game set in Poland in 1796.  That's right folks, put on your bike helmets to prevent brain damage, JDC's going to talk about his Vampire game!<br/><br/>But first I'm going to tell you about a D&amp;D game.<br/><br/>It was set in the Scarred Lands, a really kickass setting concocted by White Wolf. I don't want to get too far on a tangent but the reason I like the Scarred Lands is that it <i>really really needs heroes.</i>  It's not like a lot of dark fantasy games where things are just dismal, in the Scarred Lands things are dismal but if there was just a ragtag gang of hot-cha adventurers in implausible armor who could come in with quips and derring-do, things might just start looking up. <br/><br/>Anyway, the game was set in a city that at the time had not been detailed by White Wolf. (Eventually it would be but I liked mine better and nobody else cared at that point.) I went into considerable detail in detailing the coinage, calendar, daily life, etc. of this fantasy city and gave the packet to the players.<br/><br/>Then I got really annoyed because all of the questions I was getting were answered in the packet and gps were still just "gold pieces", not the actual name of the coin. It was, in my view, killing the atmosphere I was trying to create. I was having these NPCs say all sorts of awesome stuff and the players might as well have been playing Greyhawk or some other D&amp;D setting. I got pretty pissed off, felt like my contribution was wasted, etc. That is the feeling the setting buff gets when people blunder over something they tried to establish, whether it is a fictional setting or a nonfictional one.<br/><br/>Afterwards I realized this was all happening because I was a fucking moron.<br/><br/>I had just given these packets to the players without explaining my expectations or goals.  What, were they just supposed to read my mind and know what I wanted? I put my attacks of opportunity FAQ in the same packet, for god's sake. I didn't expect their characters to say "hurrr, I really stabbed that guy with an attack of opportunity". <br/><br/>Fast forward to today.<br/><br/>After getting psyched about Vampire: the Requiem, I do what I do with all games - ruin it by doing something with it the authors wouldn't ever give a shit about and would think I was stupid <i>or maybe brilliant</i> for doing.  In this case, I wanted to run a historical game, but in a setting that most American games more or less shit on and ignore: Eastern Europe (hats off to e23 for their GURPS WWII supplements for Poland and Romania, though...).  So I took Napoleonic Poland (just after the last partition) and I wrote up a one-page precis on life in Poland in that time.<br/><br/>When I presented the page to the players I said, "I expect you to know everything on this page, and to use the terms defined on this page in conversation, and when I refer to something on this page I expect you'll be able to have your character converse intelligently about it."<br/><br/>Then I said, "If there is some historical question that is not related to something on this page, I don't care if you know it or not, I will be happy to answer it if I can, and if you forget the answer, that's okay, I'll answer it again. If I don't know the answer, I'll establish an answer as true for our game - after all, we're already positting that vampires exist, why not a little historical wiggle room?"<br/><br/>And: "If you surmise something that historically turns out not to be true or there is some historical reason that something you're working on wouldn't work, I promise to intervene and explain things. <i>You</i> promise not to get upset at this. This arrangement of page and JDC knowledge exists in lieu of you knowing anything about Poland in 1796."<br/><br/>All three of those things work in concert. The page satisfies me that there is something about the setting that they'll know and they won't stumble over a prop while they're popping about the stage. The use of me as historical fact repository/decisionmaker eliminates endless attempts to remember something they saw on the Discovery Channel. And the intervention guarantees that the players won't concoct a plan involving something that won't be invented/developed/widespread for fifty years...  ("We'll catch him, we'll take the train!" "Um...no." ) ...while at the same time cautioning them not to leap right to the edge of the envelope of the setting and invest in a plan that might not be feasible in the setting, hopefully dampening disappointments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64609/#Comment_64609" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-21T01:28:36+00:00" title="April 21, 2007  1:28AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Could you remind us how Yet and Up worked?</blockquote>I wish I could. I've got a vague grasp of it at best, having only gotten second-hand info, mostly. Here's what little I can say with clarity... Up is chronological time (like going up the timeline) and Yet is your personal time (like "I have yet to do something"), right? But, sometimes, you know what's going to happen in your Yet. The game lets you make statements about what your future self did (hide a gun, write yourself a warning, whatever) -- this gives you some "frag" until you turn around and do the event.<br/><br/>So, err, if you're trying to get events to line up with some prewritten timeline in a historical game, you're basically doing something where the players know that they must do something in the future in order for events to work out -- on the metagame level, you're trying to minimize the "frag" that comes from not making things happen as they're supposed to.<br/><br/>That's all just talking out of my ass, of course. If I picked up a historical game, I'd probably either be going for the experience of a general period rather than specific events, or specifically for an "alternate history" kind of situation where I could change up something big and see where that led.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64610/#Comment_64610" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-21T02:16:29+00:00" title="April 21, 2007  2:16AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>So, like, the thing with historical games is that you can't do anything that would get written down in a history book, right?</p>\n<p>I think that if you kick that right down the trash chute, and say, "We're going to start here, but we're going to do this really balls-out and play like we mean it, and become the people in the history books of another world," it'd be billions better.</p>\n<p>Then you don't really need to know anything about what would have happened if you didn't interfere, because you <em>did.</em> And, presumably, you use some of the other good techniques in this thread to salve the crippling weight of setting so it doesn't break everyone.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64611/#Comment_64611" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-21T05:57:01+00:00" title="April 21, 2007  5:57AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's a dial the group needs to set, Shreyas - it can be fun to install a Moroccan pirate lady as Pope, but it can also be fun to skirt the edges of reality and create the <i>real </i>reason William McKinley was assassinated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64617/#Comment_64617" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-21T07:35:36+00:00" title="April 21, 2007  7:35AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>It's funny, I've definitely experienced the game being run by the guy who knows every nuance of the time and place and corrects people when they get it wrong.

I've had the same little voice in my head wittering away when running Cold City (ok, so not straight historical, but with a large historical element) saying things like "But the internment camps near Berlin were closed by this point!" and the realist in me going "Yeah, but this is a cool bit in the story, so who cares?".<br/><br/>I like history to be there as a reference point, but not as an anchor dragging you down.

At its heart, history is just another setting (at this point the part of me that is the ancient historian gets up and leaves in disgust), with all the problems and benefits that that entails. I don't think there's any real difference between a new player getting to grips with Waterdeep as there is to getting to grips with 4th Century London. Both can easily leave them feeling overwhelmed and horribly lost. The only real difference is that Waterdeep probably gets a nicer sourcebook :-D<br/><br/>Exactly, often in these discussions I see people getting hung up on really abstract issues that just aren't a problem in play (not here so much happily).  What if a character wants to become King?  What of it?  What if that happens in any other game?  Does it ever happen?  It's never come up in my games in around 25 years.  What if the characters want to assassinate Hitler?  Do they?  Is that what the game is about?  Is that something remotely likely to arise in game?  Oh no, the characters aren't presidents and kings, where's the protagonism?  Protagonism isn't about those things.  If the players want to be presidents and kings then play that game, but in the vast majority of games historical or otherwise the players aren't looking to be world leaders, they want to be the centre of their story quite rightly but that doesn't mean they always want to be the centre of the world's story (whatever that is).<br/><br/>There are real issues with historical gaming, but in these discussions I can usually tell who hasn't actually tried it because the issues they come up with tend not to be the real ones.  Real issues tend to be stuff like crappy travelling times, restrictions on weapons, more efficient law enforcement than most gamers are used to and above all else the absence of instahealing.  The history as metaplot issue comes up a lot in online discussions, but hardly ever in actual play.<br/><br/>It's just another setting, setting your game in 17th Century France is no different to setting it in Glorantha or a world you made up for your Charnel Gods game.  The problems are practical ones, not theoretical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64655/#Comment_64655" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-22T08:56:15+00:00" title="April 22, 2007  8:56AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There are real issues with historical gaming, but in these discussions I can usually tell who hasn't actually tried it because the issues they come up with tend not to be the real ones.

Yup, cut to the little aairplane travelling over the amp with the redline showing the route, just like in <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>. Done.<br/><br/>Restrictions on weapons, More efficient law enforcement: Simple common sense and a reference to whatever action movies you've seen. If your character is toting weaponry, chances are good that you are either sanctioned by your society to carry it, or your character has made the choice to deal with any negative consequences of using it. Easy. <br/><br/>Absence of instahealing: Either there's a more pulp vibe to it with a bunch more temporary ( bruising) type damage that characters shake off, or weapons become randomly deadly and actual hits rare ( because they are), and everyone(pcs+npcs) takes it into account.<br/><br/>I think you missed one Balbinus:<br/><br/>" I don't play historic rpgs because I want to play a [fill in ethnic group, gender, sexual orientation], and they can't be a [ societal position, educational background, whatever] in the setting"<br/><br/>Bull. Read a book folks!!!! Almost any period will have unique individuals busting out of societal strait-jacketing. I'm not talking about fictional characters ( although they're fun too) but honest-to-goodness actual people that lived through the period.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64656/#Comment_64656" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-22T09:18:46+00:00" title="April 22, 2007  9:18AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a lot of these problems with my Game Chef submission, <b>Bone White, Blood Red</b>.

In the Native American traditions, there is not a huge divide between "things that happened in the golden age of magic and mythology" and "things that happened last week." There is no rejection of the mythological happening on a daily basis, and I wanted my game about the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 to reflect that mindset.<br/><br/>Part of what we're dealing with is the post-Enlightenment worldview that history <em>isn't</em> mythological; that the Middle Ages did <em>not</em> have magic. This is surely all rational and good, but it is a modern invention, and for most of mankind's existence, magic and myths were real things that we did interact with, not just in fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64675/#Comment_64675" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-22T19:25:23+00:00" title="April 22, 2007  7:25PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kynn, <br/><br/>Well put. <br/><br/>Which always brings up the issue to me of "whose history are we playing here?" Because when I read about ancient Persia in an English history book and when I read about it in an Iranian tract the things they tell me may as well be about different universes. Not even the sky is the same color. <br/><br/>But that one gets settled the same way similar questions of non-historical settings get settled, as the many good folks of this thread have pointed out. <br/><br/>Really, I think the keyest issue to hammer out about what you need to make an historical game work is to answer the question of why you (your group) want to play an historical game. Do you want the grit of no healing? Do you want to deal directly with Hitler? Do you want to rub shoulders with the bold faced name NPCs from history books? Do you want to travel the silk road as an anonymous merchant? <br/><br/>I think the thing that kills history games for so many people happens around that -- they don't ever figure out why they actually want to play history, and this specific history, and wander in assuming that everyone is on the same page and in the same history and that is just always a train wreck. <br/><br/>(And yea, the same questions get asked about why you want to play in Glorantha, or Forgotten Realms. But at least they have books that are pretty canonical and designed directly for RPG play, so they tend to be slightly easier to cluster around at start up.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66038/#Comment_66038" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-29T20:44:32+00:00" title="April 29, 2007  8:44PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>I think the thing that kills history games for so many people happens around that -- they don't ever figure out why they actually want to play history, and this specific history, and wander in assuming that everyone is on the same page and in the same history and that is just always a train wreck.</blockquote>\nThat's really apt, I think.<br/><br/>I think my initial confusion/consternation with historical gaming is that there are many levels to it:<br/><br/>1) Playing out dudes in some era of history. Easy to do. Take out magic, turn on the learning and go.<br/>2) Playing out dudes who have an effect of history, like how things will happen. This is a little more complicated, because you have to establish if history can be changed or not, and perhaps sit down and agree to play out a tighter, more focused historical game.<br/>3) Playing out major dudes in history, focusing on famous or well-recorded historical events. Kinda strangling IMO, and for some reason this is the first place my mind starts to wander when I think of "Historical Roleplaying".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite><br/>I like gaming to be about human issues, and for that for me (and others will vary of course) I find it best to stick to the human.</blockquote>\nHey man, thanks for your comments. They've been really helpful.<br/><br/>Also, I guess my unasked question here is this: What's a good way to motivate the players to do a little bit of research (at least Wikipedia) into the historical period in question, before the game begins or even between-session?<br/><br/>Say that we're all fired up to start a game that takes place in medieval Korea or dark ages Poland or something. Everyone agrees to that setting, and is fired up about it... but no one knows a lot about the setting, including the GM (me). The players treat the game as a game, show up, but have a hard time in-session coming up with their own actions since they're just not that knowledgeable about the setting.  Frex, if I was a player in a feudal Japanese game, I know what a festival looks like and what there is to do, or what a tavern is like and what there is to eat and drink. So I can really be proactive and have my character in there doing stuff.<br/><br/>What I find is that, unless the players are familiar with the setting, it's hard for them to take initiative and author stuff for their character. They tend to get reactive, waiting for me to introduce the Thing to Do at the Festival, or to force them into a Tavern. I'm looking for ways to encourage the players to research a little themselves, without it feeling like homework, and without diminishing their overall initial excitement of playing in that setting.  <br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66043/#Comment_66043" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-29T21:45:07+00:00" title="April 29, 2007  9:45PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, this question actually inspired a little side project for me, so here's a bit of what I'm working on.<br/><br/>Take a counter-intuitive approach.<br/><br/>Usually with a setting, there's the urge to hit the player with lots of info, and fairly complete info at that.<br/><br/>Instead, give them short bits of info with key words on multiple topics related to the setting. One form might be a sheet with ten to twelve single sentences containing info. Decide on what info goes on each sheet all William S. Burroughs style. Cut the sentences in strips, mix-em-up and draw them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, just write them on 3" x 5" cards and save yourself the hassle.<br/><br/>Deal them out randomly, along with either a brief verbal or written background. Brief, like two paragraphs.<br/><br/>The idea here is to criss-cross player info. No single player needs to have all of the info, as they will support one another's understand to build up a picture of the setting. It does mean allowing either discussion time or in-game pauses to relay info. OTOH, they could play a bit in-character- " No! Don't offer Saladin the porkchops, dumbass!"<br/><br/>Anyway, that's what I've got for an idea, Andy.<br/><br/>As for encouraging a bit of research, allow those interested to add their own data cards and deal them out as the game progresses. It might be a good indication of what parts of a setting are revving up the players' interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66050/#Comment_66050" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-29T23:18:51+00:00" title="April 29, 2007 11:18PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, the "play an important historical figure" is a huge part of educational roleplaying and has been for years.

You need a way to break through cluelessness syndrome, But I don't think homework is it. Like for medieval Korea, I think you can just say to your players, "So dudes, this is kind of like medieval Japan, only it's colder and you live closer to northern China, with all the consequences that that implies.

It might, for instance, be interesting to explore the realities of caveman culture where survival is constantly threatened by wild animals and food is difficult to come by (not really a universal or contemporary problem). Likewise, a game which really gets into the nitty gritty of Japanese Feudal culture and the demands of a strict honor-based society (this gets pretty close to contemporary or unversal issues, but I still think that it is distinct).<br/><br/>Personally, I agree with your statement though. I always take the Terry Pratchett approach to setting - no matter where or when you are, people and their concerns are pretty much the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66167/#Comment_66167" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T10:21:43+00:00" title="April 30, 2007 10:21AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Except I think that even in your examples, you're still exploring not actually how cavemen survived or how Japanese feudal systems worked, but rather how the players, sitting around in the 21st century, view those issues brought up by the game.<br/><br/>Me roleplaying a caveman is not about what cavemen do.

Is it even a worthwhile goal? <br/><br/>I mean, Love and Marriage is going to mean very different things to an Ancient Greek or a feudal samurai... but we come at it from an "enlightened" modern viewpoint by default. Likewise, studying ancient cultures you see a group of people make decisions, based on their understanding of the world or their culture, which strike a modern observer as instantly "wrong". Playing an ancient character as a modern person (with our level of tactical thinking and philisophical viewpoints) who happens to be running around in Kyoto or Greece does not do adequate service to the culture that you are working to emulate... and that might (or might not) be an important distinction between 'history as setting' and 'history emulation'.<br/><br/>Granted, we will always be "people sitting around a table" <i>pretending</i> to deal with their problems... so there will always be a huge disconnect.<br/><br/>*shrug*\n<blockquote><br/>I could envision a really good "caveman" game that is really about the American reaction to 9/11 and the resulting war on terror and increased paranoia and fear of "the other."<br/></blockquote>\nThat would be a very interesting game (and one that I would be happy to play in) <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66181/#Comment_66181" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T11:34:14+00:00" title="April 30, 2007 11:34AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DirkGently</cite><br/><br/>I could envision a really good "caveman" game that is really about the American reaction to 9/11 and the resulting war on terror and increased paranoia and fear of "the other."<br/></blockquote>\nThat would be a very interesting game (and one that I would be happy to play in) <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>You and me both!
