Let's say I don't have design skills available to me. And let's say I find attractive the idea of getting this into a nice looking physical copy for myself, or maybe a few for my group, or even hold open the option for an interested gamer in Bolivia to get their hands on the self-same.<br/>\nThoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155798/#Comment_155798" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T08:51:12+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  8:51AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, there are some things good about Blurb.  Lulu only offers hardcovers in limited sizes, so if you're going more for that hardcover portfolio or coffee table book, it might make sense.  Also, from their promo stuff, it looks like Blurb may print at a higher picture quality than Lulu, but I'd have to compare them to make sure. Definitely not a very cheap route, though. Honestly, it looks like they're trying to compete with print services like <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/printproducts.html" rel="nofollow">Apple's photo books</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
