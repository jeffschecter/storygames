<p>Every so often, a sword is forged with nobility folded into its blade. It fights like a king. It's brighter than a stream of flowing water. It is passed down for generations, it becomes battle-hardened and wise.</p>
<p>Sometimes one of these weapons dies in battle, but death is not the end.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it does not want to quit the battlefield, and then it becomes (??? word needed here; meaning 'ghost of a sword'). Then, the fmily joins an elite order of warriors who use the unearthly magic of their ghost swords to keep peace in the world.</p>
<p>That's a game concept I'm putting together, and I need some terms, particularly the one for the sword ghost. It's sort of a Bleach/Jedi mashup.</p>

                            Some ideas...<br/><br/>These three all basically mean "Ghost Sword"...<br/>Reikenã€€ã€ŒéœŠå‰£ã€ <br/>Yuukenã€€ã€Œå¹½å‰£ã€<br/>Yuureikenã€€ã€Œå¹½éœŠå‰£ã€<br/><br/>This one is more like "Underworld Sword" or "Hades Blade"...<br/>Meiken ã€Œå†¥å‰£ã€<br/><br/>You could also replace the "-ken" å‰£ in any of the above with "-to" åˆ€ if you want to invoke a more specific "Japanese Katana" feel.<br/><br/>They aren't real Japanese words you can look up in a dictionary, but the character compounds would probably make sense to a Japanese reader.<br/><br/>I was also going to suggest the longer (and more archaic sounding) é»„æ³‰é‚„ã‚Šã®å‰£ "Yomigaeri no Tsurugi", which would roughly translate to "Sword which has returned from the underworld". This also has some old-school Japanese wordplay since yomigaeri can also be read as "resurrection" if you use different kanji.  Unfortunately a little Googling shows that someone beat me to the punch with this pun as there is already a novel which incorporates it in <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%BB%84%E6%B3%89%E3%81%8C%E3%81%88%E3%82%8A" rel="nofollow">the title</a>.  You could probably still use it without people crying foul, unless you have a lot of Japanese horror novel fans reading your work.<br/><br/>Anyhow, good luck with your project.  Neat idea!<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Colin                        </div>

                            I am here to say two things:<br/><br/>1. This game idea is so fine, it's so fine it blows my mind.<br/>2. "Yomigaeri no Tsurugi" is AWESOME. But "Reiken" or "Reito" are both punchier. Maybe one is the game title and one is the practical name of the ghost swords.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JonathanWalton</cite><br/>Do they not use é¬¼ or ç²¾ for 'ghost' in kanji?</blockquote>
They do, although not as often as the å¹½éœŠ compound. é¬¼ is usually used to indicate devils or demons (or malevolent spirits), while ç²¾ by itself simply means "fine" or "precise" although it does appear in ç²¾éœŠ which tends to imply animistic spirits like mountain or tree spirits. 
<blockquote>What about "the resurrected blade"?  Something like å¤æ´»åˆ€?</blockquote>
How would you romanize/anglicize that from the Chinese?  In Japanese it would be Fukkatsu-to.                        </div>

You're pretty much spot on.  I envy people who can read Chinese.  They have to know so many more kanji than Japanese readers do ^-^;<br/><br/>é»„æ³‰ is Yomi, one of the names of the underworld. é‚„ã‚Š is kaeri, a truncated form of the verb kae-ru "to return".  In this case I used a slightly less common kanji, although the meaning is basically the same.  I chose it because I had seen it in the Japanese translation of "Return of the King" çŽ‹ã®å¸°é‚„ and it looked cool.  The ã® in this case is not possessive, I'm not sure of the grammatical term, but "Aã®B" can mean "B which has A".  ã® is sometimes written ä¹‹ in some texts, which as I recall has some grammatical meaning in Chinese (don't quote me on that, though).                        </div>

<p>Man, <em>yomigaeri no tsurugi</em>... that is a beautiful phrase. Thanks, Colin! That'll make a great title.</p>
<p>I think I'll go with reiken for the shortened term, 'cause it sounds good in <em>reikendo.</em></p>
<p>I'll probably bump this thread later when I have some more solid ideas about the nature of the sword ghost, and what kind of opposition the characters are actually facing. Ideas about those are welcome, as well.</p>

<i>Reikendo</i>. Holy crap yes.<br/><br/>This just popped into my head: What if the Reikendo-ka can use his Ghost Sword to battle demons in the spirit world so his little sister won't want to hurt herself anymore? What if he can kill a man's thirst for the bottle? What if his blade is so sharp it can cut hunger from the world?                        </div>

In modern standard pronunciation, Fuhuo Dao.<br/><br/>The character  ã‚Š is not kanji, so it was the only one I couldn't read.  I know that ã® is ä¹‹ (the possessive, but also used to attach adjectives to nouns in classical), so I can read çŽ‹ã®å¸°é‚„ no problem, "king's return."  We use the ç²¾çµ compound in modern Chinese too (that second character is the simplified version of your éœŠ), mostly for spirits, lesser demons, and 'goblins.'  å¹½çµ has mostly dropped out of style, though video games and other pop Western media are bringing many of the obscure words for monsters back into use.  There are also some new ones like å¸è¡€é¬¼ 'blood drinking demon' for "vampire."                        </div>

I'm going to stick my neck out and say Sorcerer (It's obligatory that we suggest it anyway ^-^;)<br/><br/>Treat the swords as demons.  If they were forged a long time ago they probably have old-school ideas and needs that would clash well with the characters trying to do right...<br/><br/>"So these two people have gone against the wishes of their families and become lovers?  What do you mean we should <i>talk it out</i>, the shame they have brought on their families can only be washed clean with their blood.  Let us slay them now, I will guide your hand!"<br/><br/>But I'm sure there are other options.  Game design isn't really my strong point ^-^;<br/><br/>P.S.  I'm really honored that you're using my idea as the title.  Best of luck!                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite>I just wanted to mention that Bleach is fantastically awesome...</blockquote>
...for about the first 8-12 episode or so, then bleeeeehhhhhhhh (IMO of course).<br/><br/>What I had problems with was all the enormous awesome conflict, setup, ideas, characters set up in the first part of the series... only to get discarded as the thing turns into Dragonball Z swordfights.<br/><br/>Which, incidentally, is why I'm 100% behind Shreyas' ideas to mine all the awesome stuff out of Bleach and turn it into a kickass gaming campaign. I'd love to see notes as this game develops/is played.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>Some more thoughts...just sort of disorganised design journal stuff.</p>
<p>The reiken tends to absorb and exaggerate the traits of its master. It makes them aggressive and imbues them with spiritual force. These traits linger after the master is gone; a player in this game may play a series of characters who keep inheriting a reiken from each other, as the earlier characters die in battle or retire.</p>
<p>Reikendoka are instantly recognizeable as such. I think they might wear distinctive white kimono - white for funeral garb.</p>
<p>Similarly, the restless dead (need a word here) and the demons of peoples' hearts (another word) are also instantly recognizeable. I have this idea that, with reikendo, one can actually enter a spiritual landscape <em>inside a person</em> and confront that person as a small population of people and spirits in conflict with one another. Maybe heart demons are like Final Fantasy monsters, sort of ornate and brightly painted like Southeast Asian statues come to life, all covered in ornamental appendages and extremities in unlikely places.</p>
<p>It's probably possible for a heart demon to possess a person completely - this is the state that describes extreme eating disorders, alcoholism, debilitating physical conditions, and so on. I don't say 'causes' because that's not the case. Heart demon is not the best term; I mean it to be, like, a cancerous organ of the human spirit. Hm, so, I guess the restless dead are spirits who have succumbed to the cancer near-completely.</p>
<p>For correct pacing there needs to be a system reason that low-conflict "regular life" interludes occur. For other pacing reasons, there needs to be some conflict arc structure that encourages players to leave story arcs unresolved, monitors unresolved arcs, and thrusts them back into the forefront at irregular intervals.</p>

                            Shreyas, that makes me think of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_19th" rel="nofollow">Alice 19th</a></i>. Which is remarkably fun and is a lot less testosterone-y than <i>Bleach</i>. (Which I enjoyed a bunch right up through around ep. 60 of the anime or so, but you have to like over-the-top drawn-put battle episodes. It does start to drag a LOT after they return to the regular world).                        </div>

                            First system suggestion: Polaris? A Mistaken-like role can mold how the protagonist and the sword shape each other, and you can alter the Zeal/Weariness scale to provide some pacing perhaps.<br/><br/>Second suggestion: cut of chunks of DitV/tPK to fit. If you like the kind of exchanges that the system produces (bringing in traits through the conflict, making asserts back and forth until on side can't afford to persist), then it's worthwhile to try it out. Here's the relevant pieces of the system:<br/><br/>- Stats: DitV uses different stats (base dice for a conflict) to encourage escalation between different arenas of conflict; tPK ignores this entirely.<br/><br/>- Gear: Dangerous weapons (guns in DitV, swords in tPK) have an extra d4 attached, implying that their use necessarily complicates a situation.<br/><br/>- Relationships: You can rate a relationship like any trait (XdY), and these only come up in situations where the relationship is in play or threatened. (It's not a freeform trait you can just bring in.) What's interesting is the way Sorcery in DitV works: you take relationships to a demon. When you actually call on demonic power (say the relationship is 5d4), your roll Xd10 (so 5d10) for what you're doing.<br/><br/>- Traits: Rated XdY, brought into conflicts, earned through fallout in conflicts (and normal game progress). What might be interesting is giving traits to the sword, not just the player, and make moving some traits from the player onto the sword part of fallout - in this way, the sword can accrete more personality.                        </div>

<p>The more I think about it, the more I am resistant to using Dogs as anything more than inspiration for situation building. I don't feel like the fallout ...thing... is right, and it is devoid of the pacing tools that I want.</p>
<p>Also, I didn't mention this before, but I really want a system that is very robust for an unstable player group, which means that even if it divides up responsibilities tyranically, this division must by fluid and systematically regulated.</p>

Or you could have one of the other players (the player opposite, next to you?) could <i>play </i>the sword itself. One of the entries in the Reversed Engineer challenge, Utopolis, did something similar, but with robot sidekicks. Or is that what you meant Dev?                        </div>

<p>So, here are some thoughts on a situation generator:</p>
<p>The first step is, "a relationship goes wrong." This proceeds through several stages, with "somebody dies" in there somewhere, and ends in "the deceased becomes a restless ghost," and "the ghost goes mad and starts being destructive".</p>
<p>When a swordsman accepts a commission, he recieves a trait (let's call it the promise) that is attached to that commission. Each time he uses it in a conflict, it gets bigger. He can even use it in conflicts related to other commissions.</p>
<p>The descriptive effect of using this promise is that we learn something about the origins of that relationship's breakdown, and if it crosses into another commission, it links their causes together. So, like, maybe the shut-in who's trapped in his house by the ghost of an overprotective brother and the soccer player who is supernaturally unsuccessful in love can both trace their terrible destinies back to one day, when a post-semifinals party went slightly wrong...</p>
<p>And following these breakdowns eventually leads to demons of the human heart, who are sort of like 'level bosses' in a video game sense - they are scaled based on the amount of commissions and promises that led up to them, and they appear only periodically, as a special and ricky challenge. Once a group of commissions leads to a demon and that demon is dealt with, those commissions are completed and the promise is removed from the character sheet, or maybe it turns into some other thing.</p>
