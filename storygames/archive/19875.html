I only have 5 minutes or so for this, so it would only be the briefest of overviews, but it's something I'd like to include nevertheless.<br/><br/>Does anyone know of similar summaries that have already been published or could advise useful blogs to visit?<br/><br/>When I mean general trends I mean either trends in game mechanics (e.g. we are approaching an Apocalypse World singularity where every new game traces its lineage back to it somehow) or in how we're coming together to play games (e.g. life's too hard to schedule so we only play 2 player games now).<br/><br/>I'd also like to put together a list (however rough) of indie/story games released in 2014. Again, does anyone know if this has already been done or good places to start?<br/><br/>Cheers!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440141/#Comment_440141" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-16T08:30:46+00:00" title="November 16, 2014  8:30AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PbtA is a great place to start hacking but I feel we are moving out of the AW singularity, not into it.

I think we're seeing a lot less direct hacks of the game that try to use the same exact frame, but I also think that a lot of the language of AW is finding itself integrated into even unrelated projects - namely, clearly stated fictional triggers and encoded Principles of play that are treated as rules rather than advice. These ideas weren't unique or invented by PbtA, but are hallmarks of the system that I think we're seeing show up in other games even as we move away from straight hacks.<br/>This thread might not be the best place for further discussion of that, but I wanted to bring up a different side. I totally agree with the rest of his observations.<br/><br/>I know that I've seen a bit of a push for games that can be played in a smaller amount of time than a standard 3/4 hour session, from Lady Windimere's Fan in minutes to 2-hour games.<br/><br/>There were a couple surges from contests like Game Chef and Golden Cobra too, bringing in unconventional presentations of games and more freeform stuff. Whether this stuff counts depends on your definition of "released."<br/><br/>As for a list of stuff from 2014, that's really hard. Do you count a released public beta as a release? Simple posted game stuff that's complete, like Tod's Being Eero thing here? Only games officially published through avenues like DrivethruRPG or the like?<br/>Good starting points would be DriveThruRPG, or perhaps looking through the successful 2013 RPG Kickstarters and seeing what's been delivered in 2014.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440149/#Comment_440149" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-16T10:44:24+00:00" title="November 16, 2014 10:44AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2014 10:44AM by AsIf.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i><a href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">@horn_head_o</a> - Point taken re initial hacks versus second-gen influences.

It was a 2011 release, but we switched to selling PDFs ourselves (before we had another company managing the PDF sales) and as a result had to upload all of our books again so it looks like they all came out this year.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440225/#Comment_440225" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-20T02:34:14+00:00" title="November 20, 2014  2:34AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're listing Free vs PWYW you might also want to include The Ransom Model.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440234/#Comment_440234" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-20T05:03:12+00:00" title="November 20, 2014  5:03AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2014 5:11AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe <b>long-cons</b> grew and <b>American LARPing</b> continued to diverge from Jeep.<br/><br/><b>Kickstarting</b> isn't new to 2014, but most of the other list items aren't either, so I'd include it as a current trend.<br/><br/>I have a vague sense of <b>large, commercially successful games or creators adopting more indie techniques</b>.  <i>13th Age</i>'s non-numeric backgrounds and relationships and <i>D&amp;D 5</i>'s inspiration points are pretty hippie, while ex-White Wolfer Will Hindmarch used the <i>Lady Blackbird</i> resolution system for his classic cyberpunk scenario game <i>Always/Never/Now</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440235/#Comment_440235" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-20T05:10:20+00:00" title="November 20, 2014  5:10AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Business<br/>-\tImpact of Patreon<br/>-\tMusic for RPGs<br/>-\tFree vs PWYW</blockquote>There has been occasional talk of pairing games with music for decades;

What I meant was that Americans who loved doing Jeep unaltered in 2009-2012 have been altering it more in the past two years.  I'm thinking specifically of <a href="/forums/profile/jenskot">@jenskot</a> &amp; Terry's X-Men and mystical high school reunion LARPs, but I vaguely recall others passing through the con scene too.<br/><br/>So, uh... "American indie LARPs"?

And sure, large-press games have occasionally worked in stuff from small-press games throughout gaming history.  But D&amp;D5 Inspiration feels a little different to me.  Feels like more of a change, to a bigger game, than most past examples I can think of.  Maybe that's not noteworthy, or maybe it is...

I don't know if it will catch on as a term or not but it is definitely a thing.<br/><br/>Long cons seem to be happening with more or less success at larger regional cons (again, in North America). Outside that context I don't see them going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440621/#Comment_440621" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-03T20:26:53+00:00" title="December  3, 2014  8:26PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;Schoolgirl RPG (Maid offshoot)<br/>Thanks for reminding, need to get it / play it                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
