The discussion quickly established that, no, there isn't and a lot of folks (myself included) think there should be. Discussion then turned to what form such a thing should take, the implications of such and how it would relate to the broader hobby. Eventually I stated that the discussion had expanded beyond the scope of my original question and begged off some time to organize my response. Well, I finally got around to it, so here it is.<br/><br/><b>What I am Proposing</b><br/><br/>I believe that its high time that the field of story-gaming was made accessible, available and appealing to as wide an array of people as possible. I'd personally would love to see it become an endevour engaged in by a spectrum of people as diverse as middle-American housewives, Korean film students and pre-teen summer-campers , a form of artistic expression with, if not mass appeal, at least easy acceptance. In the short term and more practically, I think real effort needs to be put into blowing away the wall of arcane babble which renders it confusing even to many of its current aficionados.<br/><br/>As per the original discussion, I agree that two separate but related efforts should be made. First, a general \xe2\u20ac\u0153Story Game Basic\xe2\u20ac\x9d needs to be written that serves as an able introduction to the hobby, one that presents core usable concepts in non-technical terms which most anyone will be able to read and understand. The goal is not to cover all possible permutations of story-gaming, but just to give a workable foundation. I've started work on something like this myself, but by no means do I claim exclusivity. However, for such a thing to achieve its goal, it'll need promotion...which is an issue that needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>Second, an online resource needs to be created to facilitate further exploration of the subject easily. A one page, friendly \xe2\u20ac\u0153Start Here\xe2\u20ac\x9d FAQ, jargon free and with an easy to reference web address (like \xe2\u20ac\u0153starthere.com\xe2\u20ac\x9d as opposed to \xe2\u20ac\u0153www.story-games.com/index/starthere/faqpage377642\xe2\u20ac\x9d), linking to newbie-friendly discussion site was suggested and seems good to me. Basically, a place were those of dawning interest can go without being overwhelmed by the glowering mass of the Forge. Good work to that end has already been started on this website.<br/><br/>Originally it was also proposed by several folks that a means of making story-games appealing to traditional RPG'ers should also be presented, but for reasons I state below this is not of personal interest to me.<br/><br/>Many further particulars of <i>how</i> all this will all be achieved has yet to be determined. <br/><br/><b>Why I Think It Should Be Done</b><br/><br/>Bluntly, I think the current state of this hobby is ridiculous. The still nascent story-game community is, in my opinion, suffering from a strongly insular attitude, a cliquish mindset that, at its worst, disdains people who aren't already in the know. More than one person in the discussion that preceded this one conveyed such an attitude either obliquely or directly. <br/><br/>On mere philosophical grounds alone I find this distasteful enough, but there are practical ramifications as well. The indie game field is, I think, starting to suffer from practical stagnation, over-specialization and creative inversion. As a friend/occasional enemy of mine quipped, \xe2\u20ac\u0153they're all aspiring game-artists, too busy writing blogs and games to play, selling to other aspiring game-artists looking for funky rules to write into their own blogs and games.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Stated more politely, as far as I can tell nearly all of the indie-game movement's efforts are being directed towards theory and design with at best token energy being spent on reaching the existing indie and story game audience, and none on expansion. If that state endures the audience and market will shrink, and nobody will be around to pay you to write game books anymore. <br/><br/>And of course, the more people that have been exposed to the medium, the easier time I'll have getting players for <i>my</i> games.<br/><br/><b>Why I'm discussing this on the Story-Games fora</b><br/><br/>Obviously, at least in part because I like the term \xe2\u20ac\u0153Story-Game\xe2\u20ac\x9d. More broadly, because of all the online hobby game communities I think, with its focus on practical utility, it is the community most open to the idea and the one most likely to do constructive things with it.<br/><br/><b>My Underlying Assumptions</b><br/><br/>I think the effort is worthwhile for its own sake. I also think it is easily feasible. If I, with no sort of formal technical computer background and largely through access to helpful online communities, was able to get enough of a working knowledge of Linux to comfortably use it as my default operating system, I don't see any reason why <i>this</i> community can't get its act together enough to clearly explain what a \xe2\u20ac\u0153R-map\xe2\u20ac\x9d is when someone asks.<br/><br/>I have one huge prejudice that colors my expectations and approach to this, so I better state it forthrightly: I prefer story-gaming as a hobby of interested amateurs taking a DIY approach to things rather than a field of semi-pro designers building up a consumer market. Open-source, information should be free and all that other hippie-commie blather. So I'm not too big on questions about how to make money off the thing, though I do understand it as a useful motive.<br/><br/>Finally, but significantly, I think it is time to recognize that story-gaming is a related but distinct medium from traditional role-playing games and, as it were, cut the apron strings. For the purpose of bringing in new players, it is no longer desirable to make a point of the line of progression from <i>D&amp;D</i> to <i>Prime Time Adventures</i>, and such may actually be a hindrance. With that in mind, I don't think \xe2\u20ac\u0153converting\xe2\u20ac\x9d existing traditional gamers is a priority. I think any who would be interested have come over by now, and effort would be better spent elsewhere.<br/><br/>Well, there you go. Now you can start tearing it apart.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81373/#Comment_81373" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-15T21:24:42+00:00" title="July 15, 2007  9:24PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I'm right behind you.

If there was a good Law &amp; Order/CSI/Sopranos-style RPG, though, they'd have been all over it.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is a critical thing to realize, that those people are out there, we just haven't done a very good job of reaching them. I think we all know folks who would have been engaged up until their eyes glazed at the phrase \xe2\u20ac\u0153...its like D&amp;D.\xe2\u20ac\x9d \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vertigo25</cite><br/>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think what you're looking for is ubiquity; not so much that you're looking for a good game to start newcomers off with. The reason I say is this is because, although <i>D&amp;D</i> was my first game, it was so because of name recognition and an interest in fantasy.</blockquote>\nThis is an excellent point, and I kept it foremost in mind when writing out my proposal. Fortunately, th internet now makes ubiquity achievable without multi-million copy distribution.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br/>The Pool is the game you're looking for...[it] fits all of your requirements, can fit into 1 sheet of paper, and is free...[The] game which will introduce players of traditional games into story games ideas... already exists. It's called The Pool.</blockquote>\nGah. Okay, I concede that The Pool is a great, simple yet dynamic design. In fact after having been exposed to it here on SG, I'm working to expand it into the very Story Game Basic I propose. But as it exists right now it is useless as an intro game because only a small cadre of existing enthusiasts know about it and no form of promotion exists for it. Implying that no SG-Basic need be done because The Pool exists is sort of like saying that all those scientists researching the cure for cancer are just wasting their time, given that if they just bothered to look in that hidden time-locked vault in the Pentagon they'd have it in a jiffy.   \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelson</cite><br/>My original intent with Microcosm (which is very much an introductory thing) was to make the existing file the first part of a longer document. The second part was going to all be "options", at one option per page, adding details like character traits, dice, flags, keys, anything and everything I thought I could make fit with the existing stuff. Kind of an "expand this game the way you want" kit.</blockquote>\nOoh, useful. Levi, I think I'll be borrowing a lot of your explication from Microcosm in my Pool expansion.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: T-Boy</cite><br/>-I am aware of the existence of dozens of blogs about the subject. That's not the problem; the problem is, basically, that while all the information is there, I have no idea where I should begin. The main issue seems to be the fact that, apart from a few fragmentary Wikipedia articles, there is no primer.<br/>-I can, eventually, purchase the recommended game titles and go through them. The problem lies in the fact that this will take time and money, which is in short supply.<br/>-I am not aware of any role-playing game conventions in the entire region where I live, much less in the country where I live (that's South East Asia and Malaysia, respectively). And even then, most of them, I suspect, will focus on old-school RPGs.<br/>-Yes, you're all talking shop.

I think a 'pitch' for RPG virgins is different than one to "traditional RPG" players. Even though both groups are new to story games, they come from different contexts. In particular, traditional RPG players have been playing RPGs and using dice and jargon. Pitching to them should leverage the language and knowledge of <i>their</i> context, to avoid confusion and being dismissed for weird or "wrong" rules.<br/><br/>I'm no marketer, but I've been starting to brainstorm how Al Ries and Jack Trout's  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_%28marketing%29" rel="nofollow">Positioning</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_warfare_strategies" rel="nofollow">"Marketing Warfare"</a> strategies might relate to pitching and positioning story games. One of my favorite marketing tactics of theirs is to identify your competitor's strength and reposition it as a weakness. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Who are story games' competitors? These consumers seem like good candidates for potential story game buyers.\n<ul>\n<li>Traditional role-playing games<br/></li><li>Games of the non-role-playing variety<br/></li><li>Non-games, like TV, movies, and books<br/></li><li>Computer games?<br/></li></ul>\nI think the biggest pool of potential buyers are the Buffy/Firefly/Lost/Heroes TV fans. They are inspired by their TV shows' setting, but are passive participants. Position story games as a fun, social way to create their "living fanfic". Considering the sheer numbers of TV viewers and the fanfic many already write (without having been tainted by bad D&amp;D experiences), this is a ripe opportunity. Another Ries and Trout positioning tactic is to sell your product where your potential customers shop, not where your existing competitors sell! Imagine if PTA was sold on bookshelves besides Buffy/Firefly/Lost/Heroes books or DVDs, instead of on the bottom shelf of the bookstore's D&amp;D corner.<br/><br/>I think the second pool of potential buyers are traditional role-playing gamers who want more story. How do you identify these players? I imagine World of Darkness players would be more open to story games than D&amp;D 3.5E gamers.<br/><br/>Does one pitch them story game <i>accessories</i> to mod their existing game of choice, allowing them to preserve their time and money investment? Or do you pitch them story game stepping stones to their own games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81389/#Comment_81389" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-16T01:25:20+00:00" title="July 16, 2007  1:25AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2007 1:27AM by jake richmond.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I believe that its high time that the field of story-gaming was made accessible, available and appealing to as wide an array of people as possible. I'd personally would love to see it become an endevour engaged in by a spectrum of people as diverse as middle-American housewives, Korean film students and pre-teen summer-campers , a form of artistic expression with, if not mass appeal, at least easy acceptance. In the short term and more practically, I think real effort needs to be but into blowing away the wall of arcane babble which renders it confusing even to many of its current aficionados.</blockquote>\nI agree with this 100%. There is value and worth in moving story games forward and trying to find wider audiences. While I know this isn't going to be a really important goal for everyone here, I personally think it's very important...\n<blockquote>First, a general \xe2\u20ac\u0153Story Game Basic\xe2\u20ac\x9d needs to be written that serves as an able introduction to the hobby, one that presents core usable concepts in non-technical terms which most anyone will be able to read and understand. The goal is not to cover all possible permutations of story-gaming, but just to give a workable foundation.</blockquote>\nBut I have to completely disagree with this. These games we are making are becoming less and less similar all the time. Trying to create an introductory game can do nothing but introduce your audience to a "certain type" of Story Game, while ignoring others. There is no "workable foundation" that covers most Story Games (although certainly you could hope to cover some). I suspect that what you want this project to be is a good introductory game. Something that anyone can pick up, play and enjoy with minimal effort. That's a good goal. Calling it a game that anyone can try with very little initial investment is a good and exciting idea. Calling it a "Story Games Basic Set" is, I think, a very bad idea.<br/><br/>Perhaps something we should all be doing is trying to write games that are easier to buy into? As you suggest, games with less jargon. Games that are easy to read and understand, require less of a commitment of time to learn and play and are about things that actually interest a wider variety of people? There are certainly games that are moving this way. Breaking the Ice is my favorite example. Matt and I tried to do this with Panty Explosion. It's a fairly simple game that can be learned quickly, is portable and easy to play, can be enjoyed in just a few hours of a single evening is targeted at anime fans, manga readers and teenage girls and is written as plainly as possible. In hindsight, I'd very much like to streamline the game more, make it even easier to understand and quicker to learn. i think these are all worthwhile goals.<br/>\n<blockquote>Second, an online resource needs to be created to facilitate further exploration of the subject easily. A one page, friendly \xe2\u20ac\u0153Start Here\xe2\u20ac\x9d FAQ, jargon free and with an easy to reference web address (like \xe2\u20ac\u0153starthere.com\xe2\u20ac\x9d as opposed to \xe2\u20ac\u0153www.story-games.com/index/starthere/faqpage377642\xe2\u20ac\x9d), linking to newbie-friendly discussion site was suggested and seems good to me. Basically, a place were those of dawning interest can go without being overwhelmed by the glowering mass of the Forge. Good work to that end has already been started on this website.</blockquote>\nThis seems like a very good idea. I would add to this a searchable index of games. If I could type in "romantic comedy" or "pirates" or "spy drama" and get back a short list of games for each reasult, I think that would be very valuable.<br/><br/>(more below)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81390/#Comment_81390" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-16T01:25:46+00:00" title="July 16, 2007  1:25AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2007 1:28AM by jake richmond.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Bluntly, I think the current state of this hobby is ridiculous. The still nascent story-game community is, in my opinion, suffering from a strongly insular attitude, a cliquish mindset that, at its worst, disdains people who aren't already in the know. More than one person in the discussion that preceded this one conveyed such an attitude either obliquely or directly.</blockquote>\nI think this is somewhat true. This attitude (which for the most part I think is unitentional and as much a result of people on the outside as people on the inside) is harmful.  I also think that there are tons and tons of potential customers who have never heard of "Story Games", this forum or the Forge and would very much like to buy these games. I meet and talk to people every week who find Panty Explosion in thier local library, comic shop, anime store or record shop who have bought and enjoyed the game. Often these are people who have never palyed RPGs before, haven't played them for years, or tried them and never came back because while they liked the experience, they didn't care for the subject matter. As far as I can tell, most of the people we sell PE to are not "indie gamers" or "story gamers". They arn't part of this community. They don't even know this community exsists. To me, it doesn't really matter to much what this community does because the people I'm trying to sell to don't (for the most part) realize that this community exsists. When they find Panty Explosion, they don't find a story game, and indie game or a forge game. They just find the game that they've been wanting to play.\n<blockquote>The indie game field is, I think, starting to suffer from practical stagnation, over-specialization and creative inversion.</blockquote>\nStagnation and creative inversion are both dangers, although one might see both in a game where someone else finds neither. I don't think over-specialization is possible. It seems like specialization is important to reach a wider and more diverse audience. You can't hope to create a game that will appeal to everyone.Better, I think, to create a game focused at a certain audience.\n<blockquote>nearly all of the indie-game movement's efforts are being directed towards theory and design with at best token energy being spent on reaching the existing indie and story game audience, and none on expansion.</blockquote>\nThis may be true of some parts of the community (and this certainly isn't a bad thing in and of itself), but it certainly isn't true for everyone.I know several people who are making real efforts (and seeing some success) in finding new audiences and new customers for their games. It is true that as a community we are still very focused on selling our games in the traditional RPG market. I think this is a mistake for many of us. While some of us can find a home in that market, I think for many of our games it is very obvious that that market, that audience, does not want us. Is not interested in us. Better to market a game like Panty Explosion to anime and manga fans who are interested in the subject matter then gamers who are not. Certainly there is cross over, but the more mainstream anime/maga audience is so much bigger then the tiny (by comparrison) RPG audience. And that's just using PE as an example. What about games with subject matter that has true mainstream appeal, like Breaking the Ice (dating and romance)? What about games that have a huge potential niche audience, like carry (Vietnam War), 1001 Nights (Arabian Nights inspired storytelling), Contenders (boxing fans), Classroom Deathmatch (anyone who ever watched or read Battle Royale), The Shab-al-Hiri Roach (Lovecraftian horror),  or any number of other games. I think you agree that there are huge potential audiences for each of these games (huge compared to what we reach now). Saying that no effort is being put toward expanision is just not true. I do agree that more effort should be put toward expansion.\n<blockquote>And of course, the more people that have been exposed to the medium, the easier time I'll have getting players for my games.</blockquote>\nI wonder. I think this is true to some extent. More people buying and playing Story Games means more potential customers. It's also possible that someone could buy and love a certain game and never think to buy another game ever again. When I used to run a board game store I would see people come in and buy 1 game, and then never come back. Sometimes I'd run into these people months or years later (I just ran into one a few days ago actually) and they would tell me how much they love the game they bought and how they play it all the time. I'd often suggest that they come back and buy another game. Very often they would say that they already had the game they wanted, and didn't see a reason to own another. I think this is a pretty common thing among the "mainstream audience". I think that as we expand we'll see a good deal of people who enjoy one game, and come back for others. I think we'll also see a lot of people who buy the one game that interests them and never come back for more. And there's nothing wrong with that, I guess.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think this is an interesting effort.

The first one occurs in the "If You've Never Roleplayed Before" section. <br/><br/>I've had the same experience with several other indy games (Trollbabe, which also never defines "d10", and at least the prerelease PDF of Full Light, Full Steam - I haven't checked the printed copy to see if Joshua acted on my suggestion to define these terms). <br/><br/>This doesn't make these games terrible texts. It does, however, mean that a complete roleplaying newbie, with only the text, is going to be confused by unexplained jargon, just because the writers have an unconscious assumption that "everyone knows who the GM is and what an NPC is".<br/><br/>There's also an assumption that the text doesn't need to stand alone, because roleplaying is inherently something which is taught by those who know to those who don't know; that there's a social process by which this knowledge is spread aside from the contents of the texts. This is why games like Shock: and Capes provide people with good gameplay despite the fact that many find the texts themselves confusing. But I'd like to challenge that assumption, and support E.T.

We expect a certain amount of familiarity with games, even without realizing it. I think PE is a good entry level game, and it has bee played ad understood (I think) successfully by non-gamers. But it's very difficult for me to tell for sure because i'm to close to both it and games in general.

Heck, we ran an entirely freeform, no-rules campaign in around 1985.<br/><br/>Quick tanget about minis and wargaming:<br/>There actually is a fair bit of experimentation with miniatures gaming out there, but generally it tends to suffer from some of the same issues that affect rpg design.<br/><br/>First, there are a lot of use "Legacy" type rules/mechanics, the same tendency that has produced the "Fantasy Heartbreakers". Essentially, minis games tend towrds having a couple of cool new ideas married to a bunch of stuff that is there because "that's the way it has always been done".<br/><br/>Occasionally though, you'll see designers stepping out and stepping back to look at what is really the essence of the thing and you begin to see some very different sorts of designs, including methods that share some common design philosophy with story games ( but arrived at independantly -Parallel Evolution? Cargo Cult design? Who knows).<br/><br/>Second, there seems to be the problem of commercial viability. The more experimental minis games seem to suffer even a bit more from "niche interest" problems than story-games/indie rpgs.<br/><br/>Third, there doesn't seem to be any central design forum for this kind of stuff on par with The Forge. Instead, what you get are widely physically seperated designers occasionally bumping into each other online or possibly at convetions ( something I recently experienced). The rapid, back-and-forth conversations that act as evolutionary agents for design are simply occuring at a much more glacial pace where minis games are concerned.<br/><br/>Fourth, the long-term after-effects of the rpg'er/wargamer split of the late '70s/ early '80s is still having an ugly impact. Reading both rpg and wargame sites, it strikes me that a lot of hobbyists are unaware of developments and even current design trends in the other camp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82006/#Comment_82006" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T09:47:45+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  9:47AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobertFisher</cite><br/>Here's the thing, though.

For the purpose of bringing in new players, it is no longer desirable to make a point of the line of progression from <i>D&amp;D</i> to <i>Prime Time Adventures</i>, and such may actually be a hindrance. With that in mind, I don't think \xe2\u20ac\u0153converting\xe2\u20ac\x9d existing traditional gamers is a priority.

My thinking is that its easier to explain what a story-game is to the unfamiliar than it is to explain what an RPG is *and* the associatted eccentricities of RPG culture. Basically, people can enjoy <i>The Pool</i> or <i>PTA</i> without really knowing what <i>D&amp;D</i> is, so there's no need to bring that baggage in.\n<blockquote>I think the best case would be for these deigns to be known by their individual names.
