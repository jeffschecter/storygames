If you know who said "Heartbeat of a Timelord" you can skip to my question.  Otherwise, Dr Who spoilers ahead.\n<ul><li>The Master (long-running villainous counterpart to the Doctor) had a beat in his head. 4 notes.  He'd tap them on surfaces his hand was near.  They drove him mad.  He asked the Doctor why he couldn't hear them.</li><li>The Master's 4 beats sounded like the "duh-duh-duh-duh" of the theme song.</li><li>The Master went mad when he stared into the Time Vortex (the magical portal Time Lord kids look into to teach as a mysterious rite of passage)</li><li>Timelords have 2 hearts - a redundant pulminary system like us having 2 lungs.</li><li>The other Timelords were trapped in a particular block of time (the "time war").</li><li>The other timelords couldn't escape without some kind of connection or signal to something outside the time war.</li><li>The Timelords knew the Master and the Doctor would escape the Time War, and wanted to escape.</li><li>The Timelords inserted 4 beats into the Time Vortex in anticipation of the Master looking at it - chosing that sequence in particular since it was the "Heartbeat of a Time Lord"</li></ul>\nSo they tie together the Master's origins, the fact that Timelords have 2 hearts, the Time War, and the Theme Song.  This is my favorite kind of retcon moment.<br/><br/>Are there any games that do this better than In A Wicked Age?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312892/#Comment_312892" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T11:17:56+00:00" title="February 16, 2011 11:17AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Microscope                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312893/#Comment_312893" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T11:20:28+00:00" title="February 16, 2011 11:20AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm!<br/><br/>In a Wicked Age... seems pretty well suited for this kind of thing.<br/><br/>I've also had many interesting moments like the one you describe in my game <i>Land of Nodd</i>.<br/><br/><i>Annalise</i> and <i>unWritten</i> have some mechanics that are very similar, so they may produce some of these moments too (but I don't know firsthand).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312899/#Comment_312899" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T11:29:15+00:00" title="February 16, 2011 11:29AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found that that kind of thing happens quite a bit in Universalis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312900/#Comment_312900" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T11:35:21+00:00" title="February 16, 2011 11:35AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't call this a "retcon", which as far as I know originated in comic or sf fandom, in which a later writer/creator eliminates or seriously revises something previously established.

(For example, in IaWA, recurring Oracle elements can create unexpected links between time periods/chapters, as well as the suggestion that people bring their characters back as unexpected Oracle elements.)<br/><br/>When I've played collaborative story-telling games (I've designed a handful), this sort of thing happens sometimes, just because people are telling a story together and they like seeing plot twists and revelations.

It is much more cost-effective to reuse components than to create new ones.  Even if we weren't driven to produce narrative out of chaos (which I think we are), you can get more control over the situation by drawing in previously defined things, events, characters, etc. for less cost.  Once that's happening, it's quite natural for the players to build <i>reasons</i> for various confluences.  <br/><br/>Also, it's half-price to advocate on the side of a challenge that's backed up by previously established (paid-for) facts.  I'm not certain that that incentivizes the coincidence-revelation-thing, but it seems like it might.<br/><br/>I do know that my favorite moments across quite a few Uni games are when during the fourth or fifth scene -- particularly at a con with people I've never met before, <i>it all comes together</i> in a way that nobody planned and everybody contributed to.  It <i>feels</i> like something magical just happened even if we can totally explain it all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312909/#Comment_312909" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T12:22:49+00:00" title="February 16, 2011 12:22PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds cool, Christopher.

Why doesn't the Doctor?  What did the Master see that drove him mad?<br/><br/>And, um, well, then you'd answer them. In play. Before the session was over. Ok, I'm not clear on when or how. One fun option might be - whoever introduces the question does not get to answer it.<br/><br/>And you might consciously leave something unanswered, but it would be a Big Deal, like the ending of Inception - you'd shine a spotlight on that unanswered question before you roll credits.<br/><br/>Because we like to introduce mysteries as we play, right. We're all very show-don't-tell here.
