What I'm wondering about is...<br/><br/>1.  Are these rules clear and understandable?  Is there anything you'd specifically want more explanation of?<br/><br/>2.  Should I put in more examples?  Is there anything in particular you'd like to see an example of?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!<br/><br/><b>Making a Vampire</b><br/> <br/>Vampires have three Traits:<br/> <br/>Beast        - physical capability<br/>Mastery      - social capability<br/>Darkness     - supernatural capability<br/> <br/>Divide 13 points among the three traits as you choose, putting at least one point in each.<br/> <br/>Now, choose five Keywords for your vampire.  Each keyword is attached to a trait, and answers a question that relates to that trait.  The questions are:<br/> <br/>Beast:     What animal do you have characteristics of?  OR  In what physical way are you superior to humans?<br/> <br/>Mastery:   How do you control your victims?<br/> <br/>Darkness:  What do you control or do that's supernatural?<br/> <br/>Example:  If you were trying to make a vampire with powers like Dracula's, you might choose:<br/> <br/>Beast:  wolf, bat<br/>Mastery:  mesmerism<br/>Darkness:  turn into animals, insubstantiality<br/> <br/>If you wanted to have an Anne Rice sort of vampire, you might choose:<br/> <br/>Beast:  speed, strength<br/>Mastery:  seduction<br/>Darkness:  telepathy, telekinesis<br/> <br/>You have to have at least one keyword for each trait.<br/> <br/>Next, you choose Weaknesses.  This works just like choosing Keywords, except that the questions are different:<br/> <br/>Beast:      What physical things harm or repel you?<br/> <br/>Mastery:    Who are you powerless to control?  OR  Where can you not go?<br/> <br/>Darkness:   What prevents you from using your supernatural abilities?  OR What can reveal you for what you really are?<br/> <br/>Again, you have to have at least one weakness for each trait.<br/> <br/> <br/><b>Making a Victim</b><br/> <br/>Victims have three Traits:<br/> <br/>Prowess            - physical capability<br/>Will               - social / mental capability<br/>Innocence          - protection from the supernatural<br/> <br/>Divide up 7 points among these as you choose, putting at least one point in each.<br/> <br/>Now, choose five Keywords for your victim.  Each keyword is associated with a trait, and answers a question about that trait.  The questions are:<br/> <br/>Prowess:     What can you do that most others can't?<br/>Will:        How do you resist others' attempts to control you?<br/>Innocence:   What protects you from the supernatural?<br/> <br/>You have to have at least one keyword for each trait.<br/> <br/>Next, choose five weaknesses for your victim.  This works just like choosing keywords, except that the questions are different:<br/> <br/>Prowess:     What puts you at risk, but you do it anyway?<br/>Will:        What makes you vulnerable to others' control?  (Thanks to Johnstone Metzger for helping with this one!)<br/>Innocence:   What tempts you to do things you know are wrong?<br/> <br/>You have to have at least one weakness for each trait.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189784/#Comment_189784" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T13:45:49+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  1:45PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems fairly clear.<br/><br/>If your Beast and Mastery traits can be supernatural powers, what's the point of Darkness?

Miscellaneous supernatural capabilities?</blockquote>\nWell... yes, that's part of it.  The other part is that you can't use your Beast or Mastery to do anything that's outright supernatural -- you can do those things that humans can do, only better.<br/><br/>For example, in order for Dracula to turn into a bat, he *needs* that "transform into animals" keyword on Darkness, because humans just can't do that.  Without it, he could use his "bat" keyword to hear really well, or to climb the side of a castle (even upside down, since a human could in theory do that, if he/she were strong enough), but he can't use it to fly or turn into a bat without having a Darkness keyword to let him.  Similarly, he could use his "wolf" keyword to run fast, to leap, to smell things better than any human could -- because those are things that humans do, he just does them better.<br/><br/>On the "miscellaneous powers" side, Darkness is your chance to really go crazy.  Want to have a shadow that can reach out and do things physically, like Nosferatu?  That's a Darkness power.  Want to turn into mist, like Dracula?  Or seemingly teleport around as people run away from you, like Jerry Dandrige in "Fright Night"?  Any of those can be Darkness powers.\n<blockquote>Some Victim examples would be good. What kind of traits make you want to be controlled? "I love the monarchy"? A fear of violence, or responsibility?</blockquote>\nThose are possibilities.  Others would be things like, "I need the attention of men" (Lucy in Dracula), "I'm desperate for a friend" (Laura in Carmilla), <br/><br/>Hmm.  Thinking about it, though, those could also come under Innocence's "What tempts you to do things you know are wrong?"  I think I need to come up with a different question for one or both... probably Will.  Maybe something like "What makes you vulnerable to control?"  (Different from *wanting*, since it could be a failing, rather than something active.)  That could be things like "sheltered life", "overconfidence", "needs a father figure", "is socially isolated", "afraid of physical threats", etc.<br/><br/>Yeah, I'll change it to that.

Or what might allow a relationship between them?</blockquote>\nIn narrative terms, it could be.  In mechanical terms, using a victim's weakness against them gives you extra dice when attempting to reduce that trait.<br/><br/>In order to turn someone into a vampire, you first have to reduce their Innocence to zero.  So, if that's your goal as a vampire, you'd want to use their Innocence weakness in your narration.\n<blockquote>"Control" is a bit strong, why not influence? The influence of others, persuasive influence, social influence, etc.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure... influence is more technically correct, but control sounds better to me... and reducing someone's Will to zero does allow you full control over them, making them a Renfield.  I'll think about changing it, but will at least make it clear in the text that you're only influencing someone until/unless you get them to Renfield status.\n<blockquote>What about mesmerism? That's borderline supernatural - Dracula doesn't seem to be very persuasive without fancy powers, right? He doesn't talk Harker into doing much except his job, and even then he creeps him out. Doesn't he use it on Lucy at range, calling her to him (like the vampire power Summon)?</blockquote>\nYeah, he seems to, and he definitely has psychic contact with Mina over a distance.  Part of it is that Dracula, as Stoker describes him, has a whole laundry list of powers -- too many to fit into the five keywords.  In my terms, he'd be "doubled", since he's the only major character who's a vampire in the book.  I may throw in something to give a "doubled" vampire more keywords.<br/><br/>The borderline of supernatural is okay for Beast and Mastery, following the whole "you can do what humans can, but you do it better" thing.  For example, with a Beast keyword of "strength", you can lift things that no human could lift.  Similarly, with Dracula's "Mastery" keyword of "mesmerism", he can do things no human mesmerist could -- actually make people do things against their will, for example.<br/><br/>(And yeah, I know, "doubled" is an awful term.  I really need something better.  "Master" would work on the vampire side, but victims can also be "doubled", and "Master victim" just sounds strange.  Any suggestions?)\n<blockquote>(ps you put and extra "en" in my name. dont feel too bad - my first paycheck is always wrong)</blockquote>\nAhh!!!
