I have recently published my first full-length Savage Worlds Fan World, called Wings and Tails. It's fully illustrated! <br/>\n<br/>\nWings and Tails is a high adventure, steampunk roleplaying game about the clashing worlds and dangerous politics of the frontier Mouse Kingdoms. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis game is written as an expansion to Savage Worlds Explorer's Exdition, and includes optional rules to integrate "Wings of War" WW1 air combat boardgames rules into your roleplaying adventure. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to an illustrated world history, six playable character archetypes, and 19 pages of printable game resources, Wings and Tails contains a complete 4 chapter adventure, fully scripted with branching story lines. Designed to be run in 4 evenings, the adventure is perfect for novice Game Masters, and has enough depth to thrill veteran adventurers as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoyable by furries and non-furries alike, the animals enable the GM to present the difficult theme of colonialism and racism in a way that players find fun and approachable. Think Animal Farm. Also, it's adorable. <br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.goodideagames.com/wingsandtails<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd drop a line in the "Who Are you?" Section but that's blocked from my office...<br/>\nI'm an old school gamer looking to give back. I have a ton of ideas and I want to make something wonderful.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366301/#Comment_366301" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T12:05:45+00:00" title="March  9, 2012 12:05PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Integrating Wings of War is a wonderful idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sp4m" title="Sp4m"><img alt="Sp4m" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sp4m">Sp4m</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366536/#Comment_366536" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T08:16:17+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  8:16AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks! It plays out really well. I've recently been playing a lot with hybrid RPGs, using different system to resolve and encourage conflict in "Story Games."<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently had a birthday party where players were all space pirates/marines and our conflict started as ship to ship, and we played a game of Artemis: Space Ship Bridge Simulator to make it feel real. The RPG continued in a traditional manner, until we had a surface engagement with Laser Tag.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
