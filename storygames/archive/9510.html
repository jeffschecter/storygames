It's sad. It misses out a wonderfully evocative story theme.<br/><br/>But I wonder whether indie games make the same assumption: that death means the end of the character. Sometimes it's expressed in rules like "Your character only dies if you choose to". Again, it precludes an important story element.<br/><br/>The only game I know that does something <i>interesting</i> with death is Poison'd: you face judgement, and can become a ghost. But, even then, death feels like the end of the character, when it should be the next stage of the story.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210855/#Comment_210855" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T06:25:01+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  6:25AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2009 6:26AM by Adam_Dray.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Take a look at <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9573.phtml" rel="nofollow">Ghostwalk</a> for D&amp;D 3E.

I once did a total party kill.  The bad guys won.  Because of that, it generated conflict for the next 5 years of gaming off and on in that campaign.  Eventually climaxing in a enormous war when the bad guys bit off more territory than they could hold and were pushed somewhat back<br/><br/>.  My recent PC death put the a very powerful weapon in the hands of Khan who wants to conquer the 13 Cities and this weapon will bring  down the mystic wall that protects said 13 cities.  We are still gaming in that world, one character's death has changed the balance of power.  It is very exciting.  <br/><br/>So, sure death means the end of a character...but it usually changes things for the rest of the game so  unexpectently and so organically...

I guess I'm interested in exploring rulesets which do something interesting with the character <i>after</i> death.<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age is good for dead characters (and other non-corporeal characters, such as gods). There's a cleverness about the wording of the rules that doesn't imply characters are alive. <br/><br/>It needn't just be ghosts and underworld trips, either. I guess I just want roleplaying games to handle death more interestingly. Like, I don't think you can die in Apocalypse World. Why not? It'd be great. Ample opportunities for cyborging and haunting. Or Trail of Cthulhu. Why does that game have Health at all? Death is the least of your worries.<br/><br/>I'd just like designers to think about the role that death plays in the game, rather than the default option of ending the character's story.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210888/#Comment_210888" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T08:57:08+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  8:57AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, hey, Graham, <a href="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/death.html" rel="nofollow">Death's Door</a>.

Also, it sounds like the sort of thing that might be great subject matter for a Finnish-style LARP (like that one where people take turns playing the degenerative alcoholic and factors in his life, and he will definitely die when the literal bottle that is the game's only prop is finally drained, the name of which I have forgotten if I ever knew it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210894/#Comment_210894" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T09:11:41+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  9:11AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2009 9:12AM by timfire.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, in <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, dead characters can continue to give and receive Trust. So even if the character is technically "out of the story", they will still have an influence on the narrative. I've always thought that was an interesting way to handle the issue.<br/><br/>I'll also mention that there's nothing saying that the player of a dead character can't continue to inject Fate-related facts into the game. So potentially, if a character dies early, the player could continue to develop and resolve that character's Fate throughout the rest of the game, even though the character themselves are no longer present. That would be pretty interesting, I think, though I've never actually seen it happen (PC's tend to die pretty late in the game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210899/#Comment_210899" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T09:20:26+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  9:20AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2009 9:21AM by Bill_White.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In one game of Ganakagok that I recall very fondly, Fred Hicks played a churlish truth-speaker who drowned under the ice when another PC won a fight with his own conscience and <i>didn't</i> go save him.

And boy did he died. Over, and over, and over again.

Then I got revived. Then he died again. Then he got resurrected... And over and over again. Eventually most of his deaths felt pointless (he would be raised back by his peers), but a couple of times they even got used as plot devices (as when this one time he had to accomplish a quest for his God in the afterlife).<br><br>The thing I hated the most was the fact that, in the long run, role-playing this "I'll sacrifice myself for others" character, I was becoming a lot less efficient than other "playing it safe" players, and it was getting less fun for me.

Mana is the part of the character linked to the web of life, from which the power of magic is drawn. Spirit is the part of the character linked to gods and forces beyond the material world. The traits fluctuate in play. At the point of death, the game's cosmology has it that there is a necessary communication between Mana and Spirit, with each informing the other how to respond to dying. If a character dies with Spirit at 0, there is no communication from Spirit telling Mana to resolve its ties to the material world. The character becomes a soulless being attached bodily to the material world: a ghoul. If a character dies with Mana at 0, there is no communication from Mana telling Spirit to resolve its ties to the material world.

"Oh, fuck, I'm dead...and this looks like another five rounds of combat for the rest of you. I'm going to go meet some ladies now and re-evaluate my life choices."  But it's hard to get around that issue without some other form of weirdness if you have something D&amp;D-esque, to create the sense of risk.<br/><br/>One of the moments I doubt I'll ever forget comes from a Mythender playtest involved Joe McDonald shouting, as his action against his foes, "I die and am reborn." (Purely from how he saw the fiction, not an actual death on the table.)  And that action harmed the Mountain that encased him and wanted him to just die. It's the only time I've seen anyone using their own death, voluntarily, as a combat action in and of itself.  (I've also had people choose to create dead/undead Mythenders, which is fun but gets gonzo fast.)<br/><br/>Here's a question, though: why does "finality" have to be bad? Maybe death in a game may just mean that -- you're fucking dead. But, it also means you get to have some sort of other influence on the game that living characters can't, and I don't mean "keep playing as a ghost." Like, some sort of "closure subsystem," where you change the world somehow that impacts the other characters and your next one. To use a FATE to describe the idea: when you die, you get to place an aspect on the world relating to your accomplishments.

Because of the abruptness and inconvenience of character death, we have come up with a lot of mechanisms in our games to avoid it. I really like the idea, however, of character death really meaning something and impacting everyone at the table (and the world!), and I think funeral scenes -- and perhaps funeral mechanics -- would really drive that home.<br/><br/>The recent assassination of Captain American in Marvel Comics was accompanied by all kinds of in-fiction fanfare, because it meant a lot to those characters. Similarly, in the <i>Conan</i> movie, when Valeria dies, Conan defies nature itself to light her pyre (since the old man says no fire can burn on that hill) and even though she's no longer an active character, she still drives action in the rest of the film (thus making her a form of protagonist).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210934/#Comment_210934" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T11:45:11+00:00" title="June  8, 2009 11:45AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to take a D&amp;D TPK (a natural one, not an artificially-created, illusionist one) and transform that into "now the campaign REALLY starts" with all-dead characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210937/#Comment_210937" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T12:02:20+00:00" title="June  8, 2009 12:02PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2009 12:03PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I'd love to take a D&amp;D TPK (a natural one, not an artificially-created, illusionist one) and transform that into "now the campaign REALLY starts" with all-dead characters.</blockquote>\nI did a GURPS Black Ops game like that.

Still; the player of the dead stay in the game, telling the other players how they remember him/her; what they experienced together, how he/she talked, minutiae of behavior, ticks, crisis and feelings, and other things pertaining to the dead character. The other players will go on talking about him/her, perhaps putting these "memories" into their own words, in the dialogue amongst the living, or just express it through tears or silences.<br/><br/>And in the end of the game, all players participate in a scene from their youth, when all were alive, and happy.

He said that the thread's too advanced for him to post: and let's all be thankful for that, because he'd just post a lot of academic jargon anyway.<br/><br/>We agreed, however, that we'd like games to use death rules appropriate to their genre. For example, this is where D&amp;D fails for me, because ghosts and resurrections are <i>massive</i> in fantasy, but they hardly appear for player characters. Similarly, Poison'd: ghost ships are a huge thing, and there <i>are</i> rules for ghosts, but they're decidedly not as much fun.<br/><br/>This takes in Ryan's point, also, that the finality of death needn't be bad. In Western games, for example, if you die in a duel, you're dead. No second chances. You're dead. Life's cheap.<br/><br/>So, yes. Death rules appropriate to the genre you're writing, please, and less assumption that death = end of character.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211037/#Comment_211037" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T03:21:48+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  3:21AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2009 3:23AM by simjames.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Death was a pretty big feature of a long-running Wraith campaign - but not in the obvious way that you might think.<br/><br/>PCs in Wraith are arguably "not really dead" in the way that we as humans experience death. My father is dead, and I had to face the reality that he was gone from the world... Wraith PCs aren't really "gone", they're just rather detached. However, the supporting cast of a Wraith PC certainly have to face death, and grief-by-proxy works in a self-indulgent kind of way. I also found that the themes of death that are raised by Wraith made the players familiar with different facets of loss and finality, almost like Eskimos with regards to snow, so when the players <i>were</i> faced with them later in the campaign they were ready to wrestle with some good, meaningful scenes.<br/><br/>Something forgotten forever. Something ending with such finality that nothing can claw it back. A person you care about more than anything on the brink of destruction. A person who refuses to deal with their grief. A person you have to say goodbye to and never see again. A person who has outlived everything that he remembers loving. And in the end, a person who faces death and says "It's okay; I've done more than enough. I'm ready to go." This is all stuff that we had happen in the campaign.<br/><br/>So even though the PCs were kinda "not dead" themselves, we certainly talked about death a lot in that campaign; the dust of years, denial, courage, oblivion, release, sorrow, old age, and even transcendant death. The narrative conceit of playing as ghosts just gave us permission to explore these things without being too <i>morbid</i>. I think that it was worthwhile, and I don't know how I could have fit so much into another campaign.<br/><br/>And then we played Victorian Age: Vampire and it was all about sex, really.<br/><br/><br/><i>Edit:</i> Tomas, that sounds wonderful.

In classical campaign-based role-playing games like D&amp;D it is problematic though, as the players invest a lot in their characters throughout the campaign, and may be mortally* wounded by the loss of it.<br/><br/>* "Mortally" as in; <i>If my character dies, I don't want to play on.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211041/#Comment_211041" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T04:58:07+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  4:58AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a player, I think that death had the biggest impact on me during a Nephilim LARP campaign. Not because I died, but because I was a mortal human, and most of the other players were not. You feel the difference between "If they decide to kill me, that's it" and the opposing "If they decide to kill me, I won't be around for awhile."<br/><br/>And things weren't terribly pleasant for my character. He'd had bones broken, his eyes ripped out, and potential allies turned against him. But being blinded was by ar the best thing that happened to my character; I wasn't able to participate as recklessly as other characters might, so I spent a lot more time listening to other people... and before too long, to myself. Hours of furious action and debate weren't solving anything for the Nephilim around me, and they obviously didn't have the answers. Leaving behind the assumptions and baggage that I'd previously been chained to, I observed and acted/refrained from acting as appropriate in this new metacontext. My fircest opponent became a trusting ally; I realised that death no longer mattered because <i>dying could in no way diminish me anymore</i>; and I handed to my beloved enemy the blindfold that I no longer needed in order to see.<br/><br/>(This is what happens when I LARP in a blindfold; my inner monologue turns into wanky Grant Morrison, I guess. :P )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211073/#Comment_211073" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T10:35:46+00:00" title="June  9, 2009 10:35AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some grist for the mill:<br/>* In <i>Universalis</i>, one can create a Fact for a character that it's Dead or Was Killed or similar. But it's not actually off the table as a component until all of its Facts are eliminated (including, paradoxically, it's "Dead" Fact). Dead is just a characteristic, the character can continue on (in flash back, in "miraculous survival," as a memory of emotional influence, etc...).<br/><br/>* In <i>Pendragon</i>, if you play a full campaign, you WILL die. That's what makes wooing the ladies and spawning heirs so relevant: all that you've accomplished (in terms of honor, holding, influence) must be passed on or it is redistributed to your rivals.<br/><br/>* Contrary to popular opinion, <i>Vampire</i> games (LARPs, in particular) can be a very powerful way to explore the themes of death. I've regaled other players with tales of the pain and eventual pleasure of recovering the ability to eat; I've had weepy(ish) one-on-one RP moments with players talking about how much I miss a family that I can never see again, for their own safety (never mind sanity); I've played a PC on a Path which instructed its followers to expunge all emotion, the better to achieve Gehenna--what would be more like the living dead than joyless, monotone centuries, I ask you?<br/><br/>* And I TOTALLY concur with this (before y'all go thinking I'm an emo freak):<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite>I always thought Dread: Pandemonium handled death well for a semi-traditional style game.</blockquote>Funnily enough, I have a similar effect in <i>GLASS</i>, for Player-Priority games, with the Commit rule. <a href="http://glasscutters.org/GLASS.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://glasscutters.org/GLASS.pdf</a>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tristan</cite>The first times it felt dramatic and powerful. Then I got revived. Then he died again. Then he got resurrected... And over and over again. Eventually most of his deaths felt pointless</blockquote>Ahh... sounds to me like you weren't playing AD&amp;D(1). Because, first of all, that's getting REALLY lucky on your System Shock survival check. And after that, you get even luckier on your Resurrection Results chart. And all THAT's predicated on the fact that your god didn't demand you stay dead (out of embarrassment, if nothing else).<br/><br/>Reminds me of boffer LARPs where folks get knocked down to 0 health, go "Unconscious," and then are healed for 1 point, allowing them to resume fighting... and then knocked down again in seconds.

Look at Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs: right there at the bottom are the ones that we need to stay alive. By taking those out of the equation, the game/story/whatever is no longer about survival in a very real way, and it lets our play and design focus on more "lofty" topics, from sex to security of property to morality and creativity.<br/><br/>This can be handled in games in a variety of ways. Off the top of my head:<br/>1) Death can be ignored -- death is not an issue in this game; characters cannot die under any circumstances (or only in very extreme circumstances); examples: <i>Mouse Guard</i>,and (I think) <i>Conspiracy of Shadows</i>, though I will admit to having not played it; possibly <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, although there is some debate about how lethal games tend to be;<br/>2) Death is a semi-inevitability as a consequence of protracted play -- most campaigns of this game, when played long enough, will end in death or some other form of character transcendence/apotheosis/retirement into non-playable status; examples: <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, <i>Ars Magica</i>, <i>Hero's Banner</i>, <i>Dust Devils</i>;<br/>3) Death is a transitory or avoidable outcome -- PCs can come back from the dead, either as ghosts, some other undead, or by simple resurrection; examples: <i>In A Wicked Age</i>, at least one form of traditional-play <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>, most video game "RPGs".<br/><br/>That said, death is something tangible and (arguably) easy-to-define. It's usually binary. A character is dead or not dead. Play is driven by the character being not-dead, so they strive to maintain that state. It's tougher in design and play terms to create situations which mirror, say, spontaneity (picking something from the peak of Maslow's pyramid at random), as clearly and as compellingly.</blockquote>\nA few clarifications and thoughts since then: As David Artman rightfully points out, <i>Pendragon</i> would fall into the second category.<br/><br/>The second category should also be broken down into 2(a): Games where characters will eventually die because they are mortal and all mortals die (ie <i>Pendragon</i>); and 2(b): Games where characters will eventually die because their story will have reached its ending/it is genre-appropriate (ie <i>Dust Devils</i>). The basic principle of inevitability is the same, but the reasoning behind it is different.<br/><br/>Also, games in the 2(a) group, rather than being an example of "removing death" could actually be seen as <i>using</i> death to force players into exploring other parts of the pyramid; like in real life, it is mortality that gives those other explorations their spice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211253/#Comment_211253" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T03:32:48+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  3:32AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm specifically talking about using death <i>as part of</i> the story: with the implication that the character's story continues after death.

I think what I had hoped to do was make some comparisons to games where death is not at stake to games that "transcend" death by allowing character continuation.<br/><br/>For example: <i>Ars Magica</i> as-written does not include ghosts. A character's play ends with death; but the character's <i>impact</i> does not, because during their lives, characters create artifacts, texts, and spells, as well as teach apprentices and ponder magical theory. So, "the character's story continues after death" in a sense.<br/><br/>I guess what I was getting at by cross-posting that here is something like "if a character makes real impact on a game-world (shared fiction) during life/play, then what are the possible implications on play of the dead character?"<br/><br/>I guess that's a little farther afield than what you had originally meant by this thread, but I think it's potentially valuable. If you play a "generational" game, like <i>Pendragon</i>, then in what sense are you playing a series of characters, and in what sense are you playing a "meme", mutating through generations? In games like that, ideas (spells, tomes, instructions; or in <i>Pendragon</i>, specific traits and tendencies) are transmitted between individual characters, forming a continuity.<br/><br/>Sorry for how sloppily-presented this idea is. It makes sense in my head.

The manitou possession mechanic can make for some very interesting play, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nGames like D&amp;D are specifically geared to avoiding death, or circumventing it in every way possible.  I've found that in running 4E that it's nearly impossible to kill a character, and the new rituals make Raise Dead ridiculously easy.  But that's because the game is aimed directly at the 'death =bad' mechanic that arose from its earliest origins- tabletop wargaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nModern RPGs arose from tabletop wargaming and in that venue a dead unit was simply removed.  It's a VERY modern ethos to be looking behind the mechanics and tinkering to create story by use of mechanic.  Traditionally we've had to make story in spite of the mechanics, and death is one of those.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack in the day, you'd hope a character could survive to high levels and then die in a really cool way just as the campaign wound down.  Just so you'd have a cool story to tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we're looking to have our games tell the stories we'd like to tell is we were just sitting down at the fire to tell stories.  That's a lot more ambitious.  The Orpheus tale would be VERY hard to do in straight D&amp;D.  By all rights he should have been destroyed by much higher level opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\nOdysseus visits the underworld and feeds the ghosts blood to return their memories.  There's no system mechanic I'm aware of to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOdin gave up an eye and then sacrificed himself to himself, dying and returning, all to gain wisdom.  Also hard to do in a system.  But all of these are compelling stories that resonate with the human psyche.  Trying to do the same with our hobbies is a lofty goal.  But VERY hard to achieve, especially since you aren't doing a story focused on ONE  hero.  Rather you have a party, their players want different things from the play of the game, their characters have a wide variety of motivations, and they may not all be physically in the same place or in the same status (ie they may not all be dead at the same time.).<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do we make death meaningful, and yet not an impediment to fun.  I don't know, but I think it's worth discussing more.  I'd like to focus on how to make death meaning ful without being a barrier in games where it's NOT part of the system as designed, but I can start a thread on that seperately if you'd like me to.<br/>\n<br/>\n(PS: in ET, one of the D&amp;D players continued to play his character as a zombie . . . just a thought!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212278/#Comment_212278" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-14T21:59:11+00:00" title="June 14, 2009  9:59PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Artillery_MKV</cite>Odysseus visits the underworld and feeds the ghosts blood to return their memories.

Using a 'I have no idea how to make this work, so just roll some dice' mechanic, which is simply a method for making the GMs story objectives seem less arbitrary, is NOT the same thing as have your game designed to deal with death and dying.  We can bring up exceptions to the issue, and talk about one player solutions, but that's not truly at the core of the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe heart of this is you have a group at the table.  Their characters have engaged in the activies expected of them as Pcs and through the course of the story one of them is dead.  Other than having the player roll a new character, how do you AND the game system react to that. ("well, now that my Mage Phil died, I'll be playing his twin brother Bill, who is motivated by REVENGE!" only goes so far)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly a TPK leading to an Underworld game isn't the problem.  It's the lone death that disrupts the tempo of play and puts a hitch in the rest of the game the GM planned until the new character can be introduced or the old one raised, or whatever mechanic is used to return the player to their status of playing. How can the player's new role (as dead guy) be satisfying to the player, the rest of the party and the GM?  How can the player be ACTIVE while dead?<br/>\n<br/>\n4E reacts by making death so easily reversible that death might as well not be in the game.  It's like an MMO, basically you respawn with a minor penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a storytelling GM that doesn't resonate for me.  I'd much rather have a 'ghost' or 'revenant' template that could be applied to the character after death.  Then the character could be played and a SECOND death would mean discorporation, or some such mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212527/#Comment_212527" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T02:05:18+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  2:05AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that's the Ghostwalk campaign for 3.0 in a nutshell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212548/#Comment_212548" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T06:07:43+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  6:07AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Artillery?

If the GM has no plan to disrupt, the death of the character becomes one more event in the ongoing fiction.  I think this is the sort of thing the Old School Renaissance have in mind when they talk about sandbox play.  The player simply reenters play with a new character, which is not required to be connected to any narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212808/#Comment_212808" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T03:34:01+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  3:34AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_campaign_settings#Ghostwalk" rel="nofollow">This is the Wikipedia section</a> about Ghostwalk; it was a hardcover expansion released <i>juuuust</i> before 3.5.
