Vinny Salzillo, one of the head honchos with Double Exposure (the group that puts on Dreamation and Dexcon in New Jersey every year), is looking at adding a third con to his schedule the weekend of November 4-6, 2011, and has asked me to help him by soliciting some input from the community. It would be held as usual at the Morristown Hyatt. The difference for this show from the other two would be that indie roleplaying would be the sole feature of the show. Attendance would be limited to players who expressed interest in playtesting and demoing of new or unfamiliar games. As he put it, "programming would consist of concept development, playtest events, new modules, requested events among peers and panels &amp; seminars." Think of it as everything you like about Dreamation, but without the distractions of boardgames, minis games, game shows, and chocolate fests. OK, maybe some chocolate, but nothing else!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sort of "summer camp for indie designers" would probably cost publishers $50-ish for entry, plus reasonably cheap rooms for the two nights ($99 a night); attendees (who would be mostly picked out of DE's impressive mailing list as regular participants in the Indie Game Explosions at previous shows, but certainly anybody reading this on story-games could also get in) would probably be limited to 100-150, at probably something like $20 a ticket for them. We'd pack the schedule with events morning to night. Everything at the show would be directed at indie cutting-edge roleplaying, with no competition or distractions. AFAIK, the only requirement for coming as a "publisher" would be the desire to start making cool rpgs- you wouldn't need to have actually published anything yet, and in fact new designers would be specifically welcomed and encouraged to get some playtest time in with some very strong players as well as networking with your peers. Honestly, my biggest concern for the show would be the nightmare of scheduling- everybody's going to want to run their own awesome games but also play in each other's! Nevertheless, I have faith in Vinny's organizational skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if such an event were to take place, who here would be interested in signing up, as either a publisher or player? What additional questions would you have for Vinny? IPR itself may or may not be officially involved with the show, but I certainly would be there and will for now be helping Vinny collect opinions and ideas for the show, so please go ahead and respond here if you're in (or if you're out and have a potentially fixable reason why, as opposed to "I can't get to New Jersey in November.")

But it fills a regional void around here on the calendar.  The exception being Uber Con, which is rather prohibitive to reach unless you have a car.  <br/><br/>As John points out above, Dreamation is already running into scheduling conflicts with Pax East.  Tilting the focus of the tri-state indie gaming to November (or adding to it) might be a healthier move for the hobby all around.  Presuming it generalizes its indie play.  I'd be happy to attend a test-track at least once but i'm not certain of the long term attraction.  That said, there are quite a few board game designers in the greater nyc area and why not invite them too?  horses for courses.  i'm out of here... i think the morphine's kicking in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320219/#Comment_320219" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-12T20:14:02+00:00" title="April 12, 2011  8:14PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I endorse the idea of breaking the "all indie games debut at Gen Con (whether they're done or not)" cycle.

But each of you seems to have a common source of frustration - the short period of time you have to do the four major things that DREAMATION demands - 1) Premiering and testing, 2) Selling, 3) Shmoozing and 4) Playing in games run by your peers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I analyzed the yearly production schedule (as I'm sure others have done, particularly the guys who put on IndieCon in the UK), and saw the possibility of gently changing the way designers look at their convention schedule here in the U.S. DREAMATION became the focus of the Indie get-together, but everyone was trying to do a bunch of things at once. So playtesting and new ideas were being shown first at DREAMATION and then months of revisions took designers to the summer convention schedule (Origins, DEXCON, GEN CON) without any way to revisit the revisions. Plus, everyone was so busy trying to entertain the mass of convention attendees, they barely had enough time to have their ideas play out anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter a publisher-centric event, timeframe November. If we made this event THE place for designers to present their new ideas and gather the energy necessary to flesh out all of the new products, it would cause a whip effect to get the "second generation" product ready for DREAMATION, and from there onto the summer convention season. The main focus of the November event would be to eliminate the aspect of DREAMATION which is a "show" for attendees. As Darren indicated, the non-designers who would be at the show would be paying $20 each because THEY are providing a service to the designers, not the other way around. Designers would be free to shmooze, bounce ideas, and play with their peers, pulling in additional bodies only at their discretion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we did the playtest experiment at DREAMATION 2010, I labelled it a failure, but NOT because of the designers - the issue was exclusively that the playtesters themselves flaked out because, well, DREAMATION has a LOT going on, and too many distractions. So THIS event would be pretty much dedicated to the whims of the designers.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason, you asked why you should premiere your game with 100 of your closest friends. I imagined an event where it was prestige and an honor to unveil new ideas to your peers, and after receiving whatever criticism and playtesting you were looking for, spend the next three months getting the new stuff into shape ready for the "general public" at DREAMATION, and perhaps a final version at the summer cons. And why would that be different than just doing it on a random weekend with the local designers? Because all of the Double Exposure energy will go into scheduling, hospitality, providing suitable function space and ensuring that anyone's idea is as visible as everyone else's, and won't fall into a "clique" situation. And it will be focused on YOUR needs, not the needs of normal convention attendees. A fixed schedule means that we're making sure that two new games with a similar theme or genre are not going up against each other, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat $50 fee is the only way we can pay for the space to do this. We'll run the Double Exposure con suite, we'll fully staff the event so that problems are dealt with throughout the convention, we'll provide security, we'll coordinate parties, all the things you would expect from DREAMATION, but without the burden of putting on a show for everyone else :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly do not see a need to restrict this to just RPGs - Board Game designers would be welcome as well. Smirk &amp; Dagger, Bucephalus, Stronghold, Firestorm Ink, would all be invited, as well as anyone who wants to show off an idea, even if it never moved from three pencils and a six-sided die.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, there would be NO rules regarding attendance - if you're paying your $50 fee as a designer, you set your own rules about what you want to do and how many players you want at your table. Even to request that your table will be filled ONLY by other designers - something we'll facilitate for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook; this is exploratory. I have gotten a lot of positive feedback verbally about the idea. I'm assuming some financial risk, but I think it is worth giving it a try. I would love to hear more from people on this forum about how to ensure that it is YOUR event. I've always strived for that at DREAMATION, but the most criticism I've received from Indie designers is that (rightfully), I have to put the needs of the attendees above the needs of the designers. I think with a November Indie-centric event, a lot of that burden will be removed from DREAMATION and we'll all feel better about showing the attendees a good time in February. Heck, we might even decide to put in some DE-run programming with no other purpose than to entertain the designers!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I'll give a free designer membership to whoever comes up with a name for the event that we all like :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Vinny                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darren%20Watts" title="Darren Watts"><img alt="Darren Watts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darren%20Watts">Darren Watts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320289/#Comment_320289" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T09:20:50+00:00" title="April 13, 2011  9:20AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: jenskot<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect we are going to see a significant game designer exodus from Dreamation next year in favor of Pax East. Which I don't want to happen but understand why (it has nothing to do with Dreamation other than the two convention being physically and chronologically close by and Pax offering Gen Con level sales).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI personally doubt this will happen- having worked the "indie section" at both shows this past year, I saw a lot of the same publishers who were quite happy with how both shows went, and it seems clear that they offer very different experiences, challenges and benefits.

Likewise, if I was still living in Boston and had <a href="http://jiffycon.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">JiffyCon</a> semi-regularly, I would seriously consider it, but it wouldn't be a strong need.  I don't know much about how things are in the Mid-Atlantic or Southeast.  Maybe Camp Nerdly serves that rolle for them, as Jason says.<br/><br/>Part of the thing that makes those mini-conventions work is that they are indie games conventions put on by indie games people, folks who are already a part of the community and instinctively "get" what the needs and style of the community is and how best to serve it.  If this is really going to occupy the same kind of space or a similar kind of space (since there will undoubtedly be differences as well), I think you really need to get some indie games people on board to help you set this up in a way that feels comfortable and useful.<br/><br/>Right now I'm sensing a few disconnects.  For example:<br/><br/>1) Increasingly, there's less of a distinction between designers and non-designers in the community, though there are certainly people who are more well known for having published certain games.  At indie games meetups, people just come to play games and also bring whatever they're working on -- be it an independent game or just some content or hack of an existing game. In general, the community tries to downplay the vibe that you can "hobnob with famous designers" and is more into the longstanding close friendships that people have developed over the past 10 years of hanging out online and at meetups and conventions.  I'd be excited to play in a game with Jason, not because he's "THE Jason Morningstar" but because he's a cool cat that I only get to see every few years.<br/><br/>2) Also, there's increasingly less of a distinction between games that are "finished and published" and games that are informally published (like as a free PDF) or in the process of still being polished.  Games like Lady Blackbird and Dungeon World have seen an enormous amount of play recently, for example, and that wasn't "playtesting" really so much as enjoying a product that doesn't exist in print or for sale.  As a consequence of the above, there's much less of a distinction between play and playtesting as well.  People sit down and expect to play something fun and interesting, no matter if it's "finished" or not.<br/><br/>3) Generally speaking, the vibe at meetups is pretty informal. Some games are scheduled but, often, 50% of more of the sessions that happen at an indie games convention are unscheduled.  Some of these are organized through informal recruitment: you mention to some people that you want to play something and they eventually try to find time and make it happen.  Sometimes you announce your game on the spot, to a bunch of folks who don't have another game planned.  Or you walk through the lounge after the slot has come around and you see who doesn't have anything to play.  "Any of you folks want to play a dungeon-y game?"  That kind of thing.<br/><br/>4) Sales at indie meetups typically happen through folks buying copies directly from the designer, either coming up to them personally and asking for one or, sometimes, through a bunch of copies sitting out on a table and, when someone wants to buy one, the person manning the table directs them to the designer.  The building of personal connections is pretty important.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that your convention has to have all of these traits for it to be a welcome and exciting place for indie designers and indie games fans to be.  But it's important to consider what Jason means when he asks about "the added value."  This is what we already have, sprinkled about the country in various locations.  In some respects, this is what we want or think we want or are comfortable with.  So it's important to consider how this new convention fits into the larger picture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320315/#Comment_320315" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T10:51:03+00:00" title="April 13, 2011 10:51AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having access to 100-150 playtesters who are outside my social circle that I can meet with in person seems valuable. <br/><br/>For some people, finding playtesters is easy.

But for me entirely besides the point for exactly the reasons Graham suggests.<br/><br/>If we as a community have someone who has really been open to accomodating our community even if he isn't knee-deep-in-the-hoopla himself, AND that person is willing to try to make a go of accomodating us even further (ideally for mutual benefit)...then I'm all like "Thanks for making the effort!" and let's jump in with both feet and see if it works.<br/><br/>If it doesn't, then, like Southern Exposure, it becomes an experiment that didn't pan out.  But if it does then it becomes a Mid-Atlantic U.S. Indie Con.  How great would that be.<br/><br/>It would be a shame to miss the opportunity by overanalysing the many ways in which it might not be perfect its first year out.<br/><br/><br/>That said, Vinnie, there are quite a few indie souls who have some experience in putting together indie-oriented throw-downs (I being not one of them) that you could probably rope into an advisory council to help orientate things were you so inclined.<br/><br/>But I'll say this.
