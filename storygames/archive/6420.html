One had some interesting ideas but these were very under-developed and the organization was a dog's breakfast. The other was a wargame first (not that I don't like wargames, but that's not what I want here).<br/><br/>My game about mercenary pilots has to have:<br/><br/>1. Pilots who are larger than life. Who have Drama going on all over the place, and Problems that can only lead to a fiery end literally and/or figuratively.<br/><br/>2. Aircraft that are an extension of the character. They're on the character sheet. You give them a name and draw nose art for them. They're that important.<br/><br/>3. A dogfight system that is tactical and has the right air-combat "color" ("I pull a 4G yoyo and drop onto his six, 'Fox 2!'"), allowing for move and counter-move, but is not a hex-and-counter wargame, and requires no map (but minis of airplanes to show relative positions and whooshing noises are just fine). A dogfight system that links it to the story of the pilots flying the planes. Maybe a system that treats <i>all</i> conflict as a dogfight?<br/><br/>4. Group creation of the squadron and some management of its affairs (negotiation of contracts, maintenance and supply issues, etc) that isn't just bean-counting and making lists. It has to have an impact on the main characters - the pilots.<br/><br/>5. Drama and conflict that plays out on the ground as well as in the air. In fact, when the pilots are in the air, they should be carrying their dirtside burdens with them and sometimes (often) working those problems out in the air, in combat.<br/><br/>How can I achieve these things?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Novembre" title="Novembre"><img alt="Novembre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Novembre">Novembre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142144/#Comment_142144" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-03T02:24:41+00:00" title="May  3, 2008  2:24AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Out of curiosity: were the games you bought <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/31661" rel="nofollow">Mercenary Air Squadron</a> and <a href="http://flyingmice.com/wildblue.html" rel="nofollow">In Harm's Way: The Wild Blue</a>?

I've been eyeing those for a while... I'm interested to the topic, but less than convinced of the execution.</blockquote>\nYes, in fact they were. Mercenary Air Squadron is a decent game, but it is a boardgame, an air combat simulation. That's fine for what it is, but it's not a story game, or even a trad RPG. In Harm's Way: The Wild Blue is an RPG but suffers from very poor organization, scattershot and incomplete rules, and under-developed ideas. Granted, some of those under-developed are the gems to be plucked out and shined up I think.<br/><br/>IHW:WB proposes group generation of the squadron, and this bit is certainly worthy of snatching. The "troupe play" idea in the book is woefully underdeveloped, meriting only a paragraph that really only suggests the idea rather than showing you how to fully implement it. The dogfight system is a subsystem of the main task resolution system (or maybe it's the other way around) and does a piss-poor job of explaining itself. The rules mention certain things but give no explanation of what they are; for example, aircraft characteristics are given but not explained; damage from missile impacts is "exactly the same as cannon fire" - but cannon fire is not explained anywhere. The maneuvers are interesting to look at but you don't get any context in how they are used - what maneuver counters what maneuver? There is a provision for ground based troops in action, but this feels unfinished as well and is a dilution of the game's main focus. A large percentage of the page count is given to chargen, but is mostly based on working up a large skill list you will likely never use. Naturally, there is a long list of equipment, right down to sleeping bags and flashlights that really isn't necessary. It's not a game you can play without a lot of piecing together the designer's intentions, or a lot of reading between the lines and working with standard RPG assumptions.<br/><br/>But, like I said, it has some snatch-worthy ideas, squadron group-gen and troupe play being the most noteworthy. I think these are fairly easy to develop more fully.<br/><br/>One of the things I find most difficult to conceptualize with this idea is how to story-game a dogfight that doesn't handwave energy-based air combat maneuvering. The maneuvers in a dogfight are checking and trumping each other, and the planes' design and performance, plus the pilots' skill, are key, and all factored together. Modeling this naturally lends itself to a wargame-style simulation, which is what I want to minimize. I think the trick is in there somewhere, somehow making this blend of performance characteristics, skill, and tactics story-gameable.<br/><br/>And, if this is to be a more focused design, how do you deal with the game mechanics outside the cockpit? Is the dogfighting system a separate sub-system of the main system (or indeed, the other way around)? Can a game like this have a unified mechanic? How can it tie into the characters and their aircraft in an integrated way? Does this design start with the characters - the pilots - or does it start with the dogfighting?<br/><br/>Here's an even deeper question - should a game like this, with such a focus on the tactics of air combat and so forth, even <i>be</i> a story game (is it better off as a wargame or simulation-style RPG)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Novembre" title="Novembre"><img alt="Novembre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Novembre">Novembre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142188/#Comment_142188" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-03T14:11:04+00:00" title="May  3, 2008  2:11PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>Yes, in fact they were.</blockquote>\nThank you for clearing my mind about those games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>Here's an even deeper question - should a game like this, with such a focus on the tactics of air combat and so forth, even<i>be</i>a story game (is it better off as a wargame or simulation-style RPG)?</blockquote>\nGood question. I don't really have an answer. Being a wargamer myself, of the kind that likes to wargame for the kick of "being there", I suppose that I would choose a wargame over a RPG to do some dogfighting. Or maybe I would use Wushu. Hell, the more I think of it, the more I'm convinced that with Wushu you could do some awesome dogfighting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142191/#Comment_142191" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-03T14:25:17+00:00" title="May  3, 2008  2:25PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2008 2:30PM by Lord_Minx.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>Here's an even deeper question - should a game like this, with such a focus on the tactics of air combat and so forth, even<i>be</i>a story game (is it better off as a wargame or simulation-style RPG)?</blockquote>Personally: Yes, most certainly.<br/><br/>After all, being a story game doesn't preclude having tactics or even elements of simulation. Like, look at SotC, it's (IMO) certainly what many people here consider a story game, and yet it features a tactical-yet-abstract combat system, complete with positioning and all that jazz, right next to something like the Aspect rules which make things like personality and style of the pilot matter to a great degree.<br/><br/>IMO, the biggest thing to avoid is turning it into a simulation game. I don't see this game getting improved by, dunno, dozen of finely printed pages with "realistic" stats for a bazillion of realworld and fictional airplanes. Much better to make "airplane creation" an integral part of the character creation process where planes are described by traits/aspects/whatever, thus making them unique and integral to the character that flies it. (And by "unique" I also mean stuff like some planes having traits like "Mass-produced" that could be used for repairing them or getting new ones.)<br/><br/>IME, relatively abstract rules that nonetheless shape play in a certain way are often better then rules that are very explicit, detailled and ... "concrete". (At the very least because it's easier to adapt them to cover various situations, like out-of-plane and in-flight.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

So it could be that being a raptor for hire is the only thing that earns enough money to bribe the police to keep her secret out of the hands of the military; or the pilot had a dream that the day he stopped flying, his family was killed. Whatever.</p>\n<p>OK, in super-brief, this is how dogfights work. (You might know this, but I really like talking about it.) This is pretty much true up until the middle of the Viet Nam War, with the advent of the F-4 Phantom and the MiG-21, when guided missiles became more significant.</p>\n<p><strong>Energy</strong> is either kinetic or potential. Kinetic energy is how fast you're going relative to the air around you. Potential energy is in the form of fuel and altitude. By throttling up you can increase your speed, and by falling you can increase your speed. When you go up, you turn kinetic energy into potential energy. When you go down, you turn it back. Sooner or later, you'll turn it back in. Ideally, you do that in a controlled fashion.</p>\n<p><strong>Maneuvering</strong> means "getting behind the other guy." Some planes have a gunner in the back, but that adds a lot of complexity to the plane, so that guy had better be pulling his weight in other ways, like being a bombardier or radar operator or something. It's not really practical for an escort (fighters that cover the payload, like a bomber or cargo craft) or interceptor (fighters that are sent up to shoot down the cargo, bombers, or whatever) because it adds a lot of weight and the structure to carry that weight, plus bigger wings to lift it, plus a bigger engine... So most of the time, you get behind the other guy, where the relative speed between you is small and you shoot a lot of bullets in the hopes of hitting something important. Sometimes that's something in an engine, sometimes it's structure, sometimes it's the guy in the bubble who was going to get a date with that girl this weekend.</p>\n<p>The trick, of course, is in getting back there. The more energy you have, the more maneuvers you have at your disposal. <a href="http://www.combataircraft.com/tactics/index.aspx" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> a nifty site about the options you have.

Still no idea where this might go, or even if any of the following makes any sense, but it's the first time I've been moved to go even this far with an idea I've had for a game. So here we go:<br/><br/>PART I<br/><i><br/>1) Here is the name of the game, and how I came up with the name.</i><br/><br/><b>Fire in the Sky</b> \u2013 This is the name of one of my favorite books on air combat. It\u2019s also somewhat poetic and perhaps invokes the melodramatic nature of the game.<br/><br/><i>2) Here would the "back cover blurb" for the game. Imagine it being read by the "Movie Commercial Guy" ("In a World...")</i><br/><br/>In a world where war is a business, and life and death are commodities to be traded, mercenary pilots fight for fame and fortune, and just maybe, a way back to the lives they left behind.<br/><br/><i>3) This is a brief example of what play might look like. This is a Replay (screenplay) involving three players: Siva, Elise, and Tobias, and no more than 10 "lines" of text.</i><br/><br/>Siva:\tOK, Black Tiger squadron is on CAP over Mertrusa. Elise, you\u2019re still pissed at Tobias for not backing you up in the bar fight last night.<br/><br/>Elise: Yeah, Tobias, I\u2019m going to outgun you in this next fight. No bonus for you. I\u2019m spending a Grudge against Tobias for extra Energy in this scene.<br/><br/>Tobias: We\u2019ll see about that. I\u2019m matching that Grudge.<br/><br/>Siva:\tGood for you both, because you\u2019re gonna need it. Rainbow Tower reports 4 bogies at 30 miles, angels 19.<br/><br/>Elise: \u201cRainbow this is Tiger 2, engaging.\u201d I\u2019m gonna burn that Energy I just picked up and kick in the afterburners to get there before Tobias.<br/><br/>Tobias: Hmph. I let her go. She wants to go charging in alone, fine. I\u2019m gonna burn my Energy to climb and try to get a better angle on the bogies.<br/><br/>Siva: Right, Elise you go blasting into the enemy formation and they break to engage you. It\u2019s a flight of Mig-21\u2019s. Tobias, you\u2019ve got some altitude and can see all the targets. Time to Lock-On. What are your Targets?<br/><br/>Elise: I\u2019m going for it. Trying to lock-on the leader, ignoring the others and burning lots of Energy to get a guns kill. My F-16 has the Dogfighter Trait, and I\u2019m still riding that Grudge so I\u2019m good for this.<br/><br/>Tobias: I\u2019m not in the furball, so I want to lock-on to the leader as well and smoke him with a radar-guided missile before Elise can get her shot in. My F4 has the Superior Radar Trait so I think I can beat Elise on the draw.<br/><br/>Siva: Right, the bandits are going for missile lock-ons on you both, but you're not covering each other at this point so the bandits have an advantage there. Pick your maneuvers and let\u2019s do it!<br/><i><br/>4) This is my target audience.</i><br/><br/>Fans of action adventure/air combat/airplanes.<br/><br/><i>5) These are other games, media, etc am I blatantly stealing from (or, what I am inspired by)</i><br/><br/><i>Area 88</i> is the prime inspiration. Movies like <i>Flight of the Intruder, Macross Plus</i>, and <i>Top Gun</i> for general air combat bad-assitude. For the dogfighting game system, GMT\u2019s <i>Down in Flames</i> series. Robbing some of the ideas like Traits from <i>Spirit of the Century</i> too.<br/><br/><i>6) Here is one single sentence which describes 1-2 things about my game idea that other games don't currently offer (to my knowledge).</i><br/><br/>Fire in the Sky is a story game that offers a tactical air combat system that is tied directly to the characters\u2019 goals and motivations and is an extension of what goes on in their lives.. <br/><br/><i>7) Here, in no more than three sentences, is what the game is about in general.</i><br/><br/>This game is about mercenaries who are trying to escape their pasts by seeking some sort of absolution in combat. Their struggles are played out on the ground and in the air, as they fly missions for a mercenary air squadron operating in Third World warzones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142250/#Comment_142250" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-04T00:46:23+00:00" title="May  4, 2008 12:46AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2008 1:49AM by Mike Montesa.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Had to break this up a bit.<br/><br/><i>8) Here are one to two vignettes about the game's setting.<br/></i><br/>Lt. Shimada\u2019s powerful politician father has come to Karzakistan to try to pressure the government into annulling Shimada\u2019s contract. Lt. Shimada and his father meet each other for the first time in 5 years at the base mess hall and an argument ensues.<br/><br/>Cpt. Moss has a rep for losing every wingman who flies with her. So now she flies alone. But the hotshot new pilot that just joined the squadron not only means to break the curse, he\u2019s out to get her in the sack too. Now, as Moss and the new guy shriek into combat at 25,000 feet against 6 to 1 odds, is the curse going to be his end\u2026or hers?<br/><br/><i>9) This is a description of one to two typical characters in this game.</i><br/><br/>Lt. Keisuke Shimada is the son of a powerful Japanese politician. His father is a controlling man who tried to groom Keisuke to take his seat in the Japanese parliament. Keisuke rebelled and joined the JASDF where he learned to fly. His father cut short his flying career using his political clout. Keisuke left Japan and joined the Black Tigers PMC based out of Johannesburg, hoping to get far away from his father\u2019s influence.<br/><br/>Captain Anne Moss was one of the first woman aviators to fly carrier-based aircraft in the U.S. Navy. Never one to back down from a challenge, she faced discrimination and ridicule from her fellow officers. She was cashiered after an accident killed her RIO, and rather than suck it up and fly a desk, she left the Navy and joined the Black Tigers PMC intending to prove her abilities in combat, but her reputation as a jinx follows her like a black cloud.<br/><br/><br/><i>10) Here is a brief glimpse at what making characters is like.</i><br/><br/>Step one: What are you running from? What made you become a mercenary?<br/>Step two: What is your character's Baggage? What or who is he or she running from? Is it someone from your past? Someone in your squadron? Yourself? What happened between you and them?<br/>Step three: Choose an aircraft and define your characteristics: Speed; Maneuverability; Sensors; G-Rating; Durability; Endurance. Note your aircraft\u2019s Trait(s). Choose a Trait for yourself.<br/><br/><i>11) This is how characters might change over playing the game.</i><br/>Characters who resolve their Grudges also reduce their Anger (which may make them less effective in conflicts), but resolving your Grudges is the only way to end your character\u2019s story.<br/><br/><i>12) This is what part of the game's resolution mechanic might look like.</i><br/><br/>Everything is based on using your Energy to perform Maneuvers, whether in a dogfight, a fistfight, or a verbal argument. Maneuvers are printed on cards which are played in a Rock-Paper-Scissors fashion. Traits can be called on to get more cards or for other advantages. The winner of a hand of Maneuvers achieves a Lock-On and can narrate the resolution of a scene.<br/><br/><i>13) This is a link to a piece of art or two, the likes of which you might find in a copy of the game (or, I might quickly describe a picture or painting that you might see in my game).</i><br/><br/><a href="http://www.gamebgs.com/data/media/10/Millenium_Pilot.jpg" rel="nofollow">A game about the pilots</a> <br/><br/><a href="http://www.acecombat.jp/ace-zero/images/wallpaper/package_b_800x600.jpg" rel="nofollow">the planes they fly</a><br/><br/><a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://users.aol.com/jemcclure/private/1myung.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://users.aol.com/vipercyber/private/gallery.html&amp;h=374&amp;w=488&amp;sz=70&amp;hl=en&amp;start=1&amp;sig2=KG92WQcYML0bxfUZ8ec8rA&amp;um=1&amp;tbnid=Zu93w2_n62yUpM:&amp;tbnh=100&amp;tbnw=130&amp;ei=oWgdSPSmFJTopgSRnIT7CQ&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dmacross%2Bplus%2Bmyung%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DG" rel="nofollow">and the dreams they left behind</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.monsterdesign.co.kr/image_2007/area88_440.jpg" rel="nofollow">The movie poster looks like this of course</a><br/><br/><i>14) Here is how I want players to interact in the game (GM, players, etc), and I will include an example or two if I have a way, in game (rules, setting, theme, mood, etc), to help that interaction take place.</i><br/><br/>Players create the mercenary company they fly for, determining its size, resources (and allocation of those resources), where the squadron is located and its employer, who the enemy is, and their characters\u2019 allies.

They may also hate using cards to handle conflicts (though I\u2019m not married to the idea at this point). They may also hate the art direction - I'm in the manga business so I'm partial to this style of art (but given the inspiration, I find it appropriate).<br/><br/><i>17) Here are my unique design goals, if any. I will also briefly describe any of the struggles I am currently having with each.</i><br/><br/>I want a system where the primary conflict involves maneuvering to get in an advantageous position over your enemy in order to shoot him down, literally, in the air, or figuratively, in any other sort of conflict. Since air combat is a major theme, there has to be a lot of it, but it can\u2019t be a wargame. In order to achieve the right feel, games like this tend to veer into wargame territory, rating planes for various technical factors, using maps and strict movement/positioning rules that take the focus off the pilots and more on playing the game as a simulation, and I really want to avoid this.<br/><br/><i>18) Here are my unique publishing goals, if any. I will also briefly describe any challenges I foresee with each.</i><br/><br/>I\u2019d like to see this in PDF and POD format. I\u2019d like to have nice art done in the manga style, by someone who can really draw airplanes and finding someone who can do this may be difficult. I\u2019m really big on the visual aspect of this game.<br/><br/><i>19) This is where I am currently talking about this game, or how to get a hold of me if you want to know more.</i><br/><br/>Right here on Storygames.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142254/#Comment_142254" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-04T01:23:21+00:00" title="May  4, 2008  1:23AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something broke this thread...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142257/#Comment_142257" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-04T01:46:35+00:00" title="May  4, 2008  1:46AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>Something broke this thread...</blockquote>\nThe awesomeness of the idea caused it to explode...

Mine's starfighter pilots, on the run, fighting for freedom against the Earth Democracy. But starfighters are just aircraft you don't have to worry about stalling, so most of the concepts here apply. <br/><br/>I've got more accomplished on the setting than the rules, but my high level idea is for the game to have three modes or levels. The top level is strategic/fleet level conflict that determines where the tactical battles are going to take place. This level is about gaining territory and winning hearts and minds. It has some board game elements (markers on the planets in the system). The middle level is the tactical combat - starfighters in dogfights and capital ships pounding on each other. I'm toying with this using maps and miniatures, but I'm staying well away from vector physics and riduculous speed/movement rules that ruin most of these games for me. Like Joshua, I see it as a contest for position and that's what my rules are all about. I'm still struggling with a lot of the details at this level, but I have a good idea of where I want to go. The bottom level is all the out-of-the-cockpit drama and will play as a fairly narrative story game.<br/><br/>In my game, these levels are played in order. You make strategic decisions as a group, that creates NPCs and relationships (hearts and minds) and leads to tactical battles. In the tactical battles the PCs will often need to sacrifice and take risks in order to gain tactical advantages. This results in suffering to their relationships that gets played out in consequence scenes at the personal level. And relationships can be used to gain a strategic edge at the top level and you start over. Ideally you would play one full cycle per game session - this should allow for having different players each session if group members can't make it every time.<br/><br/>The PCs have three attributes - Discipline, Guts, and Conviction - that suffer much like aspects in "With Great Power..." These three attributes have some descriptive qualities as well and are used in combat in the middle level. So if during combat a pilot decides to take bonus Discipline dice (or cards, or whatever I settle on) to out-turn her enemy, she would have a scene after the combat where she's getting chewed out for breaking formation and we get to see how she responds or the consequence could be forgetting to call her husband for a week and not helping him with their son's discipline problems at school. Whatever the player wants as long as the story and characters are developed through these consequences.<br/><br/>A lot of the story of this game is going to be about the people back home and what you're willing to sacrifice for freedom. <br/><br/>But it's still very early as I started out writing d20 starship combat rules the way I wanted to see them done, discovered Story Games and put it aside for a while, then started to think about how to make it in a style I would enjoy now, and here I am working on it again. I got a friend involved a few weeks ago and that's when some of the ideas and structure started to gel; it's so helpful to have...help. So now I'm enthusiastic about it again and need to carve out more time to work on it.<br/><br/>This thread has been helpful to give me some new ideas and things to look at. Hopefully you can take some ideas from what I've posted too.

I mean, yeah, most air forces these days get used on strike missions a lot more than they do on air superiority missions (which is why there are so few pure fighter aircraft designed anymore - most American aircraft are designated F/A rather than one or the other). But the default setting I'm thinking of is going to be the mid-70's to mid-80's, still the Cold War with lots of proxy brushfire wars going on, and everyone flying around Vietnam-era aircraft - all the fly-by-wire stuff is still on the drawing boards at that point. But yeah, good moral quandries fit the genre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142285/#Comment_142285" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-04T10:54:20+00:00" title="May  4, 2008 10:54AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>In my game, these levels are played in order. You make strategic decisions as a group, that creates NPCs and relationships (hearts and minds) and leads to tactical battles. In the tactical battles the PCs will often need to sacrifice and take risks in order to gain tactical advantages. This results in suffering to their relationships that gets played out in consequence scenes at the personal level. And relationships can be used to gain a strategic edge at the top level and you start over. Ideally you would play one full cycle per game session - this should allow for having different players each session if group members can't make it every time.</blockquote>\nI was thinking along these lines too. In Harms Way: Wild Blue has you making staff characters to argue the allocation of resources and negotiate contracts (though again it does little to support this mechanically other than suggesting the idea). But I'd like to see this expanded much the way you suggested. Maybe each session begins with these staff/company people working out a deal (which is to say, setting up the focus of the missions played out during the session), and then once it's settled, play kicks over to the pilots who have to deal with/suffer the consequences of those choices. And then of course, the outcome of what the pilots do affects the fortunes of the Company (including the resources they have) and what the staff level people have to deal with next time.<br/><br/>I have an image of a couple of finely groomed suits sitting in a London office overlooking the Thames meeting with the be-ribboned General of the sub-Saharan country of Mertrusa and agreeing on a contract that allows him to utilize the services of the Black Tiger squadron to support his offensive against the neighboring country of Ikawe (so he can capture their diamond mines)...and then we cut to the FAB where Lt.

BVR engagements have mostly come into their own in the last 20 years. Post-Vietnam to end-of-the-Cold War era missile combat is not at all conducted at hundreds of miles (I believe the Phoenix missile was one of the first such long range air-to-air missiles to become available in this period, and would thus be very rare, and very expensive, and probably not all that reliable). At any rate, you're looking at mid-generation AIM-7's and 9's with a lock-on range of something like 15-20 miles (depending on your search radar), which is nearly visual range given sharp eyesight and clear weather. Plus, radar guided missiles of the period often failed to track. You can fire these off and bug out, but if you plan to merge, that 15 miles closes up real fast and you're in a dogfight. There you maneuver to get on your opponent's tail for an IR missile shot (a Sidewinder, frex) which, if you're lucky, you have the all-aspect kind you can fire from almost any angle, but otherwise mean you need to be within a decent angle of your enemy's tailpipe, and within about 3 miles. And if you're that close, it can get you into guns range (under 1,000 yards) very quickly. Essentially what I'm saying is, even with missiles, air combat is still a dogfight (witness the USAF re-learning the art in order to compete with the NVAF during Viet Nam).\n<blockquote><p>So:<br/>If you launch your missiles at the<em>beginning</em>of combat, your opponent will maneuver, flare, and chaff their way away from them, but now he's shown his badassitude and that means you have to step up.

Choosing which weapons to use is a tactical choice that I want reflected in game play, but not one that equates to having more or less guts than the other. If you get a kill, you get a kill. That said, trying to get a guns kill is definitely worthy of respect among fighter jocks, as much for it's relative rarity as for its difficulty.\n<blockquote><p>Now, I've been thinking a lot about our culture's relationship to heroism and warriorhood, and this might be saying more about my very skeptical ideas about that than what you're after.

Chickening out in a fight and having a reduced hand size (or reduced E, or whatever) is good. I don't really agree that fighting that way (BVR missile engagements) would necessarily damage your rep, but given that the Phoenix seems to be something of a unique weapon system for the time, (and only deployed n the F-14) the easy way around dealing with it is to just not make it available, or if it is, it's more a plot device ("The enemy is arming their planes with Phoneix missiles, so watch out.")\n<blockquote><p>Also, yes, you're right, not "hundreds".

It seems to me that what weapons you use tends to depend on range, position, and of course situation (I need to read up on this). For example, I wouldn't waste a Sparrow, an all-aspect, medium-range, radar homing missile (which is much more expensive as well) on a shot at a target I was tailing at a range of say 2 miles, when a cheaper IR homing Sidewinder will get the job done just as well (or better even). Unless of course, all I had left on my rack is a Sparrow. And then the choice is there again, if I'm at 2 miles on a bandit's 6 and all I have is one Sparrow left, and the money's <i>that</i> important to me, well, I can push the throttle forward and go to guns range. Or break off, let the guy go and just suck it up. <br/><br/>I think type of target dictating the weapon you use (particularly in fight-to-fighter combat) is less frequent unless it's obvious from the situation. If your target is an unarmed transport or bomber with no escorts, you can kill it at your leisure from whatever range you choose with whatever weapons you feel like using. Then there're things like anti-ship missiles but that's beside the point. Otherwise, in a dogfight, you use whatever you've got in order to win.\n<blockquote>Obviously, since you're a mercenary, you have to purchase them, but if that's a real resource expenditure, the choice has to be between whether the investment in this missile will get your twin sister out of prison or if it will help you win the battle but not accomplish your goals.</blockquote>\nI like the image of a guy deciding to close for a guns kill because he<i> doesn't </i>want to fire that last Sparrow, so he can buy his sister out jail. And maybe in the short range gunfight he's just decided to risk, he gets blown out of the sky. Awesome!<br/><br/>That's great! \n<blockquote><p>You might want to look at Psi Run, Red Sky A.M., or Otherkind (in order of availability) for a neat way of dealing with that, by the way: basically, it works like this: you roll a bunch of dice and allocate them toward mission success, personal safety, and safety of bystanders. 1s indicate disaster of some sort.

So thanks for all the suggestions (and keep them coming). I tend to get frustrated and give up when it comes time to actually try to gel everything and write it down, so if I can see a way forward from here, I may actually get over that hump this time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Are you asking what the player gets out of it specifically aside from the thrill of being able to say "Splash one!"? I mean, I, as a player, would be very happy to have things go my way in the dogfight game and flame a bandit or two. The player would get some sort of reward that benefits his character naturally. The monetary bounty for the kill of course, a boost in the character's rep/status/ or whatever I use to track that if it is a factor, and most definitely a boost to the characters' Energy (to maintain that idea) which will probably end up pushing them toward resolution of whatever issues they have. You want more Energy? You gotta get in the air and shoot down bandits. Build up lots of Energy and things go can go your way (maybe). Not enough Energy and you Stall Out, headed for a crash...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142496/#Comment_142496" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T14:48:10+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  2:48PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2008 2:58PM by Mike Montesa.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Very Cool.<br><br>Why Jets?</br></br></blockquote>\nBecause I like them.

The early Korean war stuff was jets with guns only, and the modern stuff we have today is awesome but the kinks in the technology that is taken for granted now (like air-to-air missiles), make missile engagements somewhat unreliable back in this period (often meaning closing to gun range). The planes are still specialized (a carrier flight deck back then might have 5 or 6 different planes with different roles on deck, nowadays it's the F/A-18 and that's it - well, maybe not but you get my point) and that's cool too. The next generation of fighters after what we have now...likely more and more un-manned aircraft. That's my justification, but really, I just like the aircraft of the period, groove on the source material, and that's good enough for me.\n<blockquote>This seems to be screaming for some Sky Captain of Tomorrow Alt History.</blockquote>\nUrgh.

If I have to stretch disbelief anywhere, maybe this is where I have to stretch it. But I'm not dwelling on it much - such contrivances are often used in the service of a cool idea anyway. I suppose it could be adapted to handle those other eras if the premise is the same.

This is what I'm worst at - mechanics, and where I'm most likely to throw my hands up and walk away. But here's what I'm after, in sort of a brain-fart mode of just pitching things out there:<br><br>1. Something that captures the move and counter-move of air combat. This is key for me and this game must-have it. I'm working on a system with a selection of maneuvers you can use depending on how much Energy you've got. For example, a Break (a hard turn) costs maybe 5E (I'm just making up some numbers), a Scissors costs 10E. A Break trumps a Break but not a Scissors, a Scissors trumps a Scissors <i>and</i> a Break, and so forth (I've got a basic list of maneuvers and a matrix of what trumps what). Then, once you've successfully played a maneuver on your opponent that he can't trump, you can take a shot at him (and depending on range and other factors you might hit or miss of course). Taking the shot also requires Energy, which you may have burned up just getting in position for the shot, but that's what energy management in a dogfight is about.<br><br>2. That Energy you're using in combat in the air is an innate characteristic of each character. The plane he or she flies adds its own E rating to what the pilot has to use in the dogfight. You regain energy each turn of air combat by using Thrust, which is also an innate characteristic of each pilot (representing motivation) and each plane (representing its actual power). There may be other innate characteristics pilots and planes both share (for example, Structural Integrity, representing how much stress and punishment a pilot or plane can take; Afterburner, an extra boost of Energy that helps in a pinch but taxes you severely) . Basically, the planes add to the pilots' characteristics depending on the model (and having differences between the aircraft based on their actual performance is also a must-have for me, even if this is abstracted in the most simple way - an F-16 is an all-around better aircraft than a Mig-21 for example).<br><br>3. Play goes in rounds, a ground scene focused on one character (but which can and should involve other players) dealing directly with the spotlight character's issues. Energy may be spent or gained depending on what happens and at the end of the ground scene, there is a mission in which everyone participates. When the mission is over the next character gets his ground scene, then there's another mission, and so on.<br><br>4. A character's story arcs with their Energy. Once it reaches "Buster" (modern aviation slang for maximum speed) it's going to end. If the character hasn't successfully dealt with their personal baggage (somehow reflected mechanically) the end reflects that. If they've resolved their issue, the end reflects that too. Likewise, should a character's Energy drop below Stall Speed (which I can't get a grip on how to work it yet) they're going to crash and burn. Stall with unresolved baggage and it'll be a really bad ending. Stall out with your issue resolved and it's simply tragic (come to think of it, resolving your issue and then getting killed in the Mission is perhaps even more tragic). Some way to pull out or eject from this fate would be good. You can go Buster or Stall Out in a ground scene or a Mission scene, but the effects of these two always carry through to the end of the Mission scene, and if the character survives the mission, their story ends one way or the other and they get written out.<br/><br/>5. The "Contract Negotiation" for each session of play is set up at the beginning, with the players allocating certain available resources to their squadron. This represents the company suits and staff in the head office in Pretoria deciding who gets what and what they have to do with it. I think it would be cool to have these people be actual minor characters involved in the story as well. In the next step -  "Mission Package" - Players then allocate their share of the resources to their pilots' for each mission to be played that session (in the form of armaments, fuel, and repairs to their aircraft - or even new aircraft if it comes to that). Of course, if a pilot hasn't got enough money in his account to pay for everything (despite its availability, he may have to do without). If the game is a campaign, then the performance of the squadron is evaluated at the end and affects what resources the Suits are working with in the Mission package stage next time around.<br/><br/>I'm going to try and cook this for a while and see if I can get it to gel for me.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142628/#Comment_142628" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T08:45:21+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  8:45AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The biggest issue I think you're going to have with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is multiple plane furballs.

Ain't nuthin' set in stone (or written down anywhere else but here) yet. :-) Maybe everyone gets their Ground Scene (sequentially) and then you go on a Mission? For these scenes on the ground I am thinking vaguely of PTA and how characters get spotlight time and how that rotates around. When you're in the spotlight it's all about you and it's your Energy that's flowing most freely. If it's not your scene, you can still be involved though there would be some limit on how much E your could earn or lose. Maybe if you wanted to sit out of someone else's Ground Scene or were simply not involved, you just get a minimum amount of E, with no risk of loss, but if your character was involved in the scene you could gain more E (and risk losing more - though not as much as the spotlight character). I dunno, something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It's all disorganized notes and brainstorming, but it's a start. As I mentioned up-thread, I've never gotten this far with anything like this so I must be on to something here. :-) I'm trying hard not to get hung up on any sticking points and just get the ideas for the entire thing out there so I can see some sort of structure to it. It's far too easy for me to hit a wall with something I can't figure out how to get past, so I just need to keep going, however rough and unfinished it looks. My intake of aircraft and air combat media has also increased at an alarming rate (my wife was griping at me about the books on the Linebacker air campaign in Vietnam I just ordered)... ;-)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

The thing I like here is the idea that even though you may resolve your issue, you still might get killed in your last mission anyway. It sets up a nice little matrix of possible outcomes:<br/><br/>Issue resolved + get killed = nice tragic ending (cue violins)<br/>Issue resolved + don't get killed = happy ending <br/>Issue unresolved/goes badly/gets even worse + get killed = got what you deserved (maybe)<br/>Issue unresolved/goes badly/gets even worse + don't get killed = damned for the rest of your life<br/><br/>This raises a question - should getting killed along the way to the last mission be a real threat? I really would like it to be but I dunno for sure - death needs to be an ever-present threat I feel. I suppose it depends on my priorities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143069/#Comment_143069" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T10:49:24+00:00" title="May  8, 2008 10:49AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2008 11:10AM by Mike Montesa.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, I'm thinking now about "Contract Negotiation" which sort of sets the scene for the upcoming episode.

Perhaps the rebels are on the offensive and heading for the capital (or maybe they\u2019re already in the capital); maybe the President\u2019s family is being flown out of the country and the rebels are trying to shoot them down; the Soviets have sent in advisors to help the other side train their pilots; and so on.

No matter how hard he fought in the air, the system was designed to keep him in the air.<br/>\n  Also, the air combat in Area 88 is very much a fantasy-style air combat. Lots of silly maneuvers that in real life would probably get you killed.<br/>\n  Also, the character interaction reminded me more of WWI where there was supposed to be some honor between pilots and somehow the pilots knew each other by reputation. Something that could not really happen in more modern combat (seeing as you can fire off a missile at a mile or two away).<br/>\n  I think you need to capture that tense decision where every bullet you buy takes you a step further away from your goal of not being a mercenary any more, no?<br/>\n  Anyways, I think if you can put together a mechanic that takes the energy you have each round and divides it between defense, offense and energy for next round, you have a winner.<br/>\n  Good luck man,<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143278/#Comment_143278" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T08:25:35+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  8:25AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, instead of energy being something you spend, it could be something you allocate.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can then suffer damage that reduces your energy, or voluntarily burn it for some short term advantage...Like go for the kill NOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat could be as simple as energy being a die pool and each different use being a different color.  Throw and go.  To pull off a manuever you need different combinations of dice...say 3 green speed dice, 2 red attack dice, and 1 blue defense die.  Your total effectiveness at the maneuver is the sum of the dice used (or the sum of the top 3 dice if you don't want bigger maneuvers to have larger totals).<br/>\n<br/>\nAllocating energy in the old Xwing vs Tie Fighter game was half the fun of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143280/#Comment_143280" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T08:29:55+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  8:29AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>However, it does assume that you aren't going to actually be risking death until you get to the end, though you would (should) be risking everything else.

As a player, that gives me the security to throw in all sorts of cool character-driven roleplaying without having to worry if this is my last mission ever. If I feel secure that my guy is still in until the Final Battle, Where Everything Gets Resolved, then I'll be pushing the character's story pretty hard, instead of gaming the system in order to survive.<br><br>Some people might have a problem with that, it not being immersive or something, but that safety net adds to emulating the fiction.

But, if I see you in the air, I'll do what I was paid to do."<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Yeah, instead of energy being something you spend, it could be something you allocate.<br/><br/>You can then suffer damage that reduces your energy, or voluntarily burn it for some short term advantage...Like go for the kill NOW.</blockquote>\nThat would be kicking your afterburners! Zoom!\n<blockquote>That could be as simple as energy being a die pool and each different use being a different color.  Throw and go.  To pull off a manuever you need different combinations of dice...say 3 green speed dice, 2 red attack dice, and 1 blue defense die.  Your total effectiveness at the maneuver is the sum of the dice used (or the sum of the top 3 dice if you don't want bigger maneuvers to have larger totals).<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI <i>really</i> like this idea and I'll need to try to work it out some. I was starting to think of a deck of maneuver cards that you play on each other, but I had some trepidations about that as I like dice rolling (for RPG stuff). Plus making cards is a PITA. (sigh) I really suck at mechanics...<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>However, it does assume that you aren't going to actually be risking death until you get to the end, though you would (should) be risking everything else. Does that work for people?</blockquote>\nI think that's pretty cool. As a player, that gives me the security to throw in all sorts of cool character-driven roleplaying without having to worry if this is my last mission ever. If I feel secure that my guy is still in until the Final Battle, Where Everything Gets Resolved, then I'll be pushing the character's story pretty hard, instead of gaming the system in order to survive.<br/><br/>Some people might have a problem with that, it not being immersive or something, but that safety net adds to emulating the fiction. It's only the supporting cast that ever goes down in flames before the end of the story, right..?<br/><br/>Yes, I guess this is simply a question of priorities and "You can't please everyone." Simulation or story? Personally, I prefer to avoid random death and follow the character's arc til he meets his resolution. Seeing as how I intend for this final mission (for that particular character) to be triggered by his Energy running out (or overloading), it can happen at different times and different rates. So on any given mission, it could be one character's final battle as he resolves his story. Other pilots who are on this character's final mission with him get to watch (since they're still riding their arcs to <i>their</i> own ends). Then back at the base after it's all over:<br/><br/>"Man, too bad Skyhawk had to die. I mean his fiance actually came here to meet him and all." <br/><br/>"Skyhawk augered in? Aww hell..."<br/><br/>"Sonofabitch got what he deserved if you ask me." <br/><br/>"Fuck it. Don't mean nuthin..."<br/><br/>"Hey, you guys, I'm cleaning out Skyhawk's locker. Who wants his stack of dirty magazines?"<br/><br/>See, if it can happen at any time for any given character, then in the context of the fiction of the <i>entire squadron</i>, it seems like it was a more random end. If you have four players and one guy is really going for it and reaches his character's conclusion before everyone else, if he lives and walks away, well it seems appropriate. If he dies, well, maybe it's tragic maybe not. And it doesn't mean that player who finished has to go home now. He can make another new merc and bring this guy in and begin a new arc. <br/><br/>Plus the death or departure of a squadron mate who is close to your character can boost or sap your Energy, so it can have a story as well as a mechanical effect.<br/><br/>Ooh!

So the players could have other members of the squadron buy the farm instead of their PCs, but it affects morale, or something. You could lose Grudge dice when your rival dies, or you could maybe write in a new Belief for revenge to gain dice instead of losing them. Or a new flaw like Guilty Conscience or Deathwish.<br/><br/>If you want some of that randomness, though, players could have multiple characters, and they can decide which one dies. Or, which ones to risk, and then if the dice o badly, cest la vie. That might give players the option of having one main guy and 2-3 cannon fodder, or 2-4 guys on the squad and they can nudge the variables over who lives and who dies a bit. If they really like one character and he dies, they can just switch to another one, who already has a history.<br/><br/>Or those supporting cast squad members could be held in common by the group, instead of being parceled out to players at the start.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>Yah.

In this case, setting up the mission would be initial contact with the enemy, not the briefing room scene, but that could be pretty cool as well. Or mission set-up is the rumors going around about the next mission, even before the briefing (which could always be skipped). This gives the players a chance to set their characters up for conflicts and stories within the context of what they already know about the enemy.<br/><br/>Sarge: "Our intel says to expect an attack on Tighana's oil fields.

I'm trying to figure out how to set up the mechanics in the context of overall game play. Here's the idea:<br/><br/>1. A character's story arcs with his Energy. When it hits Buster (maximum) or Stall Speed (minimum), the character's story ends, for better or worse.<br/>2. Each player gets a Ground Scene, in which their character deals with their Baggage in some way, followed by a Mission Scene in which everyone participates. For characters who have gone Buster or hit Stall Speed in a Ground Scene, the next Mission Scene is also their final mission.<br/>    Note: For this, I'm considering making one player the Aggressor, the person who plays the characters in opposition to the spotlight character. Yes, this makes it a GM-less game and I'm not sure if that'll work. If I go this route, the player paying the Aggressor needs to get some benefit from it.<br/>3. In Ground Scenes, spotlight characters can gain or lose Energy (which they'll need in the Mission Scene) by wagering it on conflicts directly related to and addressing their Baggage.<br/>4. In Mission Scenes, characters use Energy to attempt to complete the Mission. Success means an Energy gain for everyone, while failure means a loss of Energy. <br/>   Here's where I'm getting a bit stuck. According to my concept, I want there to be a strong air-combat focus, with lots of specific maneuvering going on, and pilots countering each other's moves. I want this to be conducted with the Energy attribute, using E as a dice pool in some fashion (I like the allocation of dice idea; I'm thinking Maneuver, which puts you into firing position; Response, which check Maneuvers, other Responses, and Attacks; and Attacks, which do just that).<br/><br/>OK, maybe that's fine but, how can I extend this mechanic to what happens in Ground Scenes? Just do the same thing only make "Maneuver" "Response" and "Attack" more metaphoric?<br/><br/>The thrust of the whole idea is, integration of the game mechanics between Ground and Mission Scenes. I'm not too sure if I've got the right angle of attack going here in terms of my approach to overall design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo" title="1000buffalo"><img alt="1000buffalo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.jadelantern.com/lantern/images/GoPlayLantern.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo">1000buffalo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143414/#Comment_143414" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-11T04:55:37+00:00" title="May 11, 2008  4:55AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off, Mike, this rocketh!  <br/><br/>When it's ready for a shakedown, we should put up a CAP from <a href="http://www.endgameoakland.com" rel="nofollow">EndGame</a>.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>Hi!<br/>Also, the air combat in Area 88 is very much a fantasy-style air combat.
